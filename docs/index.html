The answer "128" shows they have comprehended the task, even though their thinking process is extremely condensed.</p>

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> To show this, since $|\Psi|$ is exponentially decaying, we only need to show that the integral over a spherical shell is 0 . To show this, we can show that the integral of $\mathbf{B}$ inside a sphere of radius $R$ is independent of $R$. Indeed, this quickly follows from dimensional analysis (the only relevant quantities are $\mu_{0}, \mu_{p}$, and $R$, and one can check that $\mu_{0} \mu_{p}$ already gives the right dimensions, and there is no dimensionless combination of these 3 quantities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver employs dimensional analysis to argue that the integral of the magnetic field inside a sphere must be independent of the radius R, by examining the dimensions of the relevant physical quantities and determining that there's no dimensionless combination that could introduce R-dependence.</p>

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> First, we prove no other values are possible. Let $\ell(x, y)$ denote the label of cell $(x, y)$. \section*{The label is divisible by 3.} Observe that for any $x$ and $y, \ell(x, y), \ell(x, y+1)$, and \ell(x+1, y)$ are all distinct mod 3 . Thus, for any $a$ and $b, \ell(a+1, b+1)$ cannot match \ell(a+1, b)$ or \ell(a, b+1) \bmod 3$, so it must be equivalent to \ell(a, b)$ modulo 3 . Since \ell(a, b+1), \ell(a, b+2), \ell(a+1, b+1)$ are all distinct \bmod 3$, and \ell(a+1, b+1)$ and \ell(a, b)$ are equivalent \bmod 3$, then \ell(a, b), \ell(a, b+1), \ell(a, b+2)$ are all distinct \bmod 3$, and thus similarly \ell(a, b+$ $1), \ell(a, b+2), \ell(a, b+3)$ are all distinct \bmod 3$, which means that \ell(a, b+3)$ must be neither \ell(a, b+1)$ or \ell(a, b+2) \bmod 3$, and thus must be equal to \ell(a, b) \bmod 3$. These together imply that $$\ell(w, x) \equiv \ell(y, z) \bmod 3 \Longleftrightarrow w-x \equiv y-z \bmod 3$$ It follows that \ell(2000,2024)$ must be equivalent to \ell(0,0) \bmod 3$, which is a multiple of 3 .</p>

   For each part \(i\) (where \(i = 1, 2, \dots, k\)), there are \(i\) questions, each with \(i+1\) answer choices. The probability of getting a single question wrong is \(\frac{i}{i+1}\). Therefore, the probability of getting all \(i\) questions wrong in part \(i\) is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{i}{i+1} \right)^i
   \]
   The probability of getting all questions wrong in all \(k\) parts is the product of the probabilities for each part:
   \[
   P(\text{no questions correct}) = \prod_{i=1}^k \left( \frac{i}{i+1} \right)^i
   \]

2. **Calculate the probability of getting exactly one question correct:**

   To get exactly one question correct, we consider the probability of getting one question correct in each part \(i\) and all other questions wrong. For part \(i\), the probability of getting one specific question correct and the remaining \(i-1\) questions wrong is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{i}{i+1} \right)^{i-1} \cdot \frac{1}{i+1}
   \]
   Since there are \(i\) questions in part \(i\), there are \(i\) ways to choose which question is correct. Thus, the probability for part \(i\) is:
   \[
   i \cdot \left( \frac{i}{i+1} \right)^{i-1} \cdot \frac{1}{i+1} = \left( \frac{i}{i+1} \right)^i
   \]
   This is the same as the probability of getting all questions wrong in part \(i\). Therefore, the total probability of getting exactly one question correct in any of the \(k\) parts is:
   \[
   P(\text{exactly one question correct}) = k \cdot \prod_{i=1}^k \left( \frac{i}{i+1} \right)^i
   \]

3. **Set up the given condition:**

   According to the problem, the probability of getting exactly one question correct is 2018 times the probability of getting no questions correct:
   \[
   k \cdot \prod_{i=1}^k \left( \frac{i}{i+1} \right)^i = 2018 \cdot \prod_{i=1}^k \left( \frac{i}{i+1} \right)^i
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   k = 2018
   \]</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The entire solution demonstrates sequential processing as the solver breaks down the problem into logical steps: first calculating the probability of no correct answers, then the probability of exactly one correct answer, then setting up the equation based on the given condition, and finally calculating the total number of questions. Each step builds on the previous ones in a systematic manner.</p>

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> It may take some trial and error to find the smallest and largest possible values of $x$ under these conditions.  The smallest is $x=34$, because $3x=102$, the smallest three-digit multiple of $3$.  If we tried anything smaller than $34$, $x$, $2x$, and $3x$ would all have two digits, and that doesn't satisfy the condition.

The largest possible value of $x$ is $49$, because if $x$ were $50$, $2x$ would equal $100$, and only one multiple of $x$ would have two digits.</p>

6. **Identify returning points**:

   Now, consider any \( x \in S \). We need to show that \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x - y) \) also has norm 1 and is orthogonal to all \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x_i - y) \).

   Let \( e = x - y \). We need:

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> To solve this problem, we need to find the expected number of days it will take Emilia to obtain six perfectly-shaped apple trees. We will use the concept of expected value and probability to solve this problem.

1. **Define the Random Variable:**
   Let \( X \) be the number of days it takes to turn all six saplings into perfectly-shaped apple trees.

2. **Probability of Success:**
   Each day, the probability that a single sapling turns into a perfectly-shaped apple tree is \( \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, the probability that a sapling does not turn into a perfectly-shaped apple tree on a given day is also \( \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   We need to calculate the expected value \( E(X) \). We will use the fact that the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their expected values.

4. **Expected Value for Each Tree:**
   Let \( E_i \) be the expected number of days to turn the \( i \)-th sapling into a perfectly-shaped apple tree. Since each sapling has an independent probability of \( \frac{1}{2} \) to turn into a tree each day, the expected number of days for one sapling is:
   \[
   E_i = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^k = 2
   \]
   This is because the expected value of a geometric distribution with success probability \( p \) is \( \frac{1}{p} \).

5. **Expected Value for All Trees:**
   Since the trees are independent, the expected number of days for all six trees is the sum of the expected values for each tree. However, we need to account for the fact that the trees are not all independent in terms of the total time taken. We use the linearity of expectation and the fact that the expected value of the maximum of independent geometric random variables is given by:
   \[
   E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{6} \frac{1}{i}
   \]
   This is because the expected value of the maximum of \( n \) independent geometric random variables with parameter \( p \) is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{i} \).

6. **Harmonic Series:**
   The sum \( \sum_{i=1}^{6} \frac{1}{i} \) is the 6th harmonic number:
   \[
   H_6 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6}
   \]

7. **Calculate the Harmonic Number:**
   \[
   H_6 = 1 + 0.5 + 0.3333 + 0.25 + 0.2 + 0.1667 = 2.45
   \]

8. **Expected Value:**
   Therefore, the expected number of days \( E(X) \) is:
   \[
   E(X) = 2 \cdot H_6 = 2 \cdot 2.45 = 4.9
   \]

9. **Simplify the Fraction:**
   The expected number of days is \( \frac{49}{10} \). Here, \( m = 49 \) and \( n = 10 \).

10. **Final Calculation:**
    \[
    100m + n = 100 \cdot 49 + 10 = 4900 + 10 = 4910
    \]

The final answer is \( \boxed{4910} \).</p>

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> Let us define the rapidity as
$$
\tanh \phi \equiv \beta=\frac{v}{c}
$$

where tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function. Let $\beta_{1}=\tanh \phi_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}=\tanh \phi_{2}$. If we add $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ using the relativistic velocity addition formula, we find that

$$
\beta=\frac{\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}}{1-\beta_{1} \beta_{2}}=\frac{\tanh \phi_{1}+\tanh \phi_{2}}{1+\tanh \phi_{1} \tanh \phi_{2}}=\tanh \left(\phi_{1}+\phi_{2}\right)
$$

We can then rewrite the problem as

$$
v_{f}=\tanh \left(\operatorname{arctanh} \frac{1}{3}+\operatorname{arctanh} \frac{2}{4}+\cdots+\operatorname{arctanh} \frac{20}{22}\right)
$$



Using the fact that $\operatorname{arctanh}(\phi)=\frac{1}{2} \ln \left(\frac{1+\phi}{1-\phi}\right)$, we can find that

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{f} & =\tanh \left(\frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=0}^{19} \ln \left(\frac{1+\frac{k+1}{k+3}}{1-\frac{k+1}{k+3}}\right)\right)=\tanh \left(\frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=0}^{19} \ln (k+2)\right) \\
& =\tanh (\ln \sqrt{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdots 21})=\tanh (\ln \sqrt{21 !})
\end{aligned}
$$

As $\tanh \phi=\left(e^{\phi}-e^{-\phi}\right) /\left(e^{\phi}+e^{-\phi}\right)$, then

$$
\tanh (\ln (\phi))=\frac{\phi-\frac{1}{\phi}}{\phi+\frac{1}{\phi}}=1-\frac{2}{\phi^{2}+1} \Longrightarrow v_{f}=1-\frac{2}{21 !+1}
$$

This implies 19 zeros, but you can also use Stirlings approximation to further approximate the factorial.</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The entire first approach demonstrates systematic decomposition, as the solver breaks down the complex relativistic velocity problem into a series of logical steps: first introducing rapidity, then expressing the problem as a sum of arctanh values, then converting to logarithms, then to a factorial, and finally evaluating the expression to find the number of 9s.</p>

Compound AxBy belongs to solid substances that can scratch quartz. According to the Mohs hardness scale, it can be, for example, corundum (Al2O3) or silicon carbide (SiC). «A simple substance of one of the elements can react with water after the removal of the oxide film from its surface» - additional clue pointing to aluminum.
Elements B and C form a gaseous substance BxCy, which is soluble in water and has acidic properties (causing litmus paper to turn red in the solution). CO2 gas is not suitable in this case because it does not match the initial conditions of the task, while SO2 is suitable.
Thus, element A – aluminium, B – sulfur and C – oxygen. Substance AB is aluminum oxide Al2O3 (corundum), gas BC – sulfur (IV) dioxide SO2
The reactions involved in this task:
2Al + 3S = Al2S3
Al2S3 + 6H2O = 2Al(OH)3 + 3H2S (flammable gas, salts - Na2S, (NH4)2S)

   - Suppose we have a solution \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^n x_k = 27
     \]
     and
     \[
     \prod_{k=1}^n x_k = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24}
     \]
   - Assume \( x_1 < 0 \). We need to find two reals \( x \) and \( y \) such that:
     \[
     x + y = x_1
     \]
     and
     \[
     xy = x_1
     \]
   - Consider the quadratic equation:
     \[
     t^2 - x_1 t + x_1 = 0
     \]
   - The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:
     \[
     \Delta = x_1^2 - 4x_1
     \]
   - Since \( x_1 < 0 \), \( \Delta > 0 \), so the quadratic equation has two real solutions. Let \( x \) be the negative solution and \( y \) be the positive solution.
   - Then the \( n+1 \)-tuple \( x, y, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) is a solution, and the first coordinate is \( < 0 \).</p>

   We claim that \( |G_i S_i^{-1}| = k^2 \) and \( G_i S_i^{-1} \cap G_j S_j^{-1} \) is empty for \( i \neq j \). If \( g_i s_i^{-1} = g_i a b^{-1} s_i^{-1} \) where \( a \in G_1 \) and \( b \in S_1 \), then \( a = b \), which is possible if and only if \( a = b = e \). This shows that:

4. **Calculate the total number of fish in the lake on May 1:**
   - The ratio of tagged to untagged fish on May 1 was \(\frac{1}{14}\).

2. Consider the element \( 1 + x^{k-1} \). We need to show that \( (1 + x^{k-1})^n = 1 \).
3. Using the binomial theorem in the context of a ring, we have:
   \[
   (1 + x^{k-1})^n = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \binom{n}{i} (1)^{n-i} (x^{k-1})^i
   \]
4. Since \( x^k = 0 \), for \( i \geq 2 \), \( (x^{k-1})^i = x^{i(k-1)} = 0 \). Therefore, the sum reduces to:
   \[
   (1 + x^{k-1})^n = 1 + \binom{n}{1} x^{k-1} = 1 + n x^{k-1}
   \]
5. Given that \( (1 + x^{k-1})^n = 1 \), we have:
   \[
   1 + n x^{k-1} = 1
   \]
6. This implies \( n x^{k-1} = 0 \). Since \( A \) is a finite ring with \( n \) elements, \( n \) is the characteristic of the ring, meaning \( n \cdot a = 0 \) for all \( a \in A \). Thus, \( x^{k-1} = 0 \).
7. This contradicts the assumption that \( x^{k-1} \neq 0 \). Therefore, the only nilpotent element in \( A \) must be \( 0 \).</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver constructs a proof by contradiction for part (a). They assume there exists a non-zero nilpotent element, then strategically introduce the element 1+x^(k-1) and use the problem's given condition about x^n=1 having a unique solution to derive a contradiction. This shows sophisticated proof strategy selection and execution.</p>

   Let the 9 numbers in the set \( S \) be \( a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i \) such that \( a \leq b \leq c \leq d \leq e \leq f \leq g \leq h \leq i \).

2. **Calculate the total sum of the numbers in \( S \):**
   The mean of the numbers in \( S \) is 202. Therefore, the total sum of the numbers in \( S \) is:
   \[
   a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i = 9 \times 202 = 1818
   \]

3. **Calculate the sum of the five smallest numbers:**
   The mean of the five smallest numbers is 100. Therefore, the sum of the five smallest numbers is:
   \[
   a + b + c + d + e = 5 \times 100 = 500
   \]

4. **Calculate the sum of the five largest numbers:**
   The mean of the five largest numbers is 300. Therefore, the sum of the five largest numbers is:
   \[
   e + f + g + h + i = 5 \times 300 = 1500
   \]

5. **Combine the equations to find \( e \):**
   We have two equations:
   \[
   a + b + c + d + e = 500
   \]
   \[
   e + f + g + h + i = 1500
   \]
   Adding these two equations, we get:
   \[
   (a + b + c + d + e) + (e + f + g + h + i) = 500 + 1500
   \]
   \[
   a + b + c + d + 2e + f + g + h + i = 2000
   \]

6. **Use the total sum to solve for \( e \):**
   We know the total sum of all nine numbers is 1818. Therefore:
   \[
   a + b + c + d + 2e + f + g + h + i = 2000
   \]
   \[
   1818 + 2e = 2000
   \]
   \[
   2e = 2000 - 1818
   \]
   \[
   2e = 182
   \]
   \[
   e = \frac{182}{2} = 91
   \]

7. **Determine the median:**
   Since \( e \) is the fifth number in the ordered list and there are nine numbers, \( e \) is the median.</p>

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> 1. **Define the problem and notation:**
   Let \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \) be two finite groups such that for any finite group \( H \), the number of group homomorphisms from \( G_1 \) to \( H \) is equal to the number of group homomorphisms from \( G_2 \) to \( H \). We need to prove that \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \) are isomorphic.

2. **Introduce the concept of onto homomorphisms:**
   Denote \( \text{OntHom}(G, H) \) as the set of all onto homomorphisms from \( G \) to \( H \). Let \( H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_k \) be all pairwise different proper subgroups of \( H \).

3. **Count the onto homomorphisms:**
   Since \( \text{OntHom}(G, H_i) \cap \text{OntHom}(G, H_j) = \emptyset \) for any two \( i \neq j \), we have:
   \[
   |\text{OntHom}(G, H)| = |\text{Hom}(G, H)| - \sum_{i=1}^{k} |\text{OntHom}(G, H_i)|
   \]
   This equation expresses the number of onto homomorphisms from \( G \) to \( H \) in terms of the number of homomorphisms from \( G \) to \( H \) and the number of onto homomorphisms from \( G \) to the proper subgroups of \( H \).

4. **Recursive application to proper subgroups:**
   By applying the same reasoning to every proper subgroup \( H_i \) of \( H \), we can write \( |\text{OntHom}(G, H)| \) as a linear combination of \( |\text{Hom}(G, H_i)| \) for all subgroups \( H_i \) of \( H \). Since \( H \) is finite, this linear combination converges.

5. **Equality of homomorphisms implies equality of onto homomorphisms:**
   Given that \( |\text{Hom}(G_1, H)| = |\text{Hom}(G_2, H)| \) for any finite \( H \), it follows that:
   \[
   |\text{OntHom}(G_1, H)| = |\text{OntHom}(G_2, H)|
   \]
   for any finite \( H \).

6. **Application to \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \):**
   Taking \( H = G_2 \), we have \( |\text{OntHom}(G_1, G_2)| > 0 \) and similarly, taking \( H = G_1 \), we have \( |\text{OntHom}(G_2, G_1)| > 0 \). This implies that there exist onto homomorphisms from \( G_1 \) to \( G_2 \) and from \( G_2 \) to \( G_1 \).

7. **Conclusion of isomorphism:**
   Since there exist onto homomorphisms in both directions, \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \) must have the same order, i.e., \( |G_1| = |G_2| \). An onto homomorphism between two finite groups of the same order is a bijection, hence an isomorphism. Therefore, \( G_1 \cong G_2 \).</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The entire solution demonstrates forward chaining, as the solver starts with the given condition about equal numbers of homomorphisms and systematically works through a series of logical steps: introducing onto homomorphisms, developing counting formulas, applying recursive reasoning, making logical inferences, selecting strategic cases, and finally applying theoretical knowledge to reach the conclusion that G₁ and G₂ are isomorphic.</p>

On the other hand, timescale of a microlensing event is a function of the mass of the lensed object. In other words, microlensing event takes longer for more massive objects. On the other hand, telescope time is usually limited and they cannot be used for decades of observations. So, mass of the lensed object and duration of microlensing events are both a limiting factor for detection of very massive black holes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> 1. **Objective**: We need to show that there exists a separable and metrizable topology on \( X \) that is coarser than \( \tau \).

2. **Strategy**: We aim to find countably many real-valued continuous functions on \( (X, \tau) \) that separate the points of \( X \). These functions will provide a one-to-one continuous map of \( (X, \tau) \) into a countable product of real lines. The topology on \( X \) generated by this map will be separable and metrizable.

3. **Constructing the Functions**:
    - For each \( n \ge 1 \), let \( X_n \) be a maximal family of points in \( X \) such that the distance between any two points is at least \( \frac{1}{n} \). This ensures that \( X_n \) is a discrete set in the metric space.
    - For each \( m > n \), define \( X_n^m \) as the union of the closed balls of radius \( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{m} \) centered at the points of \( X_n \). 

4. **Properties of \( X_n \) and \( X_n^m \)**:
    - The set \( X_n \) has at most the cardinality of the continuum, by the hypothesis.
    - The set \( X_n^m \) is closed for every pair \( m > n \) of positive integers.
    - Each ball of radius \( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{m} \) is an open subset of \( X_n^m \).

5. **Defining the Functions**:
    - For each \( n \) and \( m \), we can find a real-valued continuous function \( f_{n,m} \) defined on \( X_n^m \) that is constant on each ball but assigns different values to different balls. This is possible due to the Urysohn Lemma, which states that for any two disjoint closed sets in a normal space, there exists a continuous function that maps one set to 0 and the other to 1.
    - Extend \( f_{n,m} \) to a continuous real-valued function on \( X \) using the Tietze Extension Theorem, which allows the extension of continuous functions defined on a closed subset of a normal space to the entire space.

6. **Separation of Points**:
    - The functions \( f_{n,m} \) separate the points of \( X \). For any two distinct points \( x \) and \( y \) in \( X \), there exists some \( n \) and \( m \) such that \( x \) and \( y \) lie in different balls in \( X_n^m \). Hence, \( f_{n,m}(x) \neq f_{n,m}(y) \).

7. **Conclusion**:
    - The countable family of functions \( \{ f_{n,m} \} \) provides a one-to-one continuous map from \( (X, \tau) \) into a countable product of real lines \( \mathbb{R}^\omega \).
    - The topology on \( X \) induced by this map is coarser than \( \tau \), separable, and metrizable.</p>

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> 1. **Define the constant \( c \):**
   Let \( c = \min\left(\inf_{x \in [0,1]} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}, \inf_{x \in [0,1]} \frac{g(x)}{f(x)}\right) \). Since \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are positive and continuous on the compact interval \([0,1]\), the infimums are achieved, and thus \( c \) is well-defined and positive.

2. **Identify the point where the minimum is achieved:**
   By the definition of \( c \), there exists some \( a \in [0,1] \) such that \( c = \frac{f(a)}{g(a)} \) or \( c = \frac{g(a)}{f(a)} \). Without loss of generality, assume \( c = \frac{f(a)}{g(a)} \). This implies \( f(a) = c g(a) \).

3. **Establish inequalities:**
   Since \( c \) is the minimum of the ratios, we have:
   \[
   \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \geq c \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{g(x)}{f(x)} \geq c \quad \text{for all } x \in [0,1].
   \]
   These inequalities can be rewritten as:
   \[
   f(x) \geq c g(x) \quad \text{and} \quad g(x) \geq c f(x) \quad \text{for all } x \in [0,1].

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> 5. **Evaluate the integral at the point \( a \):**
   Consider the given integral equation at \( x = a \):
   \[
   g(a) = \int_0^1 f(y) K(a, y) \, dy.
   \]
   Substitute \( f(y) = c g(y) \) into the integral:
   \[
   g(a) = \int_0^1 c g(y) K(a, y) \, dy = c \int_0^1 g(y) K(a, y) \, dy.
   \]
   Using the second given integral equation:
   \[
   \int_0^1 g(y) K(a, y) \, dy = f(a).
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   g(a) = c f(a).
   \]
   Since \( f(a) = c g(a) \), we have:
   \[
   g(a) = c (c g(a)) = c^2 g(a).
   \]
   Given that \( g(a) \neq 0 \) (since \( g(x) \) is positive), we can divide both sides by \( g(a) \):
   \[
   1 = c^2.
   \]
   Thus, \( c = 1 \) (since \( c \) is positive).</p>

2. Multiply both sides of the inequality by \(\cos(x)\), which is non-negative in the interval \([-\pi/2, \pi/2]\):
   \[
   \left(f''(x) - f(x)\right) \cdot \sin(x) + 2f'(x) \cos(x) \geq \cos(x).
   \]

3. Notice that the left-hand side can be rewritten using the product rule:
   \[
   \left(f(x) \sin(x) + \cos(x)\right)'' \geq 0.
   \]
   This implies that the function \( g(x) = f(x) \sin(x) + \cos(x) \) is convex on the interval \((- \pi/2, \pi/2)\).

4. Since \( g(x) \) is convex, we have:
   \[
   g(x_1) + g(x_2) \geq 2g\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\right).
   \]

5. Consider the integral:
   \[
   \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x) \sin(x) \, dx.
   \]

6. Using the definition of \( g(x) \), we can rewrite the integral:
   \[
   \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x) \sin(x) \, dx = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \left(g(x) - \cos(x)\right) \, dx.
   \]

7. Split the integral:
   \[
   \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \left(g(x) - \cos(x)\right) \, dx = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} g(x) \, dx - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) \, dx.
   \]

8. Evaluate the integral of \(\cos(x)\):
   \[
   \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) \, dx = 2.
   \]

9. Since \( g(x) \) is convex, we use the property of convex functions:
   \[
   \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} g(x) \, dx = 2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} g(x) \, dx.
   \]

10. By symmetry and convexity:
    \[
    \int_{0}^{\pi/2} g(x) \, dx \geq \int_{0}^{\pi/2} g(0) \, dx = \int_{0}^{\pi/2} 1 \, dx = \frac{\pi}{2}.
    \]

11. Therefore:
    \[
    \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} g(x) \, dx \geq \pi.
    \]

12. Combining the results:
    \[
    \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x) \sin(x) \, dx \geq \pi - 2.
    \]</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The entire solution demonstrates excellent logical sequencing. The solver progresses from the given inequality through a series of well-reasoned transformations, introducing the convex function g(x), decomposing the integral, establishing bounds, and finally arriving at the desired result.

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> **Define the function \( g(x) \):**
   Let \( g(x) = \sin(f(x)) \). 

**Differentiate \( g(x) \):**
   We need to find the first and second derivatives of \( g(x) \) with respect to \( x \):
   \[
   g'(x) = \cos(f(x)) f'(x)
   \]
   \[
   g''(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \cos(f(x)) f'(x) \right)

**Substitute \( g''(x) \) into the given inequality:**

   \[
   f''(x) \cos(f(x)) \geq (f'(x))^2 \sin(f(x))

   Substituting \( g''(x) \) from the previous step, we get:

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> 1. **Consider the space of real regular Borel measures on \(X\)**:
   - Let \(M(X)\) be the space of real regular Borel measures on \(X\). This space can be viewed as the dual space of \(C(X)\), the space of continuous real-valued functions on \(X\), with the weak-* topology.

2. **Define the action of \(T\) on measures**:
   - Define the action of \(T\) on a measure \(\mu \in M(X)\) by \(T\mu(A) = \mu(T^{-1}(A))\) for all Borel subsets \(A\) of \(X\). This defines a continuous map on the space of probability measures on \(X\).

3. **Use fixed point theory**:
   - The set of probability measures on \(X\) is a convex compact set in the weak-* topology. By the Banach-Alaoglu theorem, this set is compact. By the Schauder fixed-point theorem, there exists a probability measure \(\mu\) on \(X\) such that \(T\mu = \mu\). This means \(T\) is measure-preserving with respect to \(\mu\).

4. **Apply the Recurrence Theorem**:
   - By the Recurrence Theorem, for every Borel subset \(A\) of \(X\), the set \(S_A\) of those \(x \in A\) for which only finitely many of the points \(T^n(x)\), \(n \geq 1\), belong to \(A\) has measure zero.

5. **Construct a countable basis of open sets**:
   - Let \((U_n)_{n}\) be a countable basis of open sets for \(X\). Define \(S = \bigcup S_{U_n}\). Since \(S\) is a countable union of sets of measure zero, \(S\) itself has measure zero.

6. **Identify returning points**:
   - Every point \(x \in X \setminus S\) has the property that whenever \(x \in U\) (where \(U\) is an open subset of \(X\)), infinitely many of the points \(T^n(x)\) belong to \(U\). This implies that for such \(x\), there exists a strictly increasing sequence \(n_i\) such that \(\lim_{k \to \infty} T^{n_k}(x) = x\).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, any point \(x \in X \setminus S\) is a returning point, proving the existence of a returning point in \(X\).</p>

The solver begins by setting up the appropriate mathematical framework, establishes the existence of an invariant measure, applies recurrence theory, constructs necessary sets, and finally identifies the returning points.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer of 1.4 standard deviations indicates knowledge of probability distributions. Specifically, the solver knows that in a normal distribution, approximately 50% of data falls above the mean, so to capture at least 50% of all data, one would need to go a certain number of standard deviations below the mean. The value 1.4 is the correct distance that ensures at least 50% of data is included when measuring from the mean in one direction.</p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To arrive at the answer of 1.4, the solver must have applied knowledge of the standard normal distribution table or formula. This value corresponds to approximately 91.9% of data in one tail of a normal distribution, which means about 8.1% in the other tail. Since 50% + 41.9% = 91.9%, this ensures that at least 50% of the data is captured when going 1.4 standard deviations from the mean.</p>

   Let \( d_n \) be the metric on \( A_n \). We can assume \( d_n(x, y) \leq 1 \) for all \( x, y \in A_n \) by scaling the metrics if necessary. Define a new metric \( \overline{d_n} \) on \( A_n \) as follows:

   \overline{d_n}(x, y) = \sum_{m \ge n} 2^{n-m} d_m(x, y) \quad \forall x, y \in A_n.

We claim that $E_{i j}, i<j$, form a nilpotent 2-sided ideal $N$ (because the product of an upper triangular matrix with a strictly upper one is strictly upper). Then $N$ acts on $S$ by 0 (To see this, $N S$ is a submodule of $S$. It is proper because $N$ is nilpotent. Since $S$ is simple, we deduce that $N S=0$.) Note that the action of $E_{i i}$ commute with each other (and with the 0 -action by $E_{i j}$ ), thus they are module endomorphisms. By Schur's Lemma, $E_{i i}$ acts on $S$ as a scalar. Since $E_{i i} E_{j j}=0$ for $i \neq j$, at most one $E_{i i}$ acts as a non-zero scalar. Recall that $1=\sum_{i} E_{i i}$ acts by the identity. The claim follows.</p>

   1 - R_1 \sin(x + \theta_1) - R_2 \sin(2x + \theta_2) \geq 0

   The maximum value of \( \sin(x + \theta_1) \) and \( \sin(2x + \theta_2) \) is 1. Therefore:

   We claim that \( f_{|I} \) has a fixed point in \( I \). This can be shown using the fact that if a topological space is the union of two subsets \( U \) and \( V \) such that \(\bar{U} \cap V = U \cap \bar{V} = U \cap V = \{\text{a point}\}\), and if these two sets with the induced topology have the fixed point property, then their union (the original topological space) also has the fixed point property.</p>

For $1 < i < n$, $s_i(t+1) = 1$ if and only if exactly one of $s_{i-1}(t)$ and $s_{i+1}(t)$ is 1. This can be written as $s_i(t+1) = s_{i-1}(t) \oplus s_{i+1}(t)$, where $\oplus$ is the XOR operation.
For the end lamps:
$s_1(t+1) = 1$ if and only if $s_2(t) = 1$. So, $s_1(t+1) = s_2(t)$.

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> 4. **Consider the Target Redshift Range:**  To study dark energy and its influence on large-scale structures, we need to observe galaxies at a significant range of redshifts. Let's consider some realistic redshift ranges and the corresponding observed frequencies of the 21cm line:

    * **Low Redshift (z ~ 0.1-0.5):**  Observed frequency will be 1420 MHz / (1 + z). For z=0.1, it's ~1290 MHz. For z=0.5, it's ~947 MHz.
    * **Intermediate Redshift (z ~ 1-2):** For z=1, it's ~710 MHz. For z=2, it's ~473 MHz.
    * **Higher Redshift (z ~ 3-5):** For z=3, it's ~355 MHz. For z=5, it's ~237 MHz.

5. **Evaluate the Provided Frequency Ranges:** Now, let's examine each given frequency range and see if it captures the redshifted 21cm line for relevant redshifts:

    * **a) 500 - 700 MHz:** This range corresponds to redshifts of approximately 1 to 1.8 (1420/700 - 1 = 1.03) to 0.03 (1420/500 - 1 = 1.84). This looks promising for intermediate redshifts.

    * **b) 300 - 450 MHz:** This range corresponds to redshifts of approximately 3.7 to 2.1 (1420/300 - 1 = 3.73) to 2.16 (1420/450 - 1 = 2.15). This covers higher redshifts.

    * **c) 1 GHz - 1.2 GHz:** This range corresponds to redshifts of approximately 0.42 to 0.18 (1420/1200 - 1 = 0.18) to 0.18 (1420/1000 - 1 = 0.42). This covers lower redshifts.

    * **d) 20 - 80 MHz:**  This range corresponds to very high redshifts (1420/80 - 1 = 16.75 to 1420/20 - 1 = 70). While theoretically interesting for the very early universe, it's unlikely to be the *primary* focus for constraining dark energy using *galaxy* redshift surveys, as these galaxies would be extremely faint and difficult to detect. Furthermore, ionospheric effects become significant at these low frequencies.

    * **e) 100 - 400 MHz:** This range corresponds to redshifts of approximately 13.2 to 2.5 (1420/100 - 1 = 13.2) to 2.55 (1420/400 - 1 = 2.55).</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver systematically evaluates each frequency range option by calculating the corresponding redshift ranges and assessing their suitability for studying dark energy. This demonstrates a methodical approach where each option is analyzed using the same formula and criteria before making comparisons.</p>

The ionosphere significantly impacts observations at frequencies below ~100 MHz, making 'd' less ideal for a ground-based telescope focused on *galaxy* surveys (other experiments might target that range for different purposes, like the Epoch of Reionization).

8. **Final Selection:** Considering the redshift coverage and the practicalities of observing the 21cm line, the combinations that provide a good range of redshifts are **a and e**, and **a and c**. Between these two, **a and e** provide a slightly higher redshift reach, allowing for observation of dark energy's influence at earlier times. However, the answer choices provided don't include 'a and c'. Therefore, the best fit from the given choices is **(B) a, e**.</p>

    * For a given length `n`, strings in `S` have the form `1^i \# x` where `i <= k` and `|x| = n - i - 1` (assuming the `#` has length 1).
    * Since each `S_i` is sparse, there exists a polynomial `p_i(m)` such that `|S_i^{=m}| <= p_i(m)`.
    * For a fixed `i`, the number of strings of length `n` in `S` with the prefix `1^i \#` is at most the number of strings of length `n - i - 1` in `S_i`, which is bounded by `p_i(n - i - 1)`.
    * The total number of strings of length `n` in `S` is the sum over all `i` from 1 to `k` of `|{ 1^i \# x | x \in S_i, |1^i \# x| = n }|`. This is equal to the sum of `|S_i^{=n-i-1}|` for valid `i`. Since each `p_i` is a polynomial, their sum is also a polynomial.</p>

The pair $(R_1 \cup R_2, C_1 \cap C_2)$ is a saddle pair.
By minimality of $(R_1, C_1)$, since $R_1 \subseteq R_1 \cup R_2$ and $C_1 \cap C_2 \subseteq C_1$, we have $R_1 \cup R_2 = R_1$ and $C_1 \cap C_2 = C_1$.

From $C_1 \cap C_2 = C_1$, we have $C_1 \subseteq C_2$.

This gives $y = 2 - x^2$ and $xy = -1$, leading to $x^3 - 2x - 1 = 0$, with solutions for $x$ and corresponding $y$ as found in the $m=0$ case.</p>

   $B_1 \cap B_2$ is Lebesgue-measurable and contains x.

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> Let the input image size be $H_{in} \times W_{in} \times C_{in}$, where $H_{in}$ is the height, $W_{in}$ is the width, and $C_{in}$ is the number of input channels.
In this case, $H_{in} = 32$, $W_{in} = 32$, and $C_{in} = 1$.

Let the parameters of the convolutional layer be:
- Number of filters: $N_f$
- Filter size: $F \times F$
- Stride: $S$
- Padding: $P$

In this case, $N_f = 4$, $F = 5$, $S = 2$, and $P = 1$.

The size of each filter is $F \times F \times C_{in}$.
In this case, the size of each filter is $5 \times 5 \times 1 = 25$.

The number of weights for a single filter is $F \times F \times C_{in}$.
The number of weights for all filters is $N_f \times F \times F \times C_{in}$.
In this case, the number of weights for all filters is $4 \times 5 \times 5 \times 1 = 100$.

Each filter also has a bias term. The number of biases is equal to the number of filters, $N_f$.
In this case, the number of biases is 4.

The total number of trainable parameters in the first layer is the number of weights plus the number of biases.
Total trainable parameters = $(N_f \times F \times F \times C_{in}) + N_f$.
In this case, total trainable parameters = $(4 \times 5 \times 5 \times 1) + 4 = 100 + 4 = 104$.

However, the question asks for the total number of weights defined for the entire activation output of this first layer. This is asking for the number of weights in the filters themselves, not including the bias terms, and not the size of the activation map.

The number of weights in a single filter is $F \times F \times C_{in} = 5 \times 5 \times 1 = 25$.
Since there are 4 filters, the total number of weights is the number of weights per filter multiplied by the number of filters.
Total number of weights = (Number of filters) $\times$ (Filter size) $\times$ (Number of input channels)
Total number of weights = $N_f \times F \times F \times C_{in}$
Total number of weights = $4 \times 5 \times 5 \times 1 = 100$.

The question is slightly ambiguous as "activation output" could refer to the output feature map. Let's confirm the interpretation of the question. "total number of weights defined for the entire activation output" likely refers to the weights of the filters that produce this activation output.

Let's calculate the size of the output activation map.
The formula for the output height $H_{out}$ and width $W_{out}$ of a convolutional layer is:
$H_{out} = \lfloor \frac{H_{in} - F + 2P}{S} \rfloor + 1$
$W_{out} = \lfloor \frac{W_{in} - F + 2P}{S} \rfloor + 1$

In this case:
$H_{out} = \lfloor \frac{32 - 5 + 2 \times 1}{2} \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor \frac{32 - 5 + 2}{2} \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor \frac{29}{2} \rfloor + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15$
$W_{out} = \lfloor \frac{32 - 5 + 2 \times 1}{2} \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor \frac{32 - 5 + 2}{2} \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor \frac{29}{2} \rfloor + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15$

The number of output channels is equal to the number of filters, $N_f = 4$.
So the output activation map size is $15 \times 15 \times 4$.

The question asks for the "total number of weights defined for the entire activation output". This phrasing suggests the weights of the filters themselves. If the question meant the total number of values in the activation output, it would be $15 \times 15 \times 4 = 900$.

Given the phrasing "total number of weights defined for the entire activation output", it most likely refers to the weights of the filters that are responsible for generating this output. Each filter has a set of weights.

Number of weights in one filter = $5 \times 5 \times 1 = 25$.
Number of filters = 4.
Total number of weights = Number of filters $\times$ Number of weights per filter = $4 \times 25 = 100$.</p>

The sum of the entries of a matrix is the sum of all its elements.

First, let's find the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{M}.$ The characteristic polynomial is
\begin{align*} \det(\mathbf{M} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) &= \det \begin{pmatrix} -\omega^2 - \lambda & - \omega \\ 1 & - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \\ &= (-\omega^2 - \lambda)(-\lambda) - (-\omega)(1) \\ &= \lambda \omega^2 + \lambda^2 + \omega \\ &= \lambda^2 + \omega^2 \lambda + \omega \end{align*}</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver begins by attempting to find the eigenvalues of M through the characteristic polynomial. This demonstrates knowledge of advanced linear algebra techniques for analyzing matrix properties.</p>

The statement says that observing the state of one of the electrons *will* affect the state of the other. This is true for entangled states. Let's check if Y is entangled. If Y can be written as a product of two single-electron states, it's separable, not entangled.
Y = 1/2(|uu> - |ud> + |du> - |dd>)
This can be written as 1/2 (|u>(|u>-|d>) + |d>(|u>-|d>)) = 1/2 (|u>+|d>)(|u>-|d>).

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> For $p=5$:
$n_5 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, so $n_5 = 1, 6, 11, \dots$
$n_5$ divides $\frac{1645}{5} = 329 = 7 \cdot 47$.
The divisors of $329$ are $1, 7, 47, 329$.
The possible values of $n_5$ are $1$.
So, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, denoted by $P_5$.
Since $P_5$ is unique, it is normal in $G$.
$|P_5| = 5$.

$h(n) = \frac{27^n}{n^n} = \frac{(3^3)^n}{n^n} = \frac{3^{3n}}{n^n}$.

Let's analyze the behavior of $h(n)$.
$\frac{h(n+1)}{h(n)} = \frac{3^{3(n+1)} / (n+1)^{n+1}}{3^{3n} / n^n} = \frac{3^{3n+3}}{3^{3n}} \cdot \frac{n^n}{(n+1)^{n+1}} = 3^3 \cdot \frac{n^n}{(n+1)^n (n+1)} = 27 \left( \frac{n}{n+1} \right)^n \frac{1}{n+1}$
$= \frac{27}{n+1} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n+1} \right)^n$.

As $n \to \infty$, $\left( 1 - \frac{1}{n+1} \right)^n \to e^{-1}$.
So, $\frac{h(n+1)}{h(n)} \approx \frac{27}{n+1} e^{-1} = \frac{27}{e(n+1)}$.

Case 1: $x > 0$. We close the contour in the upper half-plane. The contour consists of the real axis from $-R$ to $R$ and a semicircle in the upper half-plane with radius $R$. As $R \to \infty$, the integral over the semicircle goes to zero by Jordan's lemma, since the exponent is $2 \pi \mathrm{i} (t+iy) x = 2 \pi \mathrm{i} t x - 2 \pi y x$, and the factor $e^{-2 \pi y x}$ goes to zero as $y \to \infty$ for $x > 0$.</p>

    * Group 1 and 2 (Li, Be):  Their hydrides are reactive, but their other compounds with other light elements might fit. However, Li and Be compounds tend to be solids at room temperature.
    * Group 13 and 14 (B, C):  Boron compounds are interesting, but their hydrides and oxides don't readily fit the molar mass.

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> **1. Understanding the Core Concept: Microlensing**

* **What it is:** Microlensing occurs when a massive object (the lens) passes between an observer and a distant light source (the source). The gravity of the lens bends the light from the source, causing it to appear brighter and sometimes create multiple images.
* **Key parameters:**  The strength of the lensing effect depends on the mass of the lens. The duration of the event depends on the relative velocities of the lens, source, and observer, as well as the lens mass.

**2. Focusing on "Very Massive Black Holes"**

* **Impact of high mass:**  Very massive black holes (VMBHs) will have a stronger gravitational field, leading to larger lensing effects (greater magnification, wider separation of potential images, though these are rarely resolvable in microlensing). They will also cause longer duration events because the "Einstein radius" (the region where significant lensing occurs) is larger.</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This span demonstrates domain-specific knowledge application as the solver applies specialized knowledge from astrophysics about gravitational lensing, black holes, and observational astronomy.

    * **(A) Filling voids:**  This explanation is physically improbable. Organic molecules on a TLC plate are a surface phenomenon, not filling the entire matrix to prevent excitation. Also, "persistent luminescence" isn't the primary mechanism at play here – it's fluorescence.

    * **(B) Non-radiative energy transfer:** This is a plausible mechanism. If the organic compound can accept energy from the excited zinc silicate and dissipate it as heat or vibrations, the zinc silicate won't emit light. The statement that the organic compound *also* returns to the ground state non-radiatively reinforces this idea.

    * **(C) Absorbance at 254nm:** This is another highly plausible mechanism. If the organic compound absorbs the excitation light (254nm), less light reaches the zinc silicate, leading to less luminescence. This is a common way organic compounds are visualized on TLC plates.

    * **(D) Competing fluorescence:** While some organic compounds *do* fluoresce, the description implies the *primary* effect is a *dark* spot, meaning a reduction in the overall light emitted. If the organic compound was fluorescing brightly, you might see a spot of *different* color or intensity, not necessarily a dark one. The phrasing "lower intensity and a shorter emission wavelength" weakens this option, as the observation is a *dark* spot, indicating a lack of light, not just a different color of light.</p>

The problem asks for the smallest integer $p$ such that the sequence $s_1, s_2, \ldots$ must be periodic after a certain point, and its period is at most $p$. This means $p$ is the maximum possible value of the least common multiple of the lengths of the cycles in the functional graph of $f$, where $f$ is a function from $S$ to $S$.</p>

Let the adjacent pair be $(K_i, K_{i+1})$, where the indices are taken modulo 25.
We need to choose a third knight such that this third knight is not adjacent to the chosen pair.

Consider an adjacent pair of knights. The number of such pairs is 25.
Once a pair of adjacent knights is chosen, say $(K_1, K_2)$, we need to choose a third knight from the remaining $25 - 2 = 23$ knights.
The third knight cannot be $K_{25}$ (adjacent to $K_1$) or $K_3$ (adjacent to $K_2$).
So, the third knight can be any of the $23 - 2 = 21$ remaining knights.
Number of ways to choose a pair of adjacent knights is 25.
For each such pair, there are 21 choices for the third knight such that exactly two are adjacent.

    * **(A) antibody part is at 3', and the signaling part is at 5' of the transforming vector:**
        * **Key Concept:**  Gene directionality (5' to 3' is the direction of transcription and translation). The antibody part (scFv) is encoded by a specific DNA sequence, and the signaling part is encoded by another.
        * **Reasoning:** The order of the CAR construct *in the protein* is scFv (N-terminus) -> transmembrane -> spacer -> signaling (C-terminus). The DNA encoding this must be in the same 5' to 3' order. Therefore, the antibody part's gene would be upstream (closer to the 5' end) of the signaling part's gene. This statement is incorrect.

    * **(B) your variable moiety recognizes multiple epitopes:**
        * **Key Concept:** "Variable moiety" refers to the scFv, and "monospecific" was explicitly stated in the prompt. "Epitope" is the specific part of an antigen the antibody binds to.
        * **Reasoning:** The prompt states the scFv is *monospecific*. "Mono" means one. Therefore, it recognizes *one* specific epitope. This statement is incorrect.

    * **(C) regulatory T cells are involved in tumor elimination:**
        * **Key Concept:**  CAR T-cell therapy utilizes cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) typically *suppress* immune responses, including anti-tumor responses.
        * **Reasoning:** The therapy uses CD8+ T cells, which are the direct killers of tumor cells. While Tregs can be present in the tumor microenvironment and *hinder* anti-tumor responses, they are not the primary effector cells in this *CAR T-cell therapy* setup designed to eliminate the tumor. This statement is likely incorrect in the context of *how the therapy is designed to work*.

    * **(D) tumor antigens are transported through the Golgi:**
        * **Key Concept:**  Antigens need to be presented on the cell surface to be recognized by T cells. The Golgi apparatus plays a crucial role in protein processing and trafficking, including cell surface proteins.
        * **Reasoning:**  For the CAR T-cells to recognize the tumor antigens, those antigens need to be on the surface of the tumor cells. Many cell surface proteins, including those that can become tumor antigens, are processed and trafficked to the cell membrane via the Golgi. This statement is likely correct.</p>

We want $P(|X - \mu| \leq k\sigma) \geq 0.5$.
We know that $P(|X - \mu| \leq k\sigma) = 1 - P(|X - \mu| \geq k\sigma)$.
So, we want $1 - P(|X - \mu| \geq k\sigma) \geq 0.5$.
This means $P(|X - \mu| \geq k\sigma) \leq 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.
From Chebyshev's inequality, we have $P(|X - \mu| \geq k\sigma) \leq 1/k^2$.
So, if we set $1/k^2 = 0.5$, we get $k^2 = 1/0.5 = 2$, which means $k = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414$.</p>

Since each $A_n$ is metrizable, it has a countable basis for its topology. Let $\mathcal{B}_n$ be a countable basis for the topology of $A_n$.
The topology on $A_n$ is the subspace topology inherited from K. Therefore, every element $B \in \mathcal{B}_n$ is of the form $U \cap A_n$ for some open set $U$ in K.

Consider the collection $\mathcal{B} = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty \mathcal{B}_n$. Since each $\mathcal{B}_n$ is countable, and the union is over a countable index set, $\mathcal{B}$ is a countable collection of subsets of K.</p>

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> We will show that $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for the topology of K. Let $W$ be an arbitrary open set in K, and let $x$ be an arbitrary point in $W$. Since $K = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty A_n$, there exists some index $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x \in A_m$.

Since $W$ is open in K, the intersection $W \cap A_m$ is an open set in the subspace topology of $A_m$. Since $\mathcal{B}_m$ is a basis for the topology of $A_m$, and $x \in W \cap A_m$, there exists an element $B \in \mathcal{B}_m$ such that $x \in B \subseteq W \cap A_m$.

Since $B \in \mathcal{B}_m$, it follows that $B \in \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty \mathcal{B}_n = \mathcal{B}$.
We have $x \in B$ and $B \subseteq W \cap A_m$. Since $W \cap A_m \subseteq W$, we have $B \subseteq W$.
Thus, for every open set $W$ in K and every point $x \in W$, there exists an element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B \subseteq W$. This shows that $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for the topology of K.

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> We need to calculate $\cos 18^\circ$.
Let $\theta = 18^\circ$, then $5\theta = 90^\circ$.
$2\theta = 36^\circ$, $3\theta = 54^\circ$.
$2\theta + 3\theta = 90^\circ$.
$\sin(2\theta) = \sin(90^\circ - 3\theta) = \cos(3\theta)$.
$2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta$.
Since $\cos \theta \neq 0$, we can divide by $\cos \theta$:
$2 \sin \theta = 4 \cos^2 \theta - 3 = 4(1 - \sin^2 \theta) - 3 = 4 - 4 \sin^2 \theta - 3 = 1 - 4 \sin^2 \theta$.
$4 \sin^2 \theta + 2 \sin \theta - 1 = 0$.

Let $x = \sin \theta$. $4x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0$.
$x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4(4)(-1)}}{8} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 16}}{8} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{20}}{8} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{4}$.
Since $\sin 18^\circ > 0$, $\sin 18^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4}$.

$\cos^2 18^\circ = 1 - \sin^2 18^\circ = 1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{5 + 1 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16} = 1 - \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16} = 1 - \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{8 - 3 + \sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{8}$.</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver employs advanced trigonometric techniques to find the exact value of cos(18°). This involves using angle addition formulas, trigonometric identities, and solving a quadratic equation to express sin(18°) in terms of radicals, then using the Pythagorean identity to find cos²(18°).</p>

Let me factor H out:

Divide both sides by H (assuming H ≠ 0):

(x + 175)(1 - 125/(75 + x)) = 125

Simplify the term in parentheses:

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> Let me start by considering small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

Case n = 1. If there's only one lamp, it has no neighbors. Wait, hold on, the problem says "the two lamps at the ends have one neighbor each". But when n=1, the single lamp is both ends, so does it have zero neighbors or one? Wait, the problem statement says "the two lamps at the ends have one neighbor each", but when n=1, there's only one lamp. Let me check.

Hmm, the problem says, "the two lamps at the ends have one neighbor each". But if n=1, maybe that single lamp is considered to have no neighbors? Wait, the original problem says "n ≥ 1". So maybe when n=1, it's a line with a single lamp. In that case, since it's at the "end", it has one neighbor. Wait, but if it's the only lamp, there can't be any neighbor. There's a contradiction here.</p>

As long as the encoding is such that from the string s, we can recover i and x, but actually, the machine just needs to compute s from i and x, not the other way.

Wait, but the problem doesn't say that k is given as part of the input. Wait, the input is <x, i>, so i is part of the input, which can be written in binary, and assuming that the input i is between 1 and k.

Wait, but how does S know about k? Because in the problem statement, given S_1,...,S_k (finite k), we need to build S. If the question is for fixed k, then it's manageable. If k is part of the input, that is, the problem is parameterized by k, then we might need to handle variable k.</p>

They consider how the machine would encode inputs, make queries, and interpret results.

Wait, 2 is a losing position, so if first player moves from 3 by taking 1, leaving 2 (a losing position), then second player can't win. That would mean n=3 is a winning position. But wait, maybe my terminology is confused. Let me clarify:

In normal play convention, a position is losing if every move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Winning position if there's at least one move leading to a losing position for the opponent.

So starting from n=0: losing.

n=1: from 1, you can move to 0 (losing). Therefore, n=1 is winning.

n=2: from 2, you can move to 2-1=1 (which is a winning position for opponent). So all moves from 2 lead to opponent's winning positions. Therefore, n=2 is losing.</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver is using recursive reasoning by defining the status of each position in terms of the positions that can be reached from it. They recognize that a position is winning if and only if the player can move to a losing position, and losing if and only if all moves lead to winning positions for the opponent. This recursive definition allows them to build up from the base case.</p>

The integral is from x = 1 to x = 1/ν of dx over sqrt( (x2 -1)(1 - ν2x2) ). Let me set a substitution so that the upper limit becomes fixed. For example, let's let t = νx. Then when x = 1/ν, t = 1, and when x =1, t= ν.

But then x = t/ν, dx = dt/ν. Let's plug in:

On the other hand, at k=1 (which would correspond nu=0), but nu is in(0,1), so k=1 is at the limit. As k approaches1, E(k) approaches1, and K(k) approaches infinity. So for fixed k approaching1, E(k) remains about1, whereas (1 -k2) K(k) approaches0 * infty, which is more nuanced.</p>

For n >=1:

n is W if there exists a square number s <=n such that n - s is L.

n is L otherwise.

Let's compute step by step:

n=0: L

n=1: Check n - 1=0. Since 0 is L, so n=1 is W.

n=2: Check n -1=1 (W). Therefore, n=2 is L.

n=3: n -1=2 (L). So n=3 is W.

We need to find (Sum) mod83= [ (78*79/2)^2 ] mod83. Let's compute this step by step.

First compute 78 mod83=78, 79 mod83=79. Then 78*79= (78*80 -78)=6240 -78=6162. Divided by2:6162/2=3081. Now, 3081 mod83.

Compute 83*37=3071. 3081-3071=10. So 3081≡10 mod83. Then, square it:10^2=100. 100 mod83=17.

This geometric interpretation provides intuition about how the matrix behaves when raised to powers.</p>

But C is contained in ∁U. However, ∁U is closed. So V would need to be open, contain C, and be in ∁U.  So take V = interior of ∁U, which is open and is the largest open set contained in ∁U. If C iscontained in V= int(∁U), then we can take V and U as separating open sets.

To see whether C is contained in int(∁U), observe that points in C might or might not be density points of ∁U. Let's be detailed.</p>

They start with a claim, then systematically build a logical argument by defining variables, establishing relationships, and reasoning about computational complexity to reach the conclusion. The proof follows standard mathematical reasoning patterns with clear logical connections between statements.</p>

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> Conversely, P ⊆ P_bad-angel because we can ignore the angel string (set α_n to some fixed string, which can be computed trivially). Therefore, P = P_bad-angel.

Regarding NP: If NP = P_bad-angel? Well, NP is different. In the angel model, you have this poly-length string that can depend on n, but here, since it's computable in poly-time, there's no nondeterminism. Since the angel string is computable in poly-time, then the advice doesn't give any additional power beyond P. But NP is a class that includes problems verifiable in poly-time with a certificate, which can vary with the input. In this case, since the angel string is fixed for each input length, and computed deterministically, it's like a P machine.</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver analyzes complexity classes by examining their fundamental definitions and properties.

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> But storing α_n as a string would require S_L to have one string of length p(n) for each n. If p(n) is a polynomial, for m = p(n), that corresponds to one string of length m per n equal to p^{-1}(m). However, if p is invertible (polynomial and strictly increasing), then for each m, there may be at most one n s.t. p(n) = m. Hence, in that case, S_L would be sparse. For example, if p(n) = n^k, then for each m, n is m^{1/k}, which may not be integer, so for m which is a perfect kth power, there's n, otherwise not. So for S_L = { α_n | n ∈ N }, each string is of length p(n), hence the number of strings of length m is 0 or 1.</p>

**Problem 1:** Given k sparse sets S_1, S_2, ..., S_k, we need to construct a single sparse set S and a poly-time TM M with oracle access to S such that M can decide whether x is in S_i given <x,i> as input.

Hmm. Each S_i is sparse, so for each length n, each S_i has at most p(n) strings of length n.</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver breaks down the complex multi-part problem into separate components, starting with Problem 1. They further decompose this problem by first understanding what it means for each S_i to be sparse, then considering how to combine these sets while preserving sparsity, and finally how to design an oracle machine that can use this combined set.</p>

The class P/poly is equivalent to languages decidable by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-length advice string, which can be arbitrary. It is known that P/poly contains undecidable languages (as the advice can be uncomputable), but when the advice is computable in poly-time (as in P_bad-angel), it's equal to P.

In our case, the problem wants to show that L ∈ P_angel implies that L is decidable by a poly-time machine with a sparse oracle S_L. It is a standard result in complexity theory that P/poly is exactly the class of languages decidable by a polynomial-time machine with a sparse oracle.</p>

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> I think I'm going in circles here. Given the time constraints, maybe for problem 3, since it's known in complexity theory that P/poly is equivalent to having a polynomial-time machine with a sparse oracle, and P_angel is basically P/poly, so the answer is invoking this theorem. Thus, the existence of such a sparse set S_L follows from the definition of P/poly.

Therefore, for the first problem, combining multiple sparse sets into one via tagging. For problem 2, P_bad-angel equals P, and NP doesn't unless NP=P. Problem 3 is about reducing P_angel (which is P/poly) to polynomial-time with a sparse oracle, which is standard.</p>

The Grundy number for n is mex{Grundy(n - s) | s is a square, s<=n}.

So let's compute the Grundy numbers:

Inductive step: Assume we have the first k losing positions n1,...,nk. To construct n_{k+1} >nk such that from n_{k+1}, subtracting any square lands in an N-position (that is, not equal to some n_i).

Alternatively, if from the set S={n1,n2,...,nk} we can ensure that there are infinitely many numbers n not in S and which are such that all n -s^2 are not in S.

That would require S to be such that all n > some number are either in S or can reach S by subtracting a square. Which contradicts; in reality, to build S as a mutually unreachable set by square moves.

Given that squares grow quadratically, after some point, between consecutive squares, there's increasing gaps.

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> Alternatively, exploit the concept that for every number m, you can reach at most sqrt(m) numbers by subtracting squares.

If the required set S is built, say, recursively. Given that there are infinitely many numbers, and for each number you add to S, you must exclude only finitely many others (i.e., n +s^2) for future inclusion. Since each time you adjoin n to S, you exclude numbers n + s^2 for all squares s. The number of excluded numbers per step is about sqrt(n) per n. Adding up sqrt(n) over n from 1 to infinity converges. Hence, the total number of excluded numbers is bounded, and thus there are infinitely many left. Therefore, an infinite sequence exists.

This is an application of the Schur's theorem idea, ormore narrowly, Inifinite. Inclusion-Exclusion. Since each existing P-position n exclude as posible future positions all n+s^2 for some s.</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver uses sophisticated mathematical reasoning about the density of squares to argue that an infinite set of losing positions must exist. They recognize that squares grow at a rate of sqrt(n), which means that when constructing a set where no two elements differ by a square, each element added only excludes a relatively small number of potential future elements. This density-based argument is a powerful technique in combinatorial number theory.</p>

= [ E(k) - (1 -k2)K(k) ] / (k(1 -k2)) * ( -nu / k )

Simplify:

First, let's express 1 -k2. Since k = sqrt(1 - nu2), 1 -k2 = nu2.

Therefore:

f'(nu) = [ E(k) - nu2 K(k) ] / (k * (nu2) ) * ( - nu /k )</p>

The solver carefully tracks how the derivative propagates through this composition, correctly computing dk/dnu = -nu/k and then multiplying by the known formula for dK/dk.

[ E(k) - nu2 K(k) ] =E(k) - (1 -k2) K(k) since 1 -k2=nu2. Wait, no. Hold on. Wait:

 From earlier, the expression:

E(k) - nu2 K(k) = E(k) - (1 -k2) K(k). But since nu2 =1 -k2. Therefore, E(k) - nu2 K(k)= E(k) - (1 -k2)K(k). Which we have already stated is positive for all0<k <1. Thus, in our expression:

f'(nu)= - [E(k)- (1 -k2) K(k) ] / ( (1 -nu2)nu )= - [positive] / [ (1 -nu2)nu )

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver generates a hypothesis about why the milk levels differ, considering the implications of the handle being plugged and testing whether this means the handle is completely separated from the main jug or just partially blocked.</p>

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> Because even though the handle has a higher milk level, the pressure at the bottom must balance. Therefore, the pressure from the main jug's column plus atmospheric equals the pressure from the handle's column plus the trapped air pressure. But gauge pressure subtracts atmospheric, so in gauge pressure, the handle's trapped air's pressure would be P_handle - atmospheric, which equals rho*g*(h - H). So when we compute the gauge pressure at the bottom from the handle side, it would be rho*g*H + (P_handle - atmospheric) = rho*g*H + rho*g*(h - H) = rho*g*h.</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver uses logical reasoning to deduce that the pressures must balance at the bottom, then systematically works through the implications to calculate the gauge pressure, showing strong deductive reasoning skills.</p>

Since it's an infinite sum, maybe it telescopes? If that's the case, then we need to find a way to express b_n/a_{n+1} or something similar as a telescoping series. Let me see.

Telescoping series typically require that consecutive terms cancel each other out. The given term is b_n (1/a_{n+1} - 1/a_{n+3}) so each term would be b_n / a_{n+1} - b_n / a_{n+3}. If this sum telescopes, the negative part of one term might cancel the positive part of a later term.</p>

Another angle: Maybe it's a box on a horizontal surface with an initial velocity v0, subject to a position-dependent force. But with friction. Suppose after starting to move, the box experiences kinetic friction. The kinetic friction force is μk * normal force. Since it's on a horizontal surface, normal force is mg.

So, frictional force is μk mg opposite to the motion. So acceleration is -μk g? But that's constant. But then the acceleration wouldn't depend on x, t, or others unless there's another force.</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver systematically tests a hypothesis (that only kinetic friction is acting) and eliminates it because the resulting acceleration would be constant and not depend on x or t, which contradicts the problem requirements.</p>

Let me see:

Diisopropyl ketone reacting with dimethylamine under acidic conditions would form an enamine via:

1. Protonation of carbonyl oxygen.

2. Nucleophilic attack by dimethylamine (HN(CH3)2) at the carbonyl carbon, forming a hemiaminal ( alcohol ammonium ion).

3. Protonation of the hydroxyl group, making it a better leaving group.

We have five sets, each with one element. But adjacent sets must be disjoint. So, we can arrange them in a cycle, but each adjacent set has different elements. For five sets arranged in a cycle, each adjacent pair must have unique elements. The minimal number of elements required for a 5-cycle is 3 because in graph coloring, the chromatic number for a 5-cycle is 3, so you can color the sets with 3 elements such that no two adjacent sets share the same element. So, in this case, n_1=3, which coincides with ceiling(5*1/2)=3 (since 5/2=2.5, ceiling is 3). So works here.</p>

For the determinant of \( M_1 \):

Row 1: 1, \( \sin\theta \), 1

Row 2: \( -\sin\theta \), 1, \( \sin\theta \)

Let me expand along the first row.

det(M1) = 1 * det(minor(1,1)) - sinθ * det(minor(1,2)) + 1 * det(minor(1,3))

Minor(1,1) is the submatrix when we remove row 1 and column 1:

[1, sinθ; -sinθ, 1]

So its determinant is (1)(1) - (-sinθ)(sinθ) = 1 + sin2θ

Minor(1,2) is the submatrix removing row 1 and column 2:

[-sinθ, sinθ; -1, 1]

Determinant: (-sinθ)(1) - (sinθ)(-1) = -sinθ + sinθ = 0

Minor(1,3) is removing row 1 and column 3:

[-sinθ, 1; -1, -sinθ]

Determinant: (-sinθ)(-sinθ) - (1)(-1) = sin2θ + 1

Therefore, det(M1) = 1*(1 + sin2θ) - sinθ*0 + 1*(1 + sin2θ) = (1 + sin2θ) + (1 + sin2θ) = 2(1 + sin2θ)</p>

cos(θ - π/4) = cosθ cos(π/4) + sinθ sin(π/4) = (cosθ + sinθ)/√2

Thus, substituting:

cos(a) = (cosθ - sinθ)/√2

sin(a) = (sinθ + cosθ)/√2

sin(b) = (sinθ - cosθ)/√2

cos(b) = (cosθ + sinθ)/√2</p>

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> For a martingale, we need that the next term is the conditional expectation given the past. Let's check for Y_k. Each Y_{k+1} is the conditional expectation of X given σ(A, Z0, ..., Z_k). But the σ-algebra here is increasing because each time we add a new Z variable. So, the σ-algebras σ(A, Z0, ..., Z_{k}) are increasing in k. Therefore, the sequence Y_k is a martingale with respect to the filtration G_k = σ(A, Z0, ..., Z_{k-1}). Wait, because Y_k is measurable with respect to G_k = σ(A, Z0, ..., Z_{k−1}), and Y_{k+1} is the conditional expectation of X given G_{k+1} = σ(A, Z0, ..., Z_k). Therefore, the tower property gives that E[Y_{k+1} | G_k] = E[E[X | G_{k+1}] | G_k] = E[X | G_k] = Y_k. So yes, {Y_k} is a martingale with respect to the filtration {G_k}.</p>

Therefore, both {Y_k} and {Z_k} are martingales. Since X is integrable, and conditional expectations are L1 contractions, all Y_k and Z_k are integrable. Now, the martingale convergence theorem says that if a martingale is L1-bounded, then it converges almost surely and in L1 to some limit. But in our case, since the filtrations are increasing, do we know that they are L1-bounded? Well, each Y_k is E[X | G_k], so by Jensen's inequality, ||Y_k||1 ≤ ||X||1. Similarly for Z_k. Therefore, both sequences are uniformly integrable (since conditional expectations are uniformly integrable if the original variable is integrable). So by the martingale convergence theorem, they converge both almost surely and in L1 to Y_∞ and Z_∞ respectively.</p>

Wait the problem states: You are given integrable random variables X, Y0 and Z0 on the same probability space (Ω, F, P). So Y0 and Z0 are arbitrary integrable random variables, and then recursively define Yk and Zk based on previous ones. Hmm. Wait, now I reread the problem:

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> First, I need to remember how microlensing works. From what I recall, microlensing is a method used to detect objects like black holes or other massive objects that don't emit light themselves. It relies on the gravitational effect of the object passing in front of a background star or galaxy. The gravity of the massive object bends the light from the background source, acting like a lens, which brightens the observed light temporarily. The key here is that microlensing doesn't depend on the emitted light from the lensing object, so it can detect dark objects.</p>

If the lens is a very massive black hole, the event duration could be on the order of months or years, I think.</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver is analyzing the relationship between mass, Einstein ring radius, and event duration.

From earlier, the tension at position x is:

T(x) = ( (m/2 + M) ω2 r ) - (m ω2 x2)/(2r )

But also, when x=0, T(0) should equal the total centripetal force:

Hmm. Wait, that's assuming c=1, so x = v t, speed v, so v is in units where c=1. Then, the light travel time is x/t = v, but wait, no. Light's speed is c=1, so time taken is distance divided by speed. Distance is x = v γ τ, so the light takes time t_light = x / c = v γ τ. Therefore, t0 = t - t_light = γ τ - v γ τ = γ τ (1 - v).</p>

The key point mentioned is that at radius r3, which is much smaller than r0, the gas becomes opaque to heat radiation. Hmm, so before r3, the gas is transparent, and after that, it's opaque. That probably means that once the gas reaches r3, it stops radiating heat because the heat can't escape anymore, right?

Square plates with side length 1m: when they are placed a distance 30 cm apart, and their centers at (-15 cm, 0,0) and (15 cm, 0,0), then they must be parallel to each other. Since their centers are separated along the x-axis, they must be oriented perpendicular to the x-axis. Therefore, each plate lies in a y-z plane at x = -0.15 and x = +0.15. Therefore, the coordinates for each plate would be:

Left plate: x = -0.15 m, with y ranging from -0.5 m to +0.5 m, and z ranging from -0.5 m to +0.5 m.

Right plate: x = +0.15 m, same y and z ranges.</p>

                        <p><strong>Text:</strong> But, wait. Wait. Hmm. Let's verify. For example, in the formula for cos^6 theta, when theta=90°, would the expression there equate zero?

Indeed, using the formula:

\[\cos^6 \theta = \frac{5}{16} + \frac{15}{32} \cos 2\theta + \frac{3}{16} \cos4\theta + \frac{1}{32} \cos6\theta.\]

At theta=90°:

cos^6 90°=0=5/16 + 15/32*(-1) + 3/16*(1) +1/32*(-1). Let's compute:

5/16=10/32

Then 15/32*(-1)= -15/32

3/16=6/32*1=6/32

1/32*(-1)= -1/32=> total is 10/32 -15/32 +6/32 -1/32=(10 -15+6 -1)/32=(0)/32=0. Which is correct.</p>

First, since the rod is moving, the charges in the rod are moving, so there is a current. The rod is insulating, so the charges can't flow through the material, but since it's moving as a whole, the charge density is moving, so that would create a current.

The power delivered is force times velocity. The force on the rod due to the external E field is F = ρ * E * volume. Wait, force per unit volume is ρ E. Therefore, total force is ρ E V, where V is the volume. Then the power is F * v = ρ E V v.

But actually, per unit volume, it's ρ E v, and power per unit length would be ρ E v π R2, since volume per unit length is π R2. Therefore, total power (per unit length) P = ρ E v π R2.</p>

So, consider the surface of the cylinder (r = R). The Poynting vector there (r = R) is S = - (E ρ v R)/2 r̂ + (ρ2 v R2 )/(4 ε0 ) ẑ

Thus, when taking the dot product with dA (which is outward normal, so radial), the axial component of S doesn't contribute. Only the radial component contributes. So the power flux is:

∫ S · dA = ∫ [ - (E ρ v R)/2 r̂ ] · (r̂ dA ) = - (E ρ v R)/2 ∫ dA over the cylindrical surface.

But wait, the surface area per unit length is 2π R * 1 (for unit length), so ∫ dA per unit length is 2π R. Therefore, ∫ S · dA per unit length is - (E ρ v R)/2 * 2π R = - E ρ v π R2.</p>

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the angle between each successive polarizer is 18 degrees. So the first polarizer is at 18 degrees from vertical. Then the light coming out of the first polarizer is polarized at 18 degrees. The second polarizer is at 36 degrees, so the angle between the first and second is 18 degrees.</p>

Take a = 1 and b = 1. Then 1 + 1 = 2. Is 2 a square in Z/4Z? The squares in Z/4Z are 0 and 1. So 2 is not a square, so Z/4Z doesn't satisfy the given condition. So this ring is invalid. How about the ring Z/2Z. In Z/2Z, 02=0 and 12=1. So for any a, b, a2 + b2 is either 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 0 = 1, or 1 + 1 = 0. Since 0 and 1 are squares, that works.</p>

At 80ms, cwnd=16, but effective window is10. The remaining data is3 segments. Therefore, the server can send all3. So time taken for these 3 segments: transmission time. But since we're considering RTT at fixed20ms, thesender can transmit the3 segments and get ACK in 20ms? Or since it's fewer than then window size, it can send them and get the ACKs faster.

In some models, if you have W segments to send, and you have a bandwidth constraint, the time to send all W segments is(W *T_tx_Time) + RTT. But if RTT>> T_tx_time, then it makes little difference.</p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver recognizes that their current approach is becoming too complex ("this is a bit tricky") and strategically shifts to examining specific small cases. When the initial attempts with n=1 don't yield useful information, they immediately adjust their approach, looking for different parameter values that might connect 1 to other numbers. This demonstrates the ability to monitor progress and adapt strategies when needed.</p>

So, T seems to consist of lines connecting the point (0,1) to every rational point on the x-axis (since when t is 1, y-coordinate is 0, and x-coordinate is any rational number). So, it's like a fan-shaped set with vertex at (0,1) and each "spoke" of the fan going to a different rational point on the x-axis.</p>

Let's check the y-coordinate first: The y-coordinate from the line segment is 1 - (λ t1 + (1 - λ) t2). That would correspond to t = λ t1 + (1 - λ) t2. Then the x-coordinate would need to be t q = (λ t1 + (1 - λ) t2) q. But in the line segment, the x-coordinate is λ t1 q1 + (1 - λ) t2 q2. So we need λ t1 q1 + (1 - λ) t2 q2 = (λ t1 + (1 - λ) t2) q for some q ∈ Q. This is only possible if q1 = q2 = q, meaning that the two points are on the same spoke. Otherwise, for arbitrary q1 and q2, the linear combination would not be a scalar multiple of a single rational number. Therefore, the line segment between two points on different spokes is not contained in T. Hence T is not convex.</p>
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The solver demonstrates sophisticated topological reasoning by analyzing whether the line segment between two points in T remains within T. They carefully track how the coordinates change along this line segment and identify the specific condition needed for the segment to remain in T. This analysis reveals that T is not convex, which is a key topological property relevant to fixed point theorems.</p>

An irreducible permutation is a permutation that does not have a prefix which is a permutation of {1, ..., j} for any j < k. Wait, exactly! So, our N_i is equal to the number of irreducible permutations of length i multiplied by (7 - i)!.</p>
