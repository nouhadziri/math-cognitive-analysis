1. $ 

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
To find all numbers \( n \) for which there exist three (not necessarily distinct) roots of unity of order \( n \) whose sum is 1, we will use the properties of roots of unity.

1. **Roots of Unity Representation**:
   Let \( \omega = e^{2\pi i / n} \) be a primitive \( n \)-th root of unity. The \( n \)-th roots of unity are \( 1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{n-1} \).

2. **Sum of Three Roots of Unity**:
   We need to find \( i, j, k \) such that:
   \[
   \omega^i + \omega^j + \omega^k = 1
   \]
   and
   \[
   \omega^i + \omega^j + \omega^k = 1 + 0i
   \]
   This implies that the imaginary parts must sum to zero:
   \[
   \sin\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) = 0
   \]
   and the real parts must sum to one:
   \[
   \cos\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) = 1
   \]

3. **Squaring and Adding**:
   Squaring the real part equation:
   \[
   \left(\cos\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)\right)^2 = 1
   \]
   Expanding and using the Pythagorean identity:
   \[
   \cos^2\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right) + \cos^2\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right) + \cos^2\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) + 2\left(\cos\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right)\right) = 1
   \]
   Similarly, for the imaginary part:
   \[
   \left(\sin\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)\right)^2 = 0
   \]
   Expanding and using the Pythagorean identity:
   \[
   \sin^2\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) + 2\left(\sin\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right)\sin\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right)\sin\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)\sin\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right)\right) = 0
   \]

4. **Combining Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   Adding the squared equations:
   \[
   \cos^2\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right) + \cos^2\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right) + \cos^2\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) + 2\left(\cos\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right)\right) = 1
   \]
   Using the identity \( \cos^2 x + \sin^2 x = 1 \):
   \[
   3 + 2\left(\cos\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right)\right) = 1
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   2\left(\cos\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right)\right) = -2
   \]
   \[
   \cos\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi j}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\right) = -1
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   The above condition is satisfied if \( n \) is even. For even \( n \), we can always find such roots of unity. For example, for \( n = 2 \), the roots are \( 1 \) and \( -1 \), and we can choose \( 1, 1, -1 \) whose sum is \( 1 \).

Thus, the answer is any even positive integer.

The final answer is \(\boxed{\text{Any even positive integer}}\)
