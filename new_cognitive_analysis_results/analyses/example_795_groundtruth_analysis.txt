Problem:
The state $\psi$ of a system is given in terms of a complete and orthonormal set of basis vectors $|\phi_1>,  |\phi_2>,  |\phi_3>$ and $| \phi_4 >$ as $|\psi> = \sqrt{1/15} |\phi_1> + \sqrt{2/15} |\phi_2> + 2/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_3> + 4/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_4>$. The basis vectors $|\phi_n>$ are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator $H$ satisfying $H |\phi_n> = n E_o |\phi_n>; n=1, 2, 3, 4. Calculate the average energy of the system in some repeated measurements. 

Answer Choices:
(A) 1/23 E_o
(B) E_o
(C) 81/15 E_o
(D) 81/23 E_o

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
It is a simple problem of calculating the expectation value of the Hamiltonian operator H. Using the defining equation, $<\psi|H|\psi>$, of the expectation value one can easily obtain the average energy of the system. In the steps,  one need to use the given eigenvalue equation and the orthonormality conditions of the eigenstates. Note that the given state $|\psi>$ is not normalized. So, need to divide the obtained result by $<\psi | \psi> = 23/15$.
