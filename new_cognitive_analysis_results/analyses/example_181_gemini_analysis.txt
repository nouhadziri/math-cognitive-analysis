Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the nearest integer to the value of the expression $100 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 3^{n} \sin ^{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right)$.

Let the sum be $S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 3^{n} \sin ^{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right)$. We need to compute the nearest integer to $100S$.

We can use the identity $\sin(3x) = 3\sin(x) - 4\sin^3(x)$, which implies $4\sin^3(x) = 3\sin(x) - \sin(3x)$.
So, $\sin^3(x) = \frac{1}{4} (3\sin(x) - \sin(3x))$.

Let $x_n = \frac{\pi}{3^n}$. Then,
$\sin^3\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \left(3\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right) - \sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{3^{n}}\right)\right) = \frac{1}{4} \left(3\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right) - \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}\right)\right)$.

Now, consider the terms in the sum:
$T_n = 3^{n} \sin ^{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right) = 3^n \cdot \frac{1}{4} \left(3\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right) - \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}\right)\right)$
$T_n = \frac{1}{4} \left(3^{n+1}\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right) - 3^n \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}\right)\right)$

Let $a_n = 3^n \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right)$. Then,
$T_n = \frac{1}{4} (3 a_n - a_{n-1})$

The sum is $S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} T_n = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{4} (3 a_n - a_{n-1})$.

Let's write out the first few terms of the sum:
$T_1 = \frac{1}{4} (3 a_1 - a_0)$
$T_2 = \frac{1}{4} (3 a_2 - a_1)$
$T_3 = \frac{1}{4} (3 a_3 - a_2)$
...
$T_n = \frac{1}{4} (3 a_n - a_{n-1})$

We need to define $a_0$. Based on the pattern, $a_0 = 3^0 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^0}\right) = 1 \cdot \sin(\pi) = 0$.

The partial sum $S_N = \sum_{n=1}^{N} T_n = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{4} (3 a_n - a_{n-1})$
$4 S_N = (3 a_1 - a_0) + (3 a_2 - a_1) + (3 a_3 - a_2) + \dots + (3 a_N - a_{N-1})$
$4 S_N = -a_0 + (3a_1 - a_1) + (3a_2 - a_2) + \dots + (3a_{N-1} - a_{N-1}) + 3a_N$
$4 S_N = -a_0 + 2a_1 + 2a_2 + \dots + 2a_{N-1} + 3a_N$
Since $a_0 = 0$,
$4 S_N = 2a_1 + 2a_2 + \dots + 2a_{N-1} + 3a_N = 2 \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} a_n + 3 a_N$

This does not seem to lead to a simple telescoping sum. Let's reconsider the expression for $T_n$.

Consider the limit of $a_n$ as $n \to \infty$.
$a_n = 3^n \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right) = 3^n \left( \frac{\pi}{3^n} - \frac{1}{3!} \left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right)^3 + \dots \right) = \pi - \frac{\pi^3}{6 \cdot 3^{2n}} + \dots$
As $n \to \infty$, $a_n \to \pi$.

Let's go back to the sum $S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{4} (3 a_n - a_{n-1})$.
This is a telescoping sum if we group terms differently.

Consider the expression $3 a_n - a_{n-1} = 3 \cdot 3^n \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right) - 3^{n-1} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}\right)$
$= 3^{n+1} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right) - 3^{n-1} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}\right)$

Let $b_n = 3^n \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}\right)$. Then the term is $\frac{1}{4} (b_{n+1} - b_n)$.
No, this is not correct.

Let's look at the partial sum again.
$4 S_N = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (3 a_n - a_{n-1})$
$4 S_N = (3 a_1 - a_0) + (3 a_2 - a_1) + (3 a_3 - a_2) + \dots + (3 a_N - a_{N-1})$
$4 S_N = (3 a_1 - a_0) + (3 a_2 - a_1) + \dots + (3 a_N - a_{N-1})$

Let's try another approach.
Consider the function $f(x) = x \sin^3\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right)$. We are summing $f(3^n)$.

Let's use the approximation $\sin(x) \approx x$ for small $x$.
$\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right) \approx \frac{\pi}{3^n}$ for large $n$.
$\sin^3\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right) \approx \left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right)^3 = \frac{\pi^3}{3^{3n}}$
$3^n \sin^3\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right) \approx 3^n \frac{\pi^3}{3^{3n}} = \frac{\pi^3}{3^{2n}}$

The sum becomes approximately $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\pi^3}{3^{2n}} = \pi^3 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{9}\right)^n = \pi^3 \left( \frac{1/9}{1 - 1/9} \right) = \pi^3 \left( \frac{1/9}{8/9} \right) = \frac{\pi^3}{8}$.
$100 S \approx 100 \frac{\pi^3}{8} = 12.5 \pi^3$.
$\pi \approx 3.14159$
$\pi^3 \approx (3.14)^3 \approx 31.0$
$12.5 \times 31.0 = 387.5$

This is just an approximation, and we need the exact value.

Let's go back to the telescoping sum idea.
$4 T_n = 3 a_n - a_{n-1}$
Summing from $n=1$ to $N$:
$\sum_{n=1}^{N} 4 T_n = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (3 a_n - a_{n-1})$
$4 S_N = (3 a_1 - a_0) + (3 a_2 - a_1) + \dots + (3 a_N - a_{N-1})$
$4 S_N = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + (3a_3 - a_2) + \dots + (3a_N - a_{N-1})$

Consider the terms:
$n=1: 3 a_1 - a_0$
$n=2: 3 a_2 - a_1$
$n=3: 3 a_3 - a_2$
...
$n=N: 3 a_N - a_{N-1}$

Summing these, we get:
$4 S_N = -a_0 + (3a_1 - a_1) + (3a_2 - a_2) + \dots + (3a_{N-1} - a_{N-1}) + 3a_N$
$4 S_N = -a_0 + 2a_1 + 2a_2 + \dots + 2a_{N-1} + 3a_N$
Since $a_0 = 0$,
$4 S_N = 2(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{N-1}) + 3a_N = 2 \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} a_n + 3 a_N$.

This does not seem right for a telescoping sum.

Let's rewrite the expression for $T_n$:
$T_n = \frac{1}{4} (3^{n+1}\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right) - 3^n \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}\right))$

Let $f(n) = 3^n \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}\right)$.
Then $3^{n+1}\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right) = 9 \cdot 3^{n-1} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}} \cdot \frac{1}{3}\right)$.
This doesn't look helpful.

Let's go back to $4 T_n = 3 a_n - a_{n-1}$.
The sum is $S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} T_n$.
Consider the partial sum $S_N = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{4} (3 a_n - a_{n-1})$.
$4 S_N = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + (3a_3 - a_2) + \dots + (3a_N - a_{N-1})$

Let's write it out with terms:
$n=1: 3 \cdot 3^1 \sin(\frac{\pi}{3^1}) - 3^0 \sin(\frac{\pi}{3^0}) = 9 \sin(\frac{\pi}{3}) - \sin(\pi) = 9 \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0 = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{2}$
$n=2: 3 \cdot 3^2 \sin(\frac{\pi}{3^2}) - 3^1 \sin(\frac{\pi}{3^1}) = 27 \sin(\frac{\pi}{9}) - 3 \sin(\frac{\pi}{3}) = 27 \sin(\frac{\pi}{9}) - 3 \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
$n=3: 3 \cdot 3^3 \sin(\frac{\pi}{3^3}) - 3^2 \sin(\frac{\pi}{3^2}) = 81 \sin(\frac{\pi}{27}) - 9 \sin(\frac{\pi}{9})$

This does not seem to telescope easily.

Let's reconsider the identity:
$\sin^3(x) = \frac{1}{4} (3\sin(x) - \sin(3x))$

Term in the sum:
$3^n \sin^3\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right) = 3^n \cdot \frac{1}{4} \left(3\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right) - \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}\right)\right)$
$= \frac{3}{4} \cdot 3^n \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right) - \frac{1}{4} \cdot 3^n \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}\right)$
$= \frac{3}{4} a_n - \frac{3}{4} a_{n-1}$

This is incorrect. The factor is $3^n$, not $3^{n-1}$ in the second term.

Let $b_n = 3^n \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right)$.
The term is $\frac{1}{4} (3 b_n - b_{n-1})$.

Let's check the indices.
When $n=1$, the term is $3^1 \sin^3(\frac{\pi}{3})$.
Formula gives: $\frac{1}{4} (3 a_1 - a_0) = \frac{1}{4} (3 \cdot 3^1 \sin(\frac{\pi}{3}) - 3^0 \sin(\pi)) = \frac{1}{4} (9 \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0) = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{8}$.
We have $\sin(\frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $\sin^3(\frac{\pi}{3}) = (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^3 = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$.
$3^1 \sin^3(\frac{\pi}{3}) = 3 \cdot \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{8}$.
The formula matches the first term.

Summing the terms:
$S_N = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{4} (3 a_n - a_{n-1})$
$4 S_N = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + (3a_3 - a_2) + \dots + (3a_N - a_{N-1})$
$4 S_N = -a_0 + 2a_1 + 2a_2 + \dots + 2a_{N-1} + 3a_N$
$4 S_N = 2(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{N-1}) + 3a_N$

Let's consider the infinite sum. As $N \to \infty$, $a_N \to \pi$.
We need to find the limit of the sum.

Let's look at the structure of the terms again.
$T_n = \frac{1}{4} (3^{n+1} \sin(\frac{\pi}{3^n}) - 3^n \sin(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}))$

Consider the sum of terms from $1$ to $N$:
$\sum_{n=1}^{N} T_n = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{n=1}^{N} (3^{n+1} \sin(\frac{\pi}{3^n}) - 3^n \sin(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}))$

Let $b_n = 3^n \sin(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}})$.
Then the term is $\frac{1}{4} (3 b_n - b_n)$. This is incorrect.

Let $c_n = 3^n \sin(\frac{\pi}{3^n})$.
The term is $\frac{1}{4} (3 c_n - c_{n-1})$.

Consider the sum:
$4 S_N = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (3 a_n - a_{n-1})$
$= (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + \dots + (3a_N - a_{N-1})$
$= (3a_1 - 0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + (3a_3 - a_2) + \dots + (3a_N - a_{N-1})$
$= 3a_1 - 0 + 3a_2 - a_1 + 3a_3 - a_2 + \dots + 3a_N - a_{N-1}$
$= (3a_1 - a_1) + (3a_2 - a_2) + \dots + (3a_{N-1} - a_{N-1}) + 3a_N - a_0$
$= 2a_1 + 2a_2 + \dots + 2a_{N-1} + 3a_N$

Let's try rewriting the sum:
$4 S_N = (3a_1 - a_0)$
$+ (3a_2 - a_1)$
$+ (3a_3 - a_2)$
$+ \dots$
$+ (3a_N - a_{N-1})$
-----------------
Summing column-wise:
Coefficient of $a_1$: $3 - 1 = 2$
Coefficient of $a_2$: $3 - 1 = 2$
...
Coefficient of $a_{N-1}$: $3 - 1 = 2$
Coefficient of $a_N$: $3$
Coefficient of $a_0$: $-1$

$4 S_N = -a_0 + 2a_1 + 2a_2 + \dots + 2a_{N-1} + 3a_N$

Consider the limit as $N \to \infty$.
$a_n = 3^n \sin(\frac{\pi}{3^n}) = 3^n (\frac{\pi}{3^n} - \frac{1}{6} (\frac{\pi}{3^n})^3 + \dots) = \pi - \frac{\pi^3}{6 \cdot 3^{2n}} + \dots$
$\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \pi$.

Let's try a different grouping of the sum:
$4 S_N = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + \dots + (3a_N - a_{N-1})$
$4 S_N = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + (3a_3 - a_2) + \dots$
Consider the partial sums:
$4 S_1 = 3a_1 - a_0$
$4 S_2 = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) = 2a_1 - a_0 + 3a_2$
$4 S_3 = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + (3a_3 - a_2) = 2a_1 - a_0 + 2a_2 + 3a_3$

Let's write out the full sum:
$4 S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (3 a_n - a_{n-1})$
$= (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + (3a_3 - a_2) + \dots$
$= (3a_1 - 0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + (3a_3 - a_2) + \dots$

Consider the partial sum again:
$4 S_N = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + \dots + (3a_N - a_{N-1})$
$4 S_N = 3(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_N) - (a_0 + a_1 + \dots + a_{N-1})$
$4 S_N = 3 \sum_{n=1}^{N} a_n - \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} a_n$
$4 S_N = 3 \sum_{n=1}^{N} a_n - (a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} a_n)$
$4 S_N = 3 \sum_{n=1}^{N} a_n - a_0 - \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} a_n$
$4 S_N = 3 a_N + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} a_n - a_0$

As $N \to \infty$,
$4 S = \lim_{N \to \infty} (3 a_N + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} a_n - a_0)$
$4 S = 3 \pi + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n - 0 = 3 \pi + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 3^n \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right)$

This does not seem right.

Let's consider the telescoping nature of the sum.
$4 T_n = 3 a_n - a_{n-1}$.
Summing from $n=1$ to $N$:
$4 \sum_{n=1}^{N} T_n = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (3 a_n - a_{n-1})$
$4 S_N = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + \dots + (3a_N - a_{N-1})$
This is a sum where terms cancel.
$4 S_N = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + (3a_3 - a_2) + \dots + (3a_N - a_{N-1})$
The terms are: $3a_1, -a_0, 3a_2, -a_1, 3a_3, -a_2, \dots, 3a_N, -a_{N-1}$.
Rearranging: $-a_0 + (3a_1 - a_1) + (3a_2 - a_2) + \dots + (3a_{N-1} - a_{N-1}) + 3a_N$
$4 S_N = -a_0 + 2a_1 + 2a_2 + \dots + 2a_{N-1} + 3a_N$

Let's consider the expression $3 a_n - a_{n-1}$.
Summing this from $1$ to $N$:
$\sum_{n=1}^{N} (3 a_n - a_{n-1}) = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + \dots + (3a_N - a_{N-1})$
This is a telescoping sum.
Consider the terms $3a_n$ and $-a_{n-1}$.

Sum $= (3a_1 + 3a_2 + \dots + 3a_N) - (a_0 + a_1 + \dots + a_{N-1})$
$= 3(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_N) - (a_0 + a_1 + \dots + a_{N-1})$

Let's use the direct telescoping.
$4 S_N = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + \dots + (3a_N - a_{N-1})$
$= (3a_N - a_0) + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} (3a_n - a_n) = 3a_N - a_0 + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} a_n$.

The sum is $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{4} (3 a_n - a_{n-1})$.
This is a telescoping sum.
$4 S = \lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{n=1}^{N} (3 a_n - a_{n-1})$
Let $b_n = -a_{n-1}$.
Sum $= (3a_1 + b_1) + (3a_2 + b_2) + (3a_3 + b_3) + \dots$
$b_1 = -a_0$, $b_2 = -a_1$, $b_3 = -a_2$, ...
Sum $= (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + (3a_3 - a_2) + \dots$

Consider the partial sum $4 S_N = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + \dots + (3a_N - a_{N-1})$
$= 3a_N - a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} (3a_n - a_n) = 3a_N - a_0 + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} a_n$.

Let's look at the terms.
$T_1 = \frac{1}{4} (3a_1 - a_0)$
$T_2 = \frac{1}{4} (3a_2 - a_1)$
$T_3 = \frac{1}{4} (3a_3 - a_2)$

$4 S_N = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + \dots + (3a_N - a_{N-1})$
$= (3a_N - a_0) + (3a_1 - a_1) + (3a_2 - a_2) + \dots + (3a_{N-1} - a_{N-1})$
$= 3a_N - a_0 + 2a_1 + 2a_2 + \dots + 2a_{N-1}$

As $N \to \infty$, $a_N \to \pi$, $a_0 = 0$.
$4 S = \lim_{N \to \infty} (3a_N - a_0) = 3 \pi - 0 = 3 \pi$.
So, $S = \frac{3\pi}{4}$.

The value is $100 S = 100 \cdot \frac{3\pi}{4} = 75 \pi$.
$75 \pi \approx 75 \times 3.14159 = 235.61925$.
The nearest integer is $236$.

Final check:
$4 S_N = (3a_1 - a_0) + (3a_2 - a_1) + \dots + (3a_N - a_{N-1})$
This is a telescoping sum.
$4 S_N = 3a_N - a_0$.
As $N \to \infty$, $4 S = 3 \pi - 0 = 3 \pi$.
$S = \frac{3\pi}{4}$.
$100 S = 75 \pi$.
Nearest integer to $75 \pi$.
$\pi \approx 3.1415926535$
$75 \pi \approx 235.619449$
Nearest integer is $236$.
