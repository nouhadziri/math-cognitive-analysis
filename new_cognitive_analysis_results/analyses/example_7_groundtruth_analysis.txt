Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
(a) Let the number of promoted participants be \( P \) and the number of repeaters be \( R \). We know that \( P + R = N \) and \( N < 40 \).

Given:
- The average score of all participants is 66.
- The average score of the promoted participants is 71.
- The average score of the repeaters is 56.

We can write the following equations based on the given averages:
\[
\frac{S_P + S_R}{N} = 66 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
\frac{S_P}{P} = 71 \quad \text{(2)}
\]
\[
\frac{S_R}{R} = 56 \quad \text{(3)}
\]

From equations (2) and (3), we get:
\[
S_P = 71P \quad \text{(4)}
\]
\[
S_R = 56R \quad \text{(5)}
\]

Substituting equations (4) and (5) into equation (1):
\[
\frac{71P + 56R}{P + R} = 66
\]

Multiplying both sides by \( P + R \):
\[
71P + 56R = 66(P + R)
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
71P + 56R = 66P + 66R
\]
\[
71P - 66P = 66R - 56R
\]
\[
5P = 10R
\]
\[
P = 2R \quad \text{(6)}
\]

Since \( P + R < 40 \), substituting \( P = 2R \):
\[
2R + R < 40
\]
\[
3R < 40
\]
\[
R < \frac{40}{3}
\]
\[
R < 13.33
\]

Since \( R \) must be an integer, the possible values for \( R \) are \( R = 1, 2, \ldots, 13 \).

Now, after increasing all scores by 5, the new averages are:
- The average score of the promoted participants becomes 75.
- The average score of the repeaters becomes 59.

The new total scores are:
\[
S_P' = 71P + 5P = 76P \quad \text{(7)}
\]
\[
S_R' = 56R + 5R = 61R \quad \text{(8)}
\]

The new averages give us:
\[
\frac{76P}{P} = 75 \quad \text{(9)}
\]
\[
\frac{61R}{R} = 59 \quad \text{(10)}
\]

From equations (9) and (10), we get:
\[
76P = 75P + 75x
\]
\[
61R = 59R + 59x
\]

Simplifying:
\[
P = 15x
\]
\[
R = 15x
\]

Since \( P = 2R \), we have:
\[
2R = 15x
\]
\[
R = 7.5x
\]

Since \( R \) must be an integer, \( x \) must be a multiple of 2. The possible values for \( x \) are \( x = 1, 2, \ldots, 6 \).

For \( x = 1 \):
\[
R = 7.5 \times 1 = 7.5 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
\]

For \( x = 2 \):
\[
R = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
\]

For \( x = 3 \):
\[
R = 7.5 \times 3 = 22.5 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
\]

For \( x = 4 \):
\[
R = 7.5 \times 4 = 30 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
\]

For \( x = 5 \):
\[
R = 7.5 \times 5 = 37.5 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
\]

For \( x = 6 \):
\[
R = 7.5 \times 6 = 45 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
\]

Therefore, there are no possible values for \( N \) in this case.

(b) Given:
- The average score of the promoted participants becomes 79.
- The average score of the repeaters becomes 47.

The new total scores are:
\[
S_P' = 71P + 5P = 76P \quad \text{(11)}
\]
\[
S_R' = 56R + 5R = 61R \quad \text{(12)}
\]

The new averages give us:
\[
\frac{76P}{P} = 79 \quad \text{(13)}
\]
\[
\frac{61R}{R} = 47 \quad \text{(14)}
\]

From equations (13) and (14), we get:
\[
76P = 79P + 79x
\]
\[
61R = 47R + 47x
\]

Simplifying:
\[
P = 4x
\]
\[
R = 4x
\]

Since \( P = 2R \), we have:
\[
2R = 4x
\]
\[
R = 2x
\]

Since \( R \) must be an integer, \( x \) must be a multiple of 1. The possible values for \( x \) are \( x = 1, 2, \ldots, 6 \).

For \( x = 1 \):
\[
R = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]
\[
P = 2R = 4
\]
\[
N = P + R = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

For \( x = 2 \):
\[
R = 2 \times 2 = 4
\]
\[
P = 2R = 8
\]
\[
N = P + R = 8 + 4 = 12
\]

For \( x = 3 \):
\[
R = 2 \times 3 = 6
\]
\[
P = 2R = 12
\]
\[
N = P + R = 12 + 6 = 18
\]

For \( x = 4 \):
\[
R = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]
\[
P = 2R = 16
\]
\[
N = P + R = 16 + 8 = 24
\]

For \( x = 5 \):
\[
R = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]
\[
P = 2R = 20
\]
\[
N = P + R = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

For \( x = 6 \):
\[
R = 2 \times 6 = 12
\]
\[
P = 2R = 24
\]
\[
N = P + R = 24 + 12 = 36
\]

Therefore, the possible values for \( N \) are \( N = 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 \).

(a) The final answer is \( \boxed{ N = 21 } \).
