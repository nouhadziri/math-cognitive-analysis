Problem:
The state $|\psi (t)>$ of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (1/6, 0, 4/6). An operator P corresponding to an observable of the system is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as ($\sqrt{2}$, 0, 0), that in the second row as (0, $1/\sqrt{2}$, $i/ \sqrt{2}$), and that in the third row as (0, $-i/\sqrt{2}$, $1/ \sqrt{2}$). What are the degenerate eigenvalue and the corresponding degeneracy? What are the probabilities of obtaining those degenerate eigenvalues at any measurement? 
Answer Choices:
(A) Degenerate eigenvalue is 0, degeneracy is 2, and the probabilities are 1/17 and 3/17.
(B) Degenerate eigenvalue is \sqrt{3}, degeneracy is 3, and the probabilities are 3/17 and 12/17.
(C) Degenerate eigenvalue is 2, degeneracy is 2, and the probabilities are 8/17 and 8/17.
(D) Degenerate eigenvalue is \sqrt{2}, degeneracy is 2, and the probabilities are 8/17 and 1/17.

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to figure out the degenerate eigenvalue and the corresponding degeneracy for the operator P given in the problem. Then, I have to find the probabilities of measuring those degenerate eigenvalues. The answer choices are from A to D, so maybe I can work through it step by step.

First, let's recall that degenerate eigenvalues are eigenvalues that have more than one linearly independent eigenvector. That means their eigenspace has a dimension greater than one, right? So the degeneracy is the number of distinct eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue, which is the dimension of the eigenspace.

The operator P is given as a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (√2, 0, 0). The second row is (0, 1/√2, i/√2), and the third row is (0, -i/√2, 1/√2). So, let's write that out in a clearer form:

P = [ [√2, 0, 0],
       [0, 1/√2, i/√2],
       [0, -i/√2, 1/√2] ]

Hmm. To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me set up the matrix P - λI:

[√2 - λ, 0, 0]
[0, (1/√2) - λ, i/√2]
[0, -i/√2, (1/√2) - λ]

Now, the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated by expanding along the first row, since there are zeros that might make it easier. The first element is (√2 - λ), then two zeros. So the determinant would be:

(√2 - λ) * det[ [(1/√2 - λ), i/√2],
                [-i/√2, (1/√2 - λ)] ] 

That's because the determinant of a block matrix where the first row has elements (A, B, C) and the rest have zeros except in the other blocks. So expanding along the first row, only the first element contributes.

So, first, let's compute the determinant of the 2x2 matrix in the lower right corner:

det = [(1/√2 - λ)^2 - (-i/√2)(i/√2)]

Multiply that out. Let's compute the second term:

(-i/√2)(i/√2) = (-i^2)/(√2 * √2) = (-(-1))/2 = 1/2

Therefore, the determinant of the 2x2 matrix is:

(1/√2 - λ)^2 + 1/2

Wait, since it's [(1/√2 - λ)^2 - (-i/√2 * i/√2)]. Wait, the formula for determinant is ad - bc. Here, a = (1/√2 - λ), d = (1/√2 - λ), b = i/√2, c = -i/√2. So:

det = (1/√2 - λ)(1/√2 - λ) - (i/√2)(-i/√2)
     = (1/√2 - λ)^2 - (-i^2)/(√2 * √2)
     = (1/√2 - λ)^2 - ( - (-1)/2 )
     = (1/√2 - λ)^2 - (1/2)

Wait, wait. Hold on. Let's compute bc: (i/√2)(-i/√2) = -i^2 / 2 = -(-1)/2 = 1/2. Therefore, det = ad - bc = (1/√2 - λ)^2 - (1/2)

Therefore, the determinant is:

(1/√2 - λ)^2 - 1/2

So the overall determinant of P - λI is:

(√2 - λ) * [ (1/√2 - λ)^2 - 1/2 ] = 0

Therefore, the eigenvalues are the solutions to this equation.

So, set each factor equal to zero.

First, √2 - λ = 0 → λ = √2

Second, (1/√2 - λ)^2 - 1/2 = 0 → (1/√2 - λ)^2 = 1/2

Take square roots:

1/√2 - λ = ± 1/√2

So, solving for λ:

Case 1: 1/√2 - λ = 1/√2 → λ = 0

Case 2: 1/√2 - λ = -1/√2 → λ = 1/√2 + 1/√2 = 2/√2 = √2

Wait, hold on. Hmm, so the equation (1/√2 - λ)^2 = 1/2 leads to 1/√2 - λ = ±1/√2, hence:

For plus sign: 1/√2 - λ = 1/√2 ⇒ λ = 0

For minus sign: 1/√2 - λ = -1/√2 ⇒ λ = 1/√2 + 1/√2 = 2/√2 = √2

Therefore, the roots are λ = √2, λ = 0, and λ = √2

Wait, so the eigenvalues are √2, √2, and 0. But wait, the quadratic factor (from the 2x2 matrix) produces two eigenvalues: 0 and 2/√2 which is √2? Wait: Let's see.

Wait no, when solving (1/√2 - λ)^2 = 1/2, expand left side:

(1/2 - 2λ/√2 + λ2) = 1/2

Subtract 1/2: -2λ/√2 + λ2 = 0

Multiply by √2:

-2λ + √2 λ2 = 0

Factor:

λ( -2 + √2 λ ) = 0 ⇒ λ = 0 or λ = 2 / √2 = √2

Yes, so the eigenvalues are √2 from the first root (twice, since the quadratic gives two solutions where one is √2 and the other 0? Wait, no: when solving (1/√2 - λ)^2 = 1/2, we get two solutions for λ: 0 and √2.

But this quadratic is part of the overall polynomial, which is (√2 - λ)( (1/√2 - λ)^2 - 1/2 ) = 0, expanding all:

(√2 - λ)[(1/√2 - λ)^2 - 1/2] = 0

Which gives three eigenvalues: √2 (degeneracy 1), 0 (degeneracy 1), and √2 (degeneracy 1). Wait, that can’t be. Wait, let's check again.

Wait, perhaps when expanding (1/√2 - λ)^2 - 1/2 = 0, the equation is quadratic in λ, so it has two roots: λ = 0 and λ = √2.

So the characteristic equation is:

(√2 - λ)(λ - 0)(λ - √2) ) = 0 ?

Wait, actually, the determinant is (√2 - λ) * [ (1/√2 - λ)^2 - 1/2 ]

Expand the second factor:

(1/√2 - λ)^2 - 1/2 = (1/2 - 2λ/√2 + λ2) - 1/2 = λ2 - √2 λ * 2 + 0 = λ2 - 2√2 λ

Wait, wait a second: Wait 2λ/√2? Let's calculate:

First, (1/√2 - λ)^2 = (1/√2)^2 - 2*(1/√2)*λ + λ2 = 1/2 - (2/√2) λ + λ2.

Then subtract 1/2: we have (1/2 - 2/√2 λ + λ2) - 1/2 = λ2 - 2/√2 λ

So λ2 - (2/√2) λ = 0 ⇒ λ (λ - 2/√2 ) = 0.

Wait, 2/√2 = √2. Because 2/√2 = √2 * √2 / √2 = √2. So yeah, the quadratic equation becomes λ(λ - √2 ) = 0, so roots λ = 0 and λ = √2.

Therefore, the entire determinant equation is:

(√2 - λ)*λ*(√2 - λ) = (√2 - λ)^2 * λ = 0

So, eigenvalues: λ = √2 with multiplicity 2, and λ = 0 with multiplicity 1.

Wait! So originally, first factor is (√2 - λ) from the top-left entry, and the quadratic gives roots 0 and √2. So in total, the eigenvalues are √2, √2, and 0.

Therefore, the eigenvalues are √2 (degeneracy 2) and 0 (degeneracy 1). Therefore, the degenerate eigenvalue is √2 with degeneracy 2. Wait, but the possible answer options have to match.

Looking at the options, (D) says degenerate eigenvalue is √2, degeneracy 2. So maybe that's an option. However, need to confirm.

Wait, but let's check again.

The determinant:

det(P - λI) = (√2 - λ)[ (1/√2 - λ)^2 - (-i/√2)(i/√2) ]

Wait, earlier steps may have had a miscalculation.

So perhaps compute the determinant correctly. Let me redo that step.

First row: (√2 - λ, 0, 0)

Second row: (0, (1/√2 - λ), i/√2)

Third row: (0, -i/√2, 1/√2 - λ)

The determinant of this matrix is indeed (√2 - λ) multiplied by the determinant of the 2x2 submatrix in the lower-right corner.

That submatrix is:

[ (1/√2 - λ)    i/√2        ]

[ -i/√2      (1/√2 - λ) ]

The determinant of this submatrix is:

(1/√2 - λ)(1/√2 - λ) - (i/√2)(-i/√2)

Compute each part:

First term: (1/√2 - λ)^2

Second term: - (i/√2)(-i/√2) = - [ (-i^2)/2 ] = - [ -(-1)/2 ] = - (1/2 )

Wait: (i/√2)(-i/√2) = -i^2/2 = -(-1)/2 = 1/2. So, (det) = (1/√2 - λ)^2 - (1/2)

Therefore, determinant is:

(1/√2 - λ)^2 - 1/2

Set this equal to zero:

(1/√2 - λ)^2 = 1/2

Take square roots:

1/√2 - λ = ±1/√2

Thus:

Case 1: 1/√2 - λ = 1/√2 → λ = 0

Case 2: 1/√2 - λ = -1/√2 → λ = 1/√2 + 1/√2 = 2/√2 = √2

Therefore, the eigenvalues from the 2x2 submatrix are 0 and √2. Therefore, combined with the first eigenvalue √2 (from the first term), we have eigenvalues: √2, √2, 0.

Hence, the eigenvalues are √2 with multiplicity 2 and 0 with multiplicity 1. Thus, the degenerate eigenvalue is √2, with degeneracy 2.

Now, let's check the answer choices.

Option D says degenerate eigenvalue is √2, degeneracy is 2, and probabilities are 8/17 and 1/17. Wait, but probabilities summing to 9/17? But the probabilities should correspond to the projections onto the eigenvectors.

But hold on. Let me check the answer choices again:

(A) Eigenvalue 0, degeneracy 2. Not possible because 0 is a single eigenvalue here.

(B) eigenvalue √3, which we don't have.

(C) eigenvalue 2, degeneracy 2. We have sqrt2 and 0.

(D) degenerate eigenvalue is sqrt2, degeneracy 2, probabilities 8/17 and 1/17.

So, according to the eigenvalues, √2 is the degenerate eigenvalue with multiplicity 2. So answer D or C? Wait, answer C says eigenvalue 2, but we have sqrt2 as a degenerate eigenvalue.

Therefore, likely answer D. So now, moving on. Now, the second part is the probabilities of obtaining those eigenvalues when measuring.

Given the state |ψ(t)> is given as a column vector (1/6, 0, 4/6). Wait, but the entries are given as (1/6, 0, 4/6). Wait, but let me check:

Wait, state vector: elements (1/6, 0, 4/6). So, normalized? Let me check the norm.

(1/6)^2 + 0 + (4/6)^2 = (1 + 0 + 16)/36 = 17/36. Wait, 17/36. So the norm is sqrt(17)/6. Wait, so if we have (1/6, 0, 4/6), that is not normalized. To get the state vector, we should normalize it.

But the problem says "the state |ψ(t)> of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (1/6, 0, 4/6)". If we write this as a vector, it's:

|ψ(t)> = [1/6, 0, 4/6]^T

But since the norm squared is (1/6)^2 + (0)^2 + (4/6)^2 = (1 + 16)/36 = 17/36. So the norm is sqrt(17)/6, which is not 1. Therefore, this vector is not normalized. But in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. However, the problem states the state "is given by the column matrix", so maybe we take it as is, even if it's not normalized. Then, probabilities would be calculated with the squared components with respect to the eigenvectors, divided by the norm squared of the state vector.

Alternatively, maybe they made a mistake and the vector is supposed to be normalized. Wait, let's see.

But let's proceed. Suppose the state is given as (1/6, 0, 4/6). To compute probabilities, first, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue √2, which is degenerate.

So, need to find the eigenvectors for the eigenvalue √2. Then, the probability is the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto each eigenvector, divided by the norm squared of the state vector if it's not normalized.

First, since the state vector is given with entries (1/6, 0, 4/6), but we need to compute its components in the eigenbasis of P.

Let me first compute the eigenvectors for the eigenvalue λ=√2.

For eigenvalue λ=√2, we solve (P - √2 I)|v> = 0.

So, the matrix (P - √2 I) is:

First row: [√2 - √2, 0, 0] = [0, 0, 0]

Second row: [0, 1/√2 - √2, i/√2]

Third row: [0, -i/√2, 1/√2 - √2]

Compute the entries:

1/√2 - √2 = (1 - 2)/√2 = (-1)/√2. So the second row becomes [0, -1/√2, i/√2]

Third row similarly: (1/√2 - √2) = -1/√2. So third row [0, -i/√2, -1/√2]

Therefore, the matrix (P - √2 I) is:

Row 1: [0, 0, 0]

Row 2: [0, -1/√2, i/√2]

Row 3: [0, -i/√2, -1/√2]

Therefore, the equations from rows 2 and 3 are:

- (1/√2)v_2 + (i/√2)v_3 = 0

- (i/√2)v_2 - (1/√2)v_3 = 0

Let me write these equations:

From row 2: - (1/√2)v2 + (i/√2)v3 = 0 → multiply both sides by √2: -v2 + i v3 = 0 → v2 = i v3

From row 3: -i/√2 v2 -1/√2 v3 = 0. Multiply by √2: -i v2 - v3 = 0. Substitute v2 = i v3:

- i (i v3) - v3 = 0 → - i^2 v3 - v3 = 0 → - (-1) v3 - v3 = 0 → v3 - v3 =0 → 0 = 0

So only one independent equation, v2 = i v3. So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, i v3, v3). Additionally, from row 1, since all entries are zero, v1 can be arbitrary. Wait, no. Wait: looking at the set up, row 1 is all zeros, so the equation is 0*v1 + 0*v2 + 0*v3 =0, so no constraint on v1. Therefore, the eigenvectors for λ=√2 have v1 arbitrary, and v2 = i v3, but v3 can be arbitrary. Wait, let's parameterize them.

Let me take parameters. Let me let v3 = a (complex number), then v2 = i a. And v1 can be arbitrary, say b.

Therefore, the eigenvectors are:

|v> = [b, i a, a]^T where b and a are complex numbers, not both zero.

Therefore, the eigenvectors for λ=√2 are spanned by two vectors: one with a=0 and b arbitrary, and another with b=0 and a arbitrary.

Wait, but if a and b are parameters, then the eigenspace is two-dimensional: for example, basis vectors can be taken as [1, 0, 0]^T (a=0, b=1) and [0, i, 1]^T (b=0, a=1). Wait, but in our case, row 1 is all zeros, so v1 is a free variable. So if a=0, v3=0, then v2=0, so the eigenvector is (b,0,0). If b ≠0, then this is an eigenvector in the direction of the first basis vector. But when we substitute a=0, v2=0, v3=0, so any combination with v1 arbitrary and v2, v3 zero. Similarly, for b=0, we can take eigenvectors (0, i a, a). Thus, the eigenspace for √2 is two-dimensional: the first dimension is along e1, and the second is along a combination of e2 and e3. So the eigenvectors are indeed two-dimensional.

Therefore, any vector in this eigenspace can be written as a linear combination of [1, 0, 0]^T and [0, i, 1]^T. Hence, degeneracy is 2.

So, now, we need to project the state |ψ(t)> onto this eigenspace, and find the probabilities.

But first, we need to normalize the state |ψ(t)>.

Wait, the problem says the state is given by the column matrix elements (1/6, 0, 4/6). As we computed earlier, the norm squared is (1^2 + 0 + 4^2)/6^2 = (1 + 16)/36 =17/36. So the norm is sqrt(17)/6, hence the normalized state vector is (1/√17, 0, 4/√17).

But the problem statement doesn't say whether it's normalized or not. So, in the Born rule, the probability is the squared modulus of the projection divided by the squared norm of the vector if it's not normalized. Alternatively, since probabilities need to sum to 1, so perhaps the vector must be normalized, and perhaps (1/6, 0, 4/6) is written incorrectly. Wait, 1/6, 0, 4/6, but 4/6 is 2/3. 1/6 + 4/6 = 5/6. Wait, that's only 5/6 in the first and third components, but the norm squared as (1/6)^2 + (4/6)^2 = 1/36 + 16/36 =17/36 ≈ 0.472, which is less than 1. So maybe there was an error in the problem's state? But perhaps it's correct. Let's note that.

Therefore, when calculating the probabilities, the standard approach is:

Probability of outcome λ is ||P_{λ} |ψ> ||2 / ||ψ||2 , where P_{λ} is the projector onto the λ eigenspace.

Therefore, we proceed as follows:

1. Find the projector onto the λ=√2 eigenspace.

2. Compute P_{√2} |ψ(t)>

3. The squared norm of that projection.

4. Divide by the squared norm of |ψ(t)> if it isn't normalized. The answer should be a sum of probabilities adding up to 1.

Similarly for the eigenvalue 0.

But since we have a degeneracy, the probability of getting the eigenvalue √2 is the squared magnitude of the projection onto that eigenspace divided by the squared norm of the vector. But in the answer choices, it's mentioning the probabilities of obtaining those degenerate eigenvalues. Wait, eigenvalues each have their probability, so since √2 is degenerate, there might be multiple eigenvectors, but the total probability for √2 is sum over probabilities of each eigenvector. However, the problem says "the probabilities of obtaining those degenerate eigenvalues". Wait, maybe the question is a bit ambiguous. But likely, they want the total probability of measuring √2, which would be the probability of getting the eigenvalue √2 (summed over its degeneracy). But looking at the answer choices, options have two probabilities for each, e.g., in option D: probabilities are 8/17 and 1/17. Hmm, maybe in this case, the degeneracy is 2, and the measurement can result in different eigenvectors corresponding to the same eigenvalue, so we can have probabilities for each eigenvector. But quantum mechanics postulates that the probability for an eigenvalue is the sum of the squares of the projections onto all eigenvectors of that eigenvalue. However, since eigenvectors are part of an orthonormal basis.

Wait, but if the eigenspace is two-dimensional, we need to choose an orthonormal basis for the eigenspace and then the projection is the sum of projections onto those basis vectors.

But since eigenvectors can be non-orthogonal, but in this case, since P is an observable, which must be Hermitian (as all quantum mechanical operators corresponding to observables are). Wait, but the given matrix P: let's check if it's Hermitian.

Check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose.

The given P matrix:

First row: [√2, 0, 0]

Second row: [0, 1/√2, i/√2]

Third row: [0, -i/√2, 1/√2]

Now, the conjugate transpose P† would be:

First row: [√2, 0, 0]

Second row: [0, 1/√2, -i/√2]

Third row: [0, i/√2, 1/√2]

Compare with original P. Second and third rows:

Original Second row: [0, 1/√2, i/√2]; third row: [0, -i/√2, 1/√2]

So the original P and P† differ in those entries. For matrix to Hermitian, those should be the same, but swapping the off-diagonal terms and conjugating. Indeed, the (2,3) entry of P is i/√2, and (3,2) is -i/√2. The conjugate of (2,3) entry would be -i/√2, which is equal to the (3,2) entry. Similarly, the (3,2) entry of P is -i/√2; its conjugate is i/√2, which is the (2,3) entry of P. So yes, P is equal to its conjugate transpose. Therefore, P is Hermitian.

Since P is Hermitian, then eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal, and we can have an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors.

Now, returning. So for the eigenvalue √2, the eigenspace is two-dimensional as per earlier. So we can choose two orthonormal eigenvectors in that eigenspace.

We had earlier [1,0,0]^T and normalized [0, i, 1]^T or something. Let's check the [0, i,1]^T vector. Its norm squared is 0 + (-i)(i) + 1*1 = 0 + 1 +1 = 2. Therefore, normalized as [0, i/√2, 1/√2]^T.

So the two orthonormal eigenvectors can be chosen as:

e1 = [1, 0, 0]^T (norm is 1)

e2 = [0, i/√2, 1/√2]^T (also norm 1)

Check orthogonality: e1† e2 = 1*0 + 0*(i/√2) +0*(1/√2) = 0. So they are orthogonal.

Therefore, the projectors onto these eigenvectors are |e1><e1| and |e2><e2|.

But maybe in the problem, they are considering the total projection onto the entire eigenspace. However, given that the answer lists two probabilities for the same eigenvalue, likely because there are two distinct eigenvectors. However, in standard quantum mechanics, the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue is the sum over the projections onto each orthonormal eigenvector. But since in an experiment, you get the eigenvalue with a probability equals to the sum of the squares of the coefficients on each orthonormal eigenvector.

But given the answer choices list two probabilities, perhaps implying that there are two eigenvectors each giving individual probabilities, and their sum is the total probability for the eigenvalue. Let's proceed. Maybe we need to compute the projection onto each of these two orthonormal eigenvectors and sum their probabilities, but answer choices have two probabilities for degenerate eigenvalues. Let me compute the projection onto each eigenvector.

The given state is |ψ(t)> = [1/6, 0, 4/6]^T. Let's compute the inner products with e1 and e2.

First, with e1 = [1,0,0]^T:

<e1 | ψ(t)> = (1)(1/6) + 0 + 0 = 1/6.

So the probability is |1/6|^2 / ||ψ||2 = (1/36) / (17/36) = 1/17.

Second, with e2 = [0, i/√2, 1/√2]^T:

<e2 | ψ(t)> = 0*(1/6) + (-i/√2)*0 + (1/√2)*(4/6) = (4/6)/√2 = 4/(6√2) = 2/(3√2) = √2/3

Thus, |<e2 | ψ>|^2 = (√2/3)^2 = 2/9.

Then, divide by ||ψ||2 =17/36:

Probability is (2/9) / (17/36) = (2/9)*(36/17)=8/17.

Thus, total probability for eigenvalue √2 is 1/17 +8/17 =9/17.

Alternatively, compute projection onto the entire eigenspace.

Wait, in general, the probability for eigenvalue √2 is the squared norm of the projection onto the eigenspace divided by the norm squared of |ψ>.

First, the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace is: P_√2 |ψ>

Where P_√2 is the projector onto the eigenspace of √2.

Since this is a two-dimensional subspace spanned by e1 and e2, then P_√2 = |e1><e1| + |e2><e2|

Hence, applying this to |ψ>:

P_√2 |ψ> = |e1><e1|ψ> + |e2><e2|ψ>

So, the coefficients are:

|e1><e1|ψ> is (1/6) * e1

and |e2><e2|ψ> is (√2 / 3) * e2

Hence, the squared norm of P_√2 |ψ> is |1/6 |^2 + |√2 /3 |^2= (1/36) + (2/9)= 1/36 +8/36=9/36=1/4.

But dividing by |ψ||^2=17/36 gives (1/4)/(17/36)= 9/17, same as before.

However, in quantum mechanics, the total probability is 9/17. But the options have two probabilities for the degenerate eigenvalues, so perhaps the problem is asking for the individual probabilities when measuring P, where the outcome is √2, but with multiplicity 2, so you can get the result in two different subspaces, but they have the same eigenvalue.

Wait, but usually, when an eigenvalue is degenerate, you just get the eigenvalue with a probability given by the projection onto the entire eigenspace. For the non-degenerate eigenvalue 0, the probability would be the projection onto its eigenvector. But how about here? The answer might expect the probabilities for each eigenstate that contribute to the degeneracy. Let's assume that because the answer options include probabilities that add up to something; for example, option D: 8/17 and 1/17, which sum to 9/17, which makes sense. But then the other probability for the eigenvalue 0 would be the remaining 8/17, but in other options...

Wait, let me check the answer choices:

(A) Degenerate eigenvalue is 0, degeneracy is 2, and probabilities are 1/17 and 3/17. But since if eigenvalue 0 is degenerate, but in our case, eigenvalue 0 has multiplicity 1. So A is not correct.

(B) Eigenvalue is √3, which we don't have. So no.

(C) eigenvalue is 2, which we didn't get. Eigenvalue here is √2.

(D) Degenerate eigenvalue is √2, degeneracy 2, probabilities 8/17 and 1/17. Sum them gives 9/17. Then eigenvalue 0 would have probability 17/17 - 9/17 =8/17. But in answer choice C, eigenvalues summing probabilities? Wait:

Wait, the probabilities of eigenvalues for the degenerate case√2 would each be probabilities for the eigenvectors, 8/17 and 1/17, which are separate, but only for the general case. But if P is degenerate, the state may be a combination of multiple eigenstates. The total probability for measuring eigenvalue√2 should be 9/17, but the problem says "the probabilities of obtaining those degenerate eigenvalues". Hmmm.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "What are the degenerate eigenvalue and the corresponding degeneracy? What are the probabilities of obtaining those degenerate eigenvalues at any measurement?" So maybe the probabilities of the degenerate eigenvalues (each occurrence? So if eigenvalue has multiplicity 2, but in that case, each outcome cannot be distinguished. In quantum mechanics, you only get the eigenvalue, not the specific eigenvector. Therefore, I think only the total probability for sqrt2 is 9/17, and for 0 is 8/17. But those options are not present. Wait, wait:

Wait, let's re-express the state squared components. Maybe the non-normalized vector has components (1/6,0,4/6). When computing probabilities, since the state is not necessarily normalized, the probabilities would be the squared projections divided by the squared norm:

Total squared norm is (1/6)^2 + (4/6)^2 = (1 +16)/36 =17/36.

Now, to compute probabilities:

For eigenvalue 0: let's also compute that.

The eigenvalue 0 is non-degenerate. Therefore, first we need to find its eigenvector.

Find eigenvectors for λ=0.

Solve (P -0 I)|v> =0 ⇒ P|v>=0.

Which gives:

Row 1: √2 v1 +0 +0=0 ⇒ v1=0

Row 2: 0 + (1/√2) v2 + (i/√2) v3 =0

Row 3:0 + (-i /√2) v2 + (1/√2) v3=0

So, v1 must be zero.

From row 2: (1/√2)v2 + (i/√2 )v3 =0

Multiply by √2: v2 + i v3=0. → v2= -i v3

From row 3: (-i/√2) v2 + (1/√2)v3 =0. Multiply by √2: -i v2 +v3=0. From above, v2= -i v3. Substitute:

-i (-i v3) +v3 = (i^2) v3 +v3= (-1) v3 +v3=0. So, equations are consistent.

Therefore, eigenvector for λ=0 is any vector with v1=0, v2= -i v3, and v3 arbitrary. Let u is v3; so eigenvector is [0, -i u, u]^T. Normalizing, choose u=1. But then the norm squared is 0 + | -i |^2*U^2 + |u|^2=0 +1 +1=2. Hence, normalized as [0, -i/√2,1/√2]^T.

Now, projection of |ψ> onto this eigenvector.

ψ is [1/6, 0, 4/6]^T

The inner product <v | ψ> where v is [0, i/√2,1/√2], but wait, no:

Wait, wait. The eigenvector we computed is [0, -i,1]^T. Normalized as [0, -i/√2,1/√2]. Let me check.

But given the eigenvalue problem, no, we found v1=0, v2=-iv3, and choosing v3=1 gives v=[0,-i,1]^T, with norm √(0 +1 +1)=√2, so normalized [0, -i/√2,1/√2].

Wait, I had earlier for the eigenvalue √2 another eigenvector [0, i,1]/√2, so this [0, -i,1]/√2 is orthogonal to that?

Yes. [0, i,1]^T and [0, -i,1]^T would have inner product 0*(0) + (i)(-i) +1*1 = (i*(-i))= +1 +1=2. Hmm, wait, but the normalized versions would be [0,i/√2,1/sqrt2], [0,-i/√2,1/sqrt2], inner product:

 (0)(0) + (i/√2)( -i /√2 ) + (1/√2)(1 /√2) = ( (-i^2)/2 ) + (1/2) ) = (1 /2 +1/2 )=1. Wait, that's not orthogonal. Therefore, contradiction.

But the eigenvectors for different eigenvalues should be orthogonal. Wait, λ=√2 and λ=0. So eigenvector for λ=0 is [0, -i,1], let me compute inner product with e1 and e2.

Let's compute <e1 | v_0 > where v_0 = [0, -i/sqrt2,1/sqrt2]. This is zero. Compute <e2 | v_0> where e2 = [0,i/sqrt2,1/sqrt2]. The inner product is (conj of e2) ⋅ v0 = 0*0 + (-i/sqrt2)*( - i /sqrt2 ) + (1/sqrt2)*(1/sqrt2) = [ (-i)(-i) ] /2 +1/2 = [ (-1) ] /2 +1/2 =0. Therefore, orthogonal. Good.

So yes, v0= [0,-i/sqrt2,1/sqrt2]^T, and it's orthogonal to both e1 and e2.

Therefore, now, to find the projection onto the eigenspace of λ=0. Since 0 is non-degenerate, the projector is |v0><v0|.

So the inner product <v0 | ψ> is:

(0)*(1/6) + (i/sqrt2)*(0) + (1/sqrt2)*(4/6) = 4/(6 sqrt2)=2/(3 sqrt2)=sqrt2/3.

Therefore, |<v0 |ψ>|2= (sqrt2/3)^2=2/9. Dividing by ||ψ||2=17/36 gives:

Probability for eigenvalue 0 is (2/9)/(17/36)= 8/17.

Wait, so probability for eigenvalue sqrt2: as previously, 9/17; eigenvalue 0:8/17. But these answer options don't list that. Wait, answer choice D says "probabilities are 8/17 and 1/17". Maybe the question is not summarizing the probabilities for different eigenvalues but the probabilities for each eigenvectors for the degenerate eigenvalue √2. So for the eigenvalue sqrt2, which has degenerate eigenvectors (e1 and e2), the probabilities for each would be 1/17 and 8/17, total 9/17. Then eigenvalue 0 would have probability 8/17. This is consistent. So answer choice D would list the degenerate eigenvalue sqrt2, and the probabilities (for each eigenvector) 1/17 and 8/17. But in measurement, you would get sqrt2 with probability 9/17 and 0 with probability 8/17. However, the question says:

"What are the degenerate eigenvalue and the corresponding degeneracy? What are the probabilities of obtaining those degenerate eigenvalues at any measurement?"

There might be confusion. "Probabilities of obtaining those degenerate eigenvalues"—i.e., the probability of getting sqrt2 with its degeneracy (which is a single probability:9/17), but let's check answer options.

Looking at options:

(A) degenerate eigenvalue is 0: nope. (B) sqrt3: no. (C) 2:no. (D) sqrt2, degeneracy 2, probabilities (8/17 and 1/17). Those probabilities for the eigenvalue... sqrt2 probability is sum=9/17. But maybe the problem is referring to an ambiguous question. But answer D's probabilities are for...? If degeneracy is 2, then upon measuring, you would collapse into one of the two eigenvectors, and those have probabilities 1/17 and8/17. So I think D is correct. Since answer D lists degenerate eigenvalue sqrt2, degeneracy 2, and their probabilities as1/17 and8/17. And the total for eigenvalue sqrt2 would be sum of the two, but the question separates them. But answer C has both probabilities as8/17, which would exceed the state vector's total 17/36 normalized.

 Alternatively, check probabilities:

For the eigenvector e1: [1/6,0,4/6] projected onto e1 gives 1/6, squared is1/36. Probability is |1/6|^2 divided by ||ψ||^2 , which is (1/36) / (17/36)=1/17.

For e2: (1/6,0,4/6) projected onto [0, i/√2,1/√2]. The inner product is sqrt2/3, squared gives2/9, / (17/36)=8/17. Hence, probabilities 1/17 and8/17.

Adding these gives9/17 for eigenvalue sqrt2 and8/17 for eigenvalue 0, which matches but in answer choices, the degeneracy probabilities are in option D as8/17 and1/17. So as separate probabilities for each eigenvector, hence answer D is the correct one. Thus, the correct Answer should be D.

**Final Answer**

<explanation>The solver checks for orthogonality between eigenvectors and initially makes an error in the calculation, but then recognizes the issue and proceeds to correct it in subsequent steps.</explanation>

<start>8237</start>
<end>8510</end>
<text>Hmm, wait, but the normalized versions would be [0,i/√2,1/sqrt2], [0,-i/√2,1/sqrt2], inner product:

 (0)(0) + (i/√2)( -i /√2 ) + (1/√2)(1 /√2) = ( (-i^2)/2 ) + (1/2) ) = (1 /2 +1/2 )=1. Wait, that's not orthogonal. Therefore, contradiction.</text>

<start>9188</start>
<end>9371</end>
<text>But in quantum mechanics, the total probability is 9/17. But the options have two probabilities for the degenerate eigenvalues, so perhaps the problem is asking for the individual probabilities when measuring P</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates understanding of how degenerate eigenvalues work in quantum measurements, recognizing that while the total probability for an eigenvalue is the sum of projections onto its eigenspace, the problem might be asking for individual probabilities associated with specific eigenvectors.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver clearly identifies the two main components of the problem: finding the degenerate eigenvalue with its degeneracy, and then calculating the associated measurement probabilities, establishing a logical sequence for solving the problem.</explanation>

<start>5970</start>
<end>6142</end>
<text>First, we need to find the eigenvectors for the eigenvalue √2, which is degenerate.

So, need to find the eigenvectors for the eigenvalue √2. Then, the probability is the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto each eigenvector</text>

<start>7460</start>
<end>7644</end>
<text>Therefore, the projectors onto these eigenvectors are |e1><e1| and |e2><e2|.

<text>det = (1/√2 - λ)(1/√2 - λ) - (i/√2)(-i/√2)

Multiply that out. Let's compute the second term:

(-i/√2)(i/√2) = (-i^2)/(√2 * √2) = (-(-1))/2 = 1/2</text>
<explanation>The solver performs a detailed calculation of the determinant, correctly manipulating complex numbers and simplifying the expression to determine the value of a specific term in the determinant.</explanation>

<start>4252</start>
<end>4456</end>
<text>1/√2 - λ = ±1/√2

Thus:

Case 1: 1/√2 - λ = 1/√2 → λ = 0

Case 2: 1/√2 - λ = -1/√2 → λ = 1/√2 + 1/√2 = 2/√2 = √2</text>

<text>First row: [√2, 0, 0]

Second row: [0, 1/√2, i/√2]

Third row: [0, -i/√2, 1/√2]

Now, the conjugate transpose P† would be:

First row: [√2, 0, 0]

Second row: [0, 1/√2, -i/√2]

Third row: [0, i/√2, 1/√2]</text>
<explanation>The solver correctly computes the conjugate transpose of the matrix P by taking the complex conjugate of each element and transposing the matrix, demonstrating accurate computation with complex numbers.</explanation>

<skill>Hypothesis Testing and Verification</skill>
<definition>The ability to formulate hypotheses about potential solutions, test them against given constraints or conditions, and verify their validity through logical reasoning or calculation.</definition>
<start>6878</start>
<end>7159</end>
<text>Compare with original P. Second and third rows:

Original Second row: [0, 1/√2, i/√2]; third row: [0, -i/√2, 1/√2]

So the original P and P† differ in those entries. For matrix to Hermitian, those should be the same, but swapping the off-diagonal terms and conjugating. Indeed, the (2,3) entry of P is i/√2, and (3,2) is -i/√2. The conjugate of (2,3) entry would be -i/√2, which is equal to the (3,2) entry. Similarly, the (3,2) entry of P is -i/√2; its conjugate is i/√2, which is the (2,3) entry of P. So yes, P is equal to its conjugate transpose. Therefore, P is Hermitian.</text>
<explanation>The solver formulates the hypothesis that P is Hermitian, then systematically tests this by comparing the original matrix with its conjugate transpose, carefully examining corresponding elements to verify that the matrix satisfies the definition of a Hermitian operator.</explanation>

<start>9913</start>
<end>10238</end>
<text>Looking at options:

(A) degenerate eigenvalue is 0: nope. (B) sqrt3: no. (C) 2:no. (D) sqrt2, degeneracy 2, probabilities (8/17 and 1/17). Those probabilities for the eigenvalue... sqrt2 probability is sum=9/17. But maybe the problem is referring to an ambiguous question. But answer D's probabilities are for...? If degeneracy is 2, then upon measuring, you would collapse into one of the two eigenvectors, and those have probabilities 1/17 and8/17. So I think D is correct.</text>
<explanation>The solver tests each answer choice against the calculated results, systematically eliminating incorrect options and verifying that option D matches both the identified degenerate eigenvalue (√2) with degeneracy 2 and the calculated probabilities (1/17 and 8/17).</explanation>

<start>10239</start>
<end>10462</end>
<text>Since answer D lists degenerate eigenvalue sqrt2, degeneracy 2, and their probabilities as1/17 and8/17. And the total for eigenvalue sqrt2 would be sum of the two, but the question separates them. But answer C has both probabilities as8/17, which would exceed the state vector's total 17/36 normalized.</text>
<explanation>The solver further verifies the validity of option D by checking that the sum of probabilities is consistent with quantum mechanical principles, while also confirming that option C would lead to an inconsistency in the total probability.</explanation>
