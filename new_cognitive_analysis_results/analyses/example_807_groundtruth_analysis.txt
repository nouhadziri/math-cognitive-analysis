Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
[0.8, 0.0, 0.6]

Analysis:
I need to analyze the cognitive skills in the provided solution, but I notice that the "thinking trajectory" provided is only the final answer [0.8, 0.0, 0.6] without showing the detailed problem-solving steps. Since I don't have the actual thinking process to analyze, I'll need to infer what cognitive skills would be required to arrive at this answer.

<text>[0.8, 0.0, 0.6]</text>
<explanation>To arrive at this answer, the solver needed to retrieve knowledge about binormal vectors in 3D space. Specifically, they needed to know that the binormal vector B is defined as B = T × N, where T is the unit tangent vector and N is the unit normal vector. This knowledge is essential for solving the problem, even though we don't see the explicit retrieval in the trajectory.</explanation>

<end>16</end>
<text>[0.8, 0.0, 0.6]</text>
<explanation>To find the binormal vector, the solver would have needed to calculate the derivative of r(t) to find the tangent vector, then normalize it to get the unit tangent vector T. Then they would need to find the derivative of T and normalize it to get the unit normal vector N. Finally, they would compute the cross product T × N to get the binormal vector. The final answer [0.8, 0.0, 0.6] suggests they correctly applied these vector calculus operations.</explanation>

<text>[0.8, 0.0, 0.6]</text>
<explanation>The solver arrived at the specific numerical values [0.8, 0.0, 0.6], which indicates they performed the necessary calculations accurately. This would involve computing derivatives, normalizing vectors (which requires calculating magnitudes), and performing cross products - all of which require precise computation.</explanation>

<start>0</start>

<text>[0.8, 0.0, 0.6]</text>
<explanation>The solver understood the formal notation r(t) = (6t+2)i + 5t^2j - 8tk and correctly interpreted what it means to find a binormal vector expressed as [xi, yj, zk]. They were able to translate between different mathematical representations and follow the formal rules for vector operations.</explanation>

<start>0</start>
<end>16</end>
<text>[0.8, 0.0, 0.6]</text>
<explanation>To find the binormal vector, the solver would have needed to decompose the problem into steps: (1) find r'(t), (2) compute T = r'(t)/|r'(t)|, (3) find T'(t), (4) compute N = T'(t)/|T'(t)|, and (5) calculate B = T × N. The final answer suggests they successfully decomposed and solved these sub-problems.</explanation>
