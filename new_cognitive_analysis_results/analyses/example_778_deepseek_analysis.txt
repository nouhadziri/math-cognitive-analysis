Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to find the sum from k=0 to infinity of the floor of (1 + sqrt(2000000 divided by 4^k))/2. Hmm. Let me try to parse this and figure out how to approach it.

First, let's write out the general term of the summation: for each integer k ≥ 0, we calculate floor[(1 + sqrt(2000000 / 4^k)) / 2]. Then we sum all those terms from k=0 to infinity. The challenge is to compute this infinite sum.

Let me start by simplifying the expression inside the floor function. The term inside is (1 + sqrt(2000000 / 4^k)) / 2. Let's consider how this expression behaves as k increases. Since 4^k grows exponentially, the term 2000000 / 4^k will decrease rapidly, approaching zero as k approaches infinity. Therefore, sqrt(2000000 / 4^k) will also decrease, approaching zero. So, the numerator (1 + sqrt(...)) will approach 1, and dividing by 2 gives us 0.5. Since the floor of 0.5 is 0, once the expression inside the floor is less than 1, the term becomes 0. Therefore, the terms will eventually become zero, so the infinite sum is actually a finite sum up to some k where 2000000 / 4^k is still large enough to make the expression inside the floor at least 1.

So, my first step is to determine for which values of k the term inside the floor is at least 1. Because once it's less than 1, the floor function will make it zero, and those terms can be ignored. Let's set up the inequality:

(1 + sqrt(2000000 / 4^k)) / 2 ≥ 1

Multiply both sides by 2:

1 + sqrt(2000000 / 4^k) ≥ 2

Subtract 1:

sqrt(2000000 / 4^k) ≥ 1

Square both sides:

2000000 / 4^k ≥ 1

Which implies:

4^k ≤ 2000000

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

k * ln(4) ≤ ln(2000000)

So,

k ≤ ln(2000000)/ln(4)

Compute that numerically. Let me calculate ln(2000000). Remember ln(2000000) = ln(2*10^6) = ln(2) + 6*ln(10)

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.693147, ln(10) ≈ 2.302585. Therefore, ln(2000000) ≈ 0.693147 + 6*2.302585 ≈ 0.693147 + 13.81551 ≈ 14.508657. Then ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2 ln(2) ≈ 1.386294.

So,

k ≤ 14.508657 / 1.386294 ≈ let me compute this division. 14.508657 ÷ 1.386294 ≈ 10.47 approximately. So, since k has to be an integer, the maximum k where 4^k ≤ 2000000 is k=10, because 4^10 = 1,048,576, which is less than 2,000,000. Then 4^11 = 4,194,304, which exceeds 2,000,000. Therefore, the terms for k from 0 to 10 could be non-zero, and for k ≥ 11, the term is zero. Therefore, the summation effectively is from k=0 to k=10.

So, the sum can be written as the sum from k=0 to 10 of floor[(1 + sqrt(2000000 / 4^k)) / 2]. Thus, my task reduces to computing these 11 terms and adding them up.

However, even computing each term individually might be time-consuming, but maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help. Alternatively, use properties of the floor function and the expression.

Wait, let's note that each term in the sum is floor[(1 + sqrt(N / 4^k)) / 2], where N is 2,000,000. Maybe this is equivalent to counting something that decreases by a factor of 2 each time? Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps this relates to counting lattice points or something with Pythagorean triples? The expression (1 + sqrt(M)) / 2 and taking the floor could relate to some Diophantine equation?

Alternatively, perhaps the expression resembles the formula for the number of solutions to some equation. Let me see.

Wait, if I let x be an integer such that x ≤ (1 + sqrt(M)) / 2 < x + 1. Then the floor would be x. But does this x correspond to anything?

Perhaps, in Pythagorean triples, for a given hypotenuse, the number of legs (a, b) with a ≤ b. Wait, in that case, for a given hypotenuse c, the number of pairs (a, b) with a^2 + b^2 = c^2 and a ≤ b. Maybe that's relevant here, but maybe not.

Wait, actually, our expression inside the floor is (1 + sqrt(2,000,000 / 4^k)) / 2. Let's substitute variables to make this clearer.

Let me denote M = 2,000,000.

Then each term is floor[(1 + sqrt(M / 4^k)) / 2]

Let me define M_k = M / 4^k. Then the term is floor[(1 + sqrt(M_k)) / 2]

Note that M_k = 2,000,000 / 4^k. We need to compute floor[(1 + sqrt(M_k)) / 2] for k from 0 to 10.

Let me notice that sqrt(M / 4^k) = sqrt(M) / 2^k.

Since sqrt(2,000,000) is sqrt(2 * 10^6) = sqrt(2) * 10^3 ≈ 1.4142 * 1000 ≈ 1414.21. Therefore, sqrt(M) ≈ 1414.21.

Therefore, sqrt(M_k) = sqrt(M) / 2^k ≈ 1414.21 / 2^k. Therefore, the expression (1 + sqrt(M_k)) / 2 ≈ (1 + 1414.21 / 2^k) / 2. So, as k increases, this term decreases.

But we need exact values, not approximations. So, maybe calculate sqrt(2000000 / 4^k) exactly for each k, then compute (1 + that sqrt)/2, then take the floor. Let's see.

First, let me compute sqrt(2000000 / 4^k). Since 4^k = (2^2)^k = 2^(2k). Therefore, 2000000 / 4^k = 2000000 / 2^(2k) = 2000000 * 2^(-2k). But sqrt(2000000 * 2^(-2k)) = sqrt(2000000) * 2^(-k). Since sqrt(ab) = sqrt(a)sqrt(b) and sqrt(2^(-2k)) = 2^(-k). Therefore, sqrt(2000000 / 4^k) = sqrt(2000000) / 2^k.

Wait a second! sqrt(a / b) is equal to sqrt(a)/sqrt(b), so this is correct.

So, sqrt(2000000 / 4^k) = sqrt(2000000) / 2^k.

Thus, sqrt(2000000) is the same as sqrt(2*10^6) = sqrt(2)*10^3. Let's compute sqrt(2000000):

sqrt(2000000) = sqrt(2000000) = sqrt(2 * 1000000) = sqrt(2) * 1000 ≈ 1.41421356237 * 1000 = 1414.21356237. So, approximately 1414.21356237. So, that's irrational, non-integer. Hence, when we compute sqrt(2000000) / 2^k, the result is 1414.21356237... / 2^k.

Therefore, the term (1 + sqrt(2000000) / 2^k)/2. We need to take the floor of that.

So, for each k from 0 to 10, the expressions will be (1 + 1414.21356237... / 2^k)/2. Then we take the floor.

Wait, but as this is problem likely has a smart solution rather than brute-forcing each term, let me think again.

Given that the original problem is sum_{k=0}^{infty} floor[(1 + sqrt(2000000 / 4^k)) / 2]. Maybe there's a way to interpret this expression. Let me attempt to express it more simply.

Since floor[(1 + x)/2] for x ≥ 0 corresponds to floor[(x + 1)/2]. The floor of (x + 1)/2 is equivalent to the ceiling of (x)/2. Wait, let's test some values.

Wait, for example, if x = 2.5, then (x + 1)/2 = 1.75, floor(1.75) = 1. Alternatively, ceiling(x/2) = ceiling(1.25) = 2. Not the same. So, different. Not equivalent.

But maybe it's the floor((x + 1)/2). How does this relate to floor(x/2) or ceil(x/2)?

For even x: let me say x is an even integer, say x=2n. Then (2n +1)/2 = n + 0.5, the floor is n.

If x is an odd integer, x=2n+1. Then (2n+2)/2 = n+1, floor is n+1.

But x here is not an integer in general. Wait, sqrt(2000000 /4^k) may or may not be integer. But given that 2,000,000 is 2 * 10^6 = 2* (2*5)^6 = 2^7*5^6. Then sqrt(2000000) = sqrt(2^7*5^6) = 2^(3.5)*5^3 = 2^3*sqrt(2)*5^3 = 8*125*sqrt(2) = 1000*sqrt(2). Wait, wait, yes! That's exact.

Wait: 2000000 is 2 * 10^6 = 2 * (2*5)^6 = 2 * 2^6 * 5^6 = 2^7 * 5^6.

Therefore, sqrt(2000000) = sqrt(2^7 *5^6) = 2^(7/2)*5^(6/2) = 2^3.5 *5^3 = 2^3 * 2^0.5 *5^3 = 8 * 5^3 * sqrt(2) = 8*125*sqrt(2) = 1000*sqrt(2). So sqrt(2000000) is exactly 1000*sqrt(2). Ah, that's a key insight. Therefore, for each k, sqrt(2000000 /4^k) is sqrt(2000000)/2^k = 1000*sqrt(2)/2^k.

So, sqrt(2000000 /4^k) = 1000*sqrt(2)/2^k. Then the term inside the floor becomes [1 + 1000*sqrt(2)/2^k]/2.

So, rearranged, this is [1/2 + (1000*sqrt(2)/2)/2^k]. Wait, simplifying, that's 0.5 + (1000*sqrt(2)/2)/2^k.

But maybe not particularly helpful. However, knowing that sqrt(2000000) is exactly 1000*sqrt(2) is useful because now we can represent these terms in terms of sqrt(2). However, because sqrt(2) is irrational, the term inside is irrational until divided by 2^k. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a telescoping series here, or a relationship between subsequent terms. Let's test some values. Let me compute terms k=0 to k=10 and see.

Compute for each k, the value of sqrt(2000000 /4^k) = 1000*sqrt(2)/2^k. Then compute (1 + that)/2, then take floor.

Starting with k=0:

sqrt(2000000 /1) = sqrt(2000000) = 1000*sqrt(2) ≈ 1414.21356237

Then (1 + 1414.21356237)/2 ≈ (1415.21356237)/2 ≈ 707.606781185. The floor is 707.

Wait, floor(707.60678) = 707.

Wait, let me confirm that 1000*sqrt(2) is ~1414.21356237, then +1 is ~1415.21356237, divided by 2 is ~707.606781185. The floor is 707.

For k=0, term is 707.

k=1:

sqrt(2000000 /4^1) = sqrt(500000). sqrt(500000) = sqrt(5 *10^5) = sqrt(5)*sqrt(10^5) = sqrt(5)*(10^(2.5))... Hmm, but wait sqrt(500000) = sqrt(2000000 /4) = sqrt(2000000)/2 = 1000*sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 707.106781187.

Therefore, [1 + 707.106781187]/2 ≈ (708.106781187)/2 ≈ 354.05339. The floor is 354.

k=1 term is 354.

k=2:

sqrt(2000000 / 16) = sqrt(125000) = sqrt(125 * 1000) = sqrt(125)*sqrt(1000) = 5*sqrt(5)*10*sqrt(10) = approximates to 5*2.236*10*3.162 ≈ but more directly sqrt(125000)= 353.553390593. So, sqrt(125000)=353.553390593.

Then [1 + 353.553390593]/2 ≈ 354.553390593 /2 ≈177.276695296. Floor is 177.

k=2 term is 177.

k=3:

2000000 / 64 = 31250. sqrt(31250) = sqrt(31250) = sqrt(625 *50) = 25*sqrt(50) =25*5*sqrt(2)=125*1.4142≈176.7767. Hmm, exact?

Wait, 25*sqrt(50) =25*sqrt(25*2) =25*5*sqrt(2)=125*sqrt(2)≈125*1.41421356≈176.77669.

Then [1 + 176.77669]/2≈177.77669/2≈88.888345. Floor is 88.

k=3 term is 88.

k=4:

2000000 / 256 = 7812.5. sqrt(7812.5). Let's compute that. 7812.5=625*12.5, sqrt(625*12.5)=25*sqrt(12.5)=25*3.5355339≈88.3883475. So [1 +88.3883475]/2 ≈89.3883475 /2≈44.69417375. Floor is 44.

k=4 term is 44.

k=5:

2000000 /1024 =≈1953.125. sqrt(1953.125). sqrt(1953.125). Let's note that 44^2=1936, 45^2=2025. So sqrt(1953.125)≈44.2185. Then [1 +44.2185]/2≈45.2185/2≈22.60925. Floor is 22.

But exact computation:

sqrt(2000000 / 4^5) = sqrt(2000000 / 1024)= sqrt(1953.125). Alternatively, using our formula: sqrt(2000000)/2^5≈1414.21356/32≈44.194176. Then (1 +44.194176)/2≈45.194176 /2≈22.597088. Floor is 22.

So k=5 term is 22.

k=6: 2000000 /4^6 =2000000 /4096=488.28125.

sqrt(488.28125) ≈22.0959. So, (1+22.0959)/2≈23.0959/2≈11.54795. Floor is 11.

Compute more precisely: sqrt(488.28125). 22^2=484, 22.1^2=488.41. Thus, sqrt(488.28125)≈22.0945. So (1 +22.0945)/2≈11.54725. Floor=11.

k=6 term is 11.

k=7: 2000000 /4^7=2000000 /16384≈122.0703125

sqrt(122.0703125)≈11.045. Add 1:12.045, divide by2≈6.0225. Floor is 6.

Thus, term for k=7 is 6.

Wait, compute exactly:

sqrt(2000000 /4^7)=1000*sqrt(2)/128≈1000*1.41421356/128≈1414.21356/128≈11.0485. Then (1 +11.0485)/2≈12.0485 /2≈6.02425. Floor is 6.

k=7 term is 6.

k=8:2000000 /4^8=2000000 /65536≈30.517578125

sqrt(30.517578125)≈5.524. Then [1 +5.524]/2≈6.524/2≈3.262. Floor is 3.

But compute exactly: sqrt(30.517578125). Let's note that 5.5^2=30.25, 5.52^2=30.4704, so sqrt(30.517578125)≈5.524. So, (1 +5.524)/2≈3.262, so floor is 3.

k=8 term is 3.

k=9:2000000 /4^9=2000000 /262144≈7.62939453125

sqrt(7.62939453125)≈2.76. (1 +2.76)/2=3.76/2=1.88. Floor is1.

But sqrt(7.62939453125)=sqrt(7.62939453125). Since 2.76^2 is approximately 7.6176, so sqrt≈2.762. So (1 +2.762)/2≈1.881. Floor=1.

k=9 term is1.

k=10:2000000 /4^10=2000000 /1048576≈1.9073486328125

sqrt(1.9073486328125)≈1.3808. (1 +1.3808)/2≈2.3808 /2≈1.1904. Floor=1.

But wait: sqrt(1.9073486328125). Since 1.38^2=1.9044, which is close. So sqrt≈1.38, then (1 +1.38)/2=1.19, floor=1.

k=10 term is1.

What about k=11? As we discussed earlier, k=11 would give 2000000 /4^11≈0.476837...sqrt≈0.6905. Then (1+0.6905)/2≈0.84525, whose floor is 0. Thus, term is 0. So from k=11 onward, terms are zero. Therefore, our sum is from k=0 to k=10.

Now, let's tally the computed terms:

k=0: 707

k=1: 354

k=2:177

k=3:88

k=4:44

k=5:22

k=6:11

k=7:6

k=8:3

k=9:1

k=10:1

Let me check these numbers again, for example, k=9 term was approx1.88... floor=1, yes. k=10 is≈1.1904, floor 1. Okay.

Now sum these up.

Let me sum them step by step:

Start with 707.

Add 354: 707 + 354 = 1061

Add 177: 1061 + 177 = 1238

Add 88: 1238 + 88 = 1326

Add 44: 1326 + 44 = 1370

Add 22: 1370 +22 =1392

Add 11:1392 +11=1403

Add6:1403+6=1409

Add3:1409+3=1412

Add1:1412 +1=1413

Add1(final term k=10):1413+1=1414

Wait, hold on: Wait, from the terms listed:

k=0:707

k=1:354

k=2:177

k=3:88

k=4:44

k=5:22

k=6:11

k=7:6

k=8:3

k=9:1

k=10:1

So that's 11 terms. Let's check:

Starting with 0:707

After adding k=1 (354):707+354=1061. Correct.

k=2 (177):1061+177=1238

k=3 (88):1238+88=1326

k=4 (44):1326+44=1370

k=5 (22):1370+22=1392

k=6 (11):1392+11=1403

k=7 (6):1403+6=1409

k=8 (3):1409+3=1412

k=9 (1):1412+1=1413

k=10 (1):1413+1=1414

So total sum is 1414.

Therefore, according to my calculations, the sum from k=0 to k=10 gives a total of 1414.

But wait, before trusting that, I must cross-check. The process involved approximating the sqrt terms, then flooring. However, when dealing with floor functions, especially with irrational numbers that are close to integers, there's a chance of error if the approximation was slightly off.

Let me verify each term more carefully.

Starting with k=0:

sqrt(2000000/4^0) = sqrt(2000000)=1000*sqrt(2) ≈ 1414.21356237.

(1 + 1414.21356237)/2 ≈ 707.60678118. floor=707. Correct.

k=1: sqrt(2000000/4)=sqrt(500000)=≈707.10678118. (1 +707.10678118)/2≈354.05339. floor=354.

But 707.10678118 divided by 2 is 353.55339, plus 0.5 gives 354.05339? Wait, wait, no: (1 + x)/2 where x=707.10678118. Then 1 + x=708.10678118; divided by 2=354.05339059. Floor is 354. Correct.

k=1 term is 354.

k=2:sqrt(2000000 /16)=sqrt(125000)=≈353.55339059. (1 +353.55339059)/2≈354.55339059/2≈177.27669529. Floor=177.

Wait, 353.55339059... adding 1 is 354.55339059..., divided by 2, as you said, is 177.27669... So, floor=177. Correct.

k=2 term is 177. Correct.

k=3: sqrt(2000000 / 64)=sqrt(31250)=≈176.7767...(as established earlier). (1 +176.7767)/2≈177.7767/2≈88.8883. Floor=88. Correct.

k=4: sqrt(2000000 /256)=sqrt(7812.5)=≈88.3883476... (1 +88.3883476)/2≈89.3883476/2≈44.6941738. Floor=44. Correct.

k=5: sqrt(2000000 /1024)=sqrt(1953.125)=≈44.19417382... (1 +44.19417382)/2≈45.19417382/2≈22.59708691. Floor=22.

Wait, so here sqrt(1953.125)=sqrt(2000000 /1024)=approximately 44.194. Thus, adding 1:45.194 divided by2=22.597. Floor=22. Correct.

k=5 term=22.

k=6: sqrt(2000000 / 4096)=sqrt(488.28125). 4096*4^6 right?

Wait, 4^6=4096, correct. sqrt(2000000 /4096) =sqrt(488.28125)=≈22.0945. So (1 +22.0945)/2=23.0945/2≈11.547. Floor=11. Correct.

k=6 term=11.

k=7: sqrt(2000000 /16384)=sqrt(122.0703125)≈11.045. So (1+11.045)/2≈6.0225. Floor=6. Correct.

k=7 term=6.

k=8: sqrt(2000000 /65536)=sqrt(30.517578125)≈5.524. So (1 +5.524)/2≈3.262. Floor=3.

Check that sqrt(30.517578125). 5.5^2=30.25, so sqrt≈5.524. Correct. So floor is3.

k=8 term=3.

k=9: sqrt(2000000 /262144)=sqrt(2000000 /262144)=sqrt(7.62939453125)=2.762.

(1 +2.762)/2=1.881. Floor=1. Correct.

k=9 term=1.

k=10: sqrt(2000000 /1048576)=sqrt(1.9073486328125)≈1.3808.

(1+1.3808)/2≈2.3808/2≈1.1904. Floor=1. Correct.

All these terms check out. Therefore, summing them as above:707+354+177+88+44+22+11+6+3+1+1=1414.

Therefore, the final answer is 1414.

Wait, but the problem says find this sum. Let me recall that in these types of problems, is there a smarter way rather than term-by-term computation? Maybe linked to the binary expansion or digit counts? But given the nature of the terms and the exponential decay with each k, term-by-term seems the only way. However, summing these up as done here seems okay.

But double-checking once more:

List of terms:

707,354,177,88,44,22,11,6,3,1,1

Adding in pairs:

707 + 354 = 1061

1061 +177 = 1238

1238 +88=1326

1326 +44=1370

1370 +22=1392

1392 +11=1403

1403 +6=1409

1409 +3=1412

1412 +1=1413

1413 +1=1414

Yup, total is 1414.

Hence, my answer is 1414.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1414}

# Analysis of Cognitive Skills in Mathematical Problem-Solving

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify regularities, trends, or recurring elements in data or mathematical expressions, which can lead to insights about the underlying structure of a problem.</definition>

<start>1037</start>
<end>1232</end>
<text>Therefore, the terms will eventually become zero, so the infinite sum is actually a finite sum up to some k where 2000000 / 4^k is still large enough to make the expression inside the floor at least 1.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes a pattern in how the terms will behave as k increases, identifying that the sum is actually finite despite being written as an infinite series. This insight significantly simplifies the problem by converting an infinite sum to a finite one.</explanation>

<start>7373</start>
<end>7563</end>
<text>Therefore, sqrt(2000000) = sqrt(2^7 *5^6) = 2^(7/2)*5^(6/2) = 2^3.5 *5^3 = 2^3 * 2^0.5 *5^3 = 8 * 5^3 * sqrt(2) = 8*125*sqrt(2) = 1000*sqrt(2).</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes a pattern in the prime factorization of 2,000,000 that allows for a clean expression of its square root. This recognition of the number's structure leads to a key insight that simplifies subsequent calculations.</explanation>

<start>12864</start>
<end>13069</end>
<text>k=0: 707
k=1: 354
k=2:177
k=3:88
k=4:44
k=5:22
k=6:11
k=7:6
k=8:3
k=9:1
k=10:1</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes a pattern in the computed values, where each term is approximately half of the previous term (with some variation due to the floor function). This pattern serves as a check on the calculations and helps confirm the approach.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Planning</skill>
<definition>The ability to develop and implement a systematic approach to solving a problem, including breaking down complex problems into manageable steps and choosing appropriate solution methods.</definition>

<start>1233</start>
<end>1495</end>
<text>So, my first step is to determine for which values of k the term inside the floor is at least 1. Because once it's less than 1, the floor function will make it zero, and those terms can be ignored. Let's set up the inequality:

(1 + sqrt(2000000 / 4^k)) / 2 ≥ 1</text>
<explanation>The solver develops a strategic approach by first determining when terms become zero, which allows them to convert the infinite sum to a finite one. This demonstrates planning ahead and breaking down the problem into a logical first step.</explanation>

<start>2896</start>
<end>3047</end>
<text>Therefore, the terms for k from 0 to 10 could be non-zero, and for k ≥ 11, the term is zero. Therefore, the summation effectively is from k=0 to k=10.</text>
<explanation>After working through the inequality, the solver establishes the range of k values needed for calculation, effectively setting up a structured approach to tackle the rest of the problem. This shows strategic planning by defining the scope of the calculation needed.</explanation>

<start>3048</start>
<end>3206</end>
<text>So, the sum can be written as the sum from k=0 to 10 of floor[(1 + sqrt(2000000 / 4^k)) / 2]. Thus, my task reduces to computing these 11 terms and adding them up.</text>
<explanation>The solver outlines the next phase of the solution strategy, showing a clear plan for how to proceed with the calculation now that the range of k values has been determined.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Reformulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to restate a mathematical expression or problem in an equivalent but more tractable form that facilitates solution or insight.</definition>

<start>6605</start>
<end>6787</end>
<text>Let me notice that sqrt(M / 4^k) = sqrt(M) / 2^k.

Since sqrt(2,000,000) is sqrt(2 * 10^6) = sqrt(2) * 10^3 ≈ 1.4142 * 1000 ≈ 1414.21.</text>
<explanation>The solver reformulates the expression by using the property of square roots to simplify the calculation, converting division inside the square root to division outside it. This makes the computation more manageable.</explanation>

<start>7081</start>
<end>7264</end>
<text>First, let me compute sqrt(2000000 / 4^k). Since 4^k = (2^2)^k = 2^(2k). Therefore, 2000000 / 4^k = 2000000 / 2^(2k) = 2000000 * 2^(-2k).</text>
<explanation>The solver reformulates the expression by using properties of exponents to rewrite 4^k in terms of powers of 2, which helps in simplifying the overall expression.</explanation>

<start>7265</start>
<end>7372</end>
<text>But sqrt(2000000 * 2^(-2k)) = sqrt(2000000) * 2^(-k). Since sqrt(ab) = sqrt(a)sqrt(b) and sqrt(2^(-2k)) = 2^(-k).</text>
<explanation>The solver continues the reformulation by applying properties of square roots to further simplify the expression, showing how mathematical expressions can be rewritten in equivalent but more useful forms.</explanation>

<skill>Numerical Computation</skill>
<definition>The ability to perform accurate calculations, including arithmetic operations, working with irrational numbers, and managing approximations appropriately.</definition>

<start>8041</start>
<end>8390</end>
<text>sqrt(2000000 /1) = sqrt(2000000) = 1000*sqrt(2) ≈ 1414.21356237

Then (1 + 1414.21356237)/2 ≈ (1415.21356237)/2 ≈ 707.606781185. The floor is 707.

Wait, floor(707.60678) = 707.

Wait, let me confirm that 1000*sqrt(2) is ~1414.21356237, then +1 is ~1415.21356237, divided by 2 is ~707.606781185. The floor is 707.</text>
<explanation>The solver performs precise numerical calculations, carefully tracking the values and checking the results. They work with the irrational number sqrt(2) and maintain appropriate precision throughout the calculation.</explanation>

<start>8521</start>
<end>8795</end>
<text>sqrt(2000000 /4^1) = sqrt(500000). sqrt(500000) = sqrt(5 *10^5) = sqrt(5)*sqrt(10^5) = sqrt(5)*(10^(2.5))... Hmm, but wait sqrt(500000) = sqrt(2000000 /4) = sqrt(2000000)/2 = 1000*sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 707.106781187.

Therefore, [1 + 707.106781187]/2 ≈ (708.106781187)/2 ≈ 354.05339. The floor is 354.</text>
<explanation>The solver performs careful numerical calculations for k=1, initially starting with a direct approach but then using the reformulated expression. They maintain precision and correctly apply the floor function to the final result.</explanation>

<start>11297</start>
<end>11424</end>
<text>Add 354: 707 + 354 = 1061

Add 177: 1061 + 177 = 1238

Add 88: 1238 + 88 = 1326

Add 44: 1326 + 44 = 1370</text>
<explanation>The solver methodically adds up the terms of the series, performing the arithmetic step by step to ensure accuracy in the final sum. This demonstrates careful numerical computation skills.</explanation>

<skill>Self-Monitoring and Verification</skill>
<definition>The ability to critically evaluate one's own reasoning process, check for errors, and verify the correctness of intermediate and final results.</definition>

<start>11801</start>
<end>12064</end>
<text>Therefore, according to my calculations, the sum from k=0 to k=10 gives a total of 1414.

But wait, before trusting that, I must cross-check. The process involved approximating the sqrt terms, then flooring. However, when dealing with floor functions, especially with irrational numbers that are close to integers, there's a chance of error if the approximation was slightly off.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates self-monitoring by questioning their own result and recognizing potential sources of error in their calculation, particularly with approximations of irrational numbers and the floor function.</explanation>

<start>12065</start>
<end>12158</end>
<text>Let me verify each term more carefully.

Starting with k=0:

sqrt(2000000/4^0) = sqrt(2000000)=1000*sqrt(2) ≈ 1414.21356237.</text>
<explanation>The solver begins a systematic verification process, rechecking each term of the summation to ensure accuracy. This shows a commitment to validating results rather than accepting the first calculation.</explanation>

<start>14027</start>
<end>14294</end>
<text>Wait, but the problem says find this sum. Let me recall that in these types of problems, is there a smarter way rather than term-by-term computation? Maybe linked to the binary expansion or digit counts? But given the nature of the terms and the exponential decay with each k, term-by-term seems the only way.</text>
<explanation>Even after completing the calculation, the solver questions whether there might be a more elegant approach, showing ongoing critical evaluation of their solution method. This demonstrates metacognitive awareness during problem-solving.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to transform and rearrange mathematical expressions using algebraic rules and properties to simplify or solve equations.</definition>

<start>1496</start>
<end>1750</end>
<text>Multiply both sides by 2:

1 + sqrt(2000000 / 4^k) ≥ 2

Subtract 1:

sqrt(2000000 / 4^k) ≥ 1

Square both sides:

2000000 / 4^k ≥ 1

Which implies:

4^k ≤ 2000000</text>
<explanation>The solver performs a series of algebraic transformations to simplify the inequality, including multiplication, subtraction, and squaring both sides. Each step follows algebraic rules to maintain equivalence while making the expression easier to work with.</explanation>

<start>1751</start>
<end>1911</end>
<text>Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

k * ln(4) ≤ ln(2000000)

So,

k ≤ ln(2000000)/ln(4)</text>
<explanation>The solver continues the algebraic manipulation by applying logarithms to both sides of the inequality and then isolating the variable k. This demonstrates understanding of how to use logarithms to solve exponential inequalities.</explanation>

<start>7564</start>
<end>7744</end>
<text>So sqrt(2000000) is exactly 1000*sqrt(2). Ah, that's a key insight. Therefore, for each k, sqrt(2000000 /4^k) is sqrt(2000000)/2^k = 1000*sqrt(2)/2^k.</text>
<explanation>After finding the exact form of sqrt(2000000), the solver uses algebraic manipulation to express the general term of the series in a cleaner form, which facilitates subsequent calculations.</explanation>
