Problem:

Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
To determine whether there exists a finite group \( G \) with a normal subgroup \( H \) such that \( |\text{Aut } H| > |\text{Aut } G| \), we will construct a specific example and verify the conditions.

1. **Define the Group \( G \)**:
   Let \( G \) be the group generated by elements \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{2n}, y \) under the following relations:
   \[
   x_i x_j = x_j x_i \quad \text{for all } i, j
   \]
   \[
   x_i^2 = y^2 = 1 \quad \text{for all } i
   \]
   \[
   y x_i = x_{i+n} y \quad \text{for all } i \quad (\text{indices taken modulo } 2n)
   \]

2. **Verify the Group Structure**:
   The elements of \( G \) can be written as \( x_{i_1} x_{i_2} \cdots x_{i_k} \) and \( y x_{i_1} x_{i_2} \cdots x_{i_k} \). The product is associative due to the commutativity of the \( x_i \)'s and the given relations.

3. **Define the Subgroup \( H \)**:
   Let \( H \) be the subgroup generated by \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{2n} \). This subgroup is isomorphic to \( \mathbb{Z}_2^{2n} \).

4. **Calculate \( |\text{Aut } H| \)**:
   The automorphism group of \( \mathbb{Z}_2^{2n} \) is isomorphic to the general linear group \( \text{GL}(2n, \mathbb{Z}_2) \). The order of \( \text{GL}(2n, \mathbb{Z}_2) \) is given by:
   \[
   |\text{Aut } H| = |\text{GL}(2n, \mathbb{Z}_2)| = (2^{2n} - 1)(2^{2n} - 2)(2^{2n} - 4) \cdots (2^{2n} - 2^{2n-1})
   \]

5. **Calculate \( |\text{Aut } G| \)**:
   Since \( H \) is the only subgroup of index 2 in \( G \), any automorphism \( f \in \text{Aut } G \) must map \( H \) to itself. The elements \( y \) and \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) generate \( G \), so the automorphisms of \( G \) are determined by their action on these generators. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   |\text{Aut } G| \leq 2^{2n} (2^{2n} - 1) (2^{2n} - 2) \cdots (2^{2n} - 2^n)
   \]

6. **Compare \( |\text{Aut } H| \) and \( |\text{Aut } G| \)**:
   For large \( n \), the order of \( \text{Aut } H \) grows faster than the order of \( \text{Aut } G \). Specifically, the additional factor of \( 2^{2n} \) in the upper bound for \( |\text{Aut } G| \) does not compensate for the difference in the number of terms in the product.

Conclusion:
Thus, for sufficiently large \( n \), we have \( |\text{Aut } H| > |\text{Aut } G| \). This provides an example of a finite group \( G \) with a normal subgroup \( H \) such that \( |\text{Aut } H| > |\text{Aut } G| \).

The final answer is \( \boxed{|\text{Aut } H| > |\text{Aut } G|} \)

<explanation>The solver compares the growth rates of |Aut H| and |Aut G| as n increases, recognizing that despite the additional factor in |Aut G|, the expression for |Aut H| ultimately grows faster due to having more terms in the product.
