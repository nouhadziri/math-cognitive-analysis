Problem:
How many functions $f:\{0,1\}^{3} \rightarrow\{0,1\}$ satisfy the property that, for all ordered triples \left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}\right) and \left(b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}\right) such that $a_{i} \geq b_{i}$ for all $i, f\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}\right) \geq f\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}\right)$?

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Consider the unit cube with vertices $\{0,1\}^{3}$. Let $O=(0,0,0), A=(1,0,0), B=(0,1,0), C=(0,0,1)$, $D=(0,1,1), E=(1,0,1), F=(1,1,0)$, and $P=(1,1,1)$. We want to find a function $f$ on these vertices such that $f(1, y, z) \geq f(0, y, z)$ (and symmetric representations). For instance, if $f(A)=1$, then $f(E)=f(F)=f(P)=1$ as well, and if $f(D)=1$, then $f(P)=1$ as well. We group the vertices into four levels: $L_{0}=\{O\}, L_{1}=\{A, B, C\}, L_{2}=\{D, E, F\}$, and $L_{3}=\{P\}$. We do casework on the lowest level of a 1 in a function. - If the 1 is in $L_{0}$, then $f$ maps everything to 1, for a total of 1 way. - If the 1 is in $L_{1}$, then $f(O)=0$. If there are 31 's in $L_{1}$, then everything but $O$ must be mapped to 1, for 1 way. If there are 21 's in $L_{1}$, then $f\left(L_{2}\right)=f\left(L_{3}\right)=1$, and there are 3 ways to choose the 21 's in $L_{1}$, for a total of 3 ways. If there is one 1, then WLOG $f(A)=1$. Then $f(E)=f(F)=f(P)=1$, and $f(D)$ equals either 0 or 1. There are $3 \cdot 2=6$ ways to do this. In total, there are $1+3+6=10$ ways for the lowest 1 to be in $L_{1}$. - If the lowest 1 is in $L_{2}$, then $f(O)=f\left(L_{1}\right)=0$. If there are 31 's in $L_{2}$, there is one way to make $f$. If there are 21 's, then we can pick the 21 's in 3 ways. Finally, if there is one 1, then we pick this 1 in 3 ways. There are $1+3+3=7$ ways. - The lowest 1 is in $L_{3}$. There is 1 way. - There are no 1's. Then $f$ sends everything to 0. There is 1 way. In total, there are $1+10+7+1+1=20$ total $f^{\prime}$ 's.

<definition>The ability to translate a mathematical problem into a different form or structure that facilitates understanding and solution. This includes creating visual or conceptual models, introducing notation, and organizing information in a way that highlights important relationships.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>207</end>
<text>Consider the unit cube with vertices $\{0,1\}^{3}$. Let $O=(0,0,0), A=(1,0,0), B=(0,1,0), C=(0,0,1)$, $D=(0,1,1), E=(1,0,1), F=(1,1,0)$, and $P=(1,1,1)$.</text>
<explanation>The solver represents the abstract domain $\{0,1\}^3$ as vertices of a unit cube in 3D space and assigns letter labels to each vertex. This geometric representation transforms the abstract function domain into a concrete visual model that's easier to work with and reason about.</explanation>

<start>485</start>
<end>600</end>
<text>We group the vertices into four levels: $L_{0}=\{O\}, L_{1}=\{A, B, C\}, L_{2}=\{D, E, F\}$, and $L_{3}=\{P\}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver further organizes the vertices into "levels" based on the number of 1's in their coordinates. This hierarchical representation captures the partial ordering relationship implied by the problem constraint ($a_i \geq b_i$) and creates a structure that will facilitate the subsequent analysis.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Planning</skill>
<definition>The ability to devise an overall approach to solving a problem, including breaking it down into manageable parts and determining the sequence of steps needed to reach a solution.</definition>

<start>600</start>
<end>651</end>
<text>We do casework on the lowest level of a 1 in a function.</text>
<explanation>The solver develops a strategic approach to count the valid functions by categorizing them according to the lowest level where the function outputs a value of 1. This demonstrates planning ahead and creating a systematic framework for solving the entire problem.</explanation>

<start>207</start>
<end>484</end>
<text>We want to find a function $f$ on these vertices such that $f(1, y, z) \geq f(0, y, z)$ (and symmetric representations). For instance, if $f(A)=1$, then $f(E)=f(F)=f(P)=1$ as well, and if $f(D)=1$, then $f(P)=1$ as well.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies the key constraint of the problem and explores its implications through examples, setting up the logical foundation for the solution approach. This shows planning by establishing the rules that will guide the subsequent analysis.</explanation>

<skill>Systematic Case Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and methodically explore all relevant cases or possibilities in a problem, ensuring completeness of the solution while avoiding redundancy.</definition>

<start>651</start>
<end>745</end>
<text>- If the 1 is in $L_{0}$, then $f$ maps everything to 1, for a total of 1 way.</text>
<explanation>The solver begins a systematic analysis by examining the first case where the lowest level containing a 1 is L₀. This demonstrates the start of a comprehensive case-by-case analysis.</explanation>

<start>745</start>
<end>1164</end>
<text>- If the 1 is in $L_{1}$, then $f(O)=0$. If there are 31 's in $L_{1}$, then everything but $O$ must be mapped to 1, for 1 way. If there are 21 's in $L_{1}$, then $f\left(L_{2}\right)=f\left(L_{3}\right)=1$, and there are 3 ways to choose the 21 's in $L_{1}$, for a total of 3 ways. If there is one 1, then WLOG $f(A)=1$. Then $f(E)=f(F)=f(P)=1$, and $f(D)$ equals either 0 or 1. There are $3 \cdot 2=6$ ways to do this. In total, there are $1+3+6=10$ ways for the lowest 1 to be in $L_{1}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver continues the case analysis by examining the second main case (lowest 1 in L₁) and further breaks it down into subcases based on how many vertices in L₁ map to 1. This demonstrates thorough and systematic exploration of possibilities.</explanation>

<start>1164</start>
<end>1438</end>
<text>- If the lowest 1 is in $L_{2}$, then $f(O)=f\left(L_{1}\right)=0$. If there are 31 's in $L_{2}$, there is one way to make $f$. If there are 21 's, then we can pick the 21 's in 3 ways. Finally, if there is one 1, then we pick this 1 in 3 ways. There are $1+3+3=7$ ways.</text>
<explanation>The solver methodically proceeds to the third case (lowest 1 in L₂) and again breaks it down into subcases, maintaining the systematic approach established earlier. This demonstrates consistency in the case analysis method.</explanation>

<start>1438</start>
<end>1481</end>
<text>- The lowest 1 is in $L_{3}$. There is 1 way.</text>
<explanation>The solver examines the fourth case where the lowest 1 is in L₃, maintaining the systematic approach to ensure all possibilities are covered.</explanation>

<start>1481</start>
<end>1536</end>
<text>- There are no 1's. Then $f$ sends everything to 0. There is 1 way.</text>
<explanation>The solver completes the case analysis by considering the final possibility where the function maps everything to 0. This demonstrates thoroughness in covering all possible cases.</explanation>

<skill>Combinatorial Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to count, enumerate, or determine the number of ways to arrange or select objects according to specified criteria, often involving principles like the multiplication principle, permutations, and combinations.</definition>

<start>851</start>
<end>978</end>
<text>If there are 21 's in $L_{1}$, then $f\left(L_{2}\right)=f\left(L_{3}\right)=1$, and there are 3 ways to choose the 21 's in $L_{1}$, for a total of 3 ways.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies combinatorial reasoning to determine that there are 3 ways to choose 2 elements from the 3 vertices in L₁. This demonstrates the ability to count arrangements according to specific criteria.</explanation>

<start>1078</start>
<end>1136</end>
<text>There are $3 \cdot 2=6$ ways to do this. In total, there are $1+3+6=10$ ways</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the multiplication principle (3 choices for which vertex in L₁ is 1, times 2 possibilities for f(D)) to calculate the number of valid functions in this subcase, then adds up all subcases. This shows combinatorial reasoning to enumerate possibilities.</explanation>

<start>1309</start>
<end>1388</end>
<text>If there are 21 's, then we can pick the 21 's in 3 ways. Finally, if there is one 1, then we pick this 1 in 3 ways.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies combinatorial reasoning to count the number of ways to select vertices in L₂ that map to 1, recognizing there are 3 ways to choose 2 elements from 3, and 3 ways to choose 1 element from 3.</explanation>

<start>1536</start>
<end>1604</end>
<text>In total, there are $1+10+7+1+1=20$ total $f^{\prime}$ 's.</text>
<explanation>The solver combines all the counts from the different cases to determine the total number of valid functions, demonstrating the ability to aggregate combinatorial results.</explanation>

<skill>Logical Inference</skill>
<definition>The ability to derive new information or conclusions from given premises or constraints through deductive reasoning, following logical rules and implications.</definition>

<start>207</start>
<end>484</end>
<text>We want to find a function $f$ on these vertices such that $f(1, y, z) \geq f(0, y, z)$ (and symmetric representations). For instance, if $f(A)=1$, then $f(E)=f(F)=f(P)=1$ as well, and if $f(D)=1$, then $f(P)=1$ as well.</text>
<explanation>The solver infers the implications of the constraint that f(a₁,a₂,a₃) ≥ f(b₁,b₂,b₃) when a_i ≥ b_i. They deduce that if a vertex has value 1, then all "higher" vertices (in terms of the partial ordering) must also have value 1. This demonstrates deductive reasoning from the given constraints.</explanation>

<start>745</start>
<end>784</end>
<text>- If the 1 is in $L_{1}$, then $f(O)=0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver infers that if the lowest level containing a 1 is L₁, then L₀ (which contains only O) must map to 0. This is a logical deduction based on the definition of "lowest level containing a 1."</explanation>

<start>1164</start>
<end>1219</end>
<text>- If the lowest 1 is in $L_{2}$, then $f(O)=f\left(L_{1}\right)=0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver deduces that if the lowest level containing a 1 is L₂, then all vertices in lower levels (L₀ and L₁) must map to 0. This demonstrates consistent application of logical inference throughout the solution.</explanation>

<skill>Abstraction</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and focus on the essential aspects of a problem while ignoring irrelevant details, often by recognizing patterns, generalizing concepts, or creating simplified models.</definition>

<start>978</start>
<end>1078</end>
<text>If there is one 1, then WLOG $f(A)=1$. Then $f(E)=f(F)=f(P)=1$, and $f(D)$ equals either 0 or 1.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses the phrase "WLOG" (without loss of generality) to indicate that due to symmetry, they can assume the single 1 in L₁ is at vertex A. This demonstrates abstraction by recognizing that the specific choice doesn't matter due to the symmetrical nature of the problem, simplifying the analysis.</explanation>

<start>485</start>
<end>600</end>
<text>We group the vertices into four levels: $L_{0}=\{O\}, L_{1}=\{A, B, C\}, L_{2}=\{D, E, F\}$, and $L_{3}=\{P\}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver abstracts the vertices into levels based on the number of 1's in their coordinates. This abstraction captures the essential partial ordering structure of the problem while simplifying the representation to make the analysis more tractable.</explanation>
