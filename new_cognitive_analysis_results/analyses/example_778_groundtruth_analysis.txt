Problem:
Find $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{\frac{2000000}{4^{k}}}}{2}\right\rfloor$ where $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to $x$.

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
The $k$ th floor (for $k \geq 0$) counts the number of positive integer solutions to $4^{k}(2 x-1)^{2} \leq 2 \cdot 10^{6}$. So summing over all $k$, we want the number of integer solutions to $4^{k}(2 x-1)^{2} \leq 2 \cdot 10^{6}$ with $k \geq 0$ and $x \geq 1$. But each positive integer can be uniquely represented as a power of 2 times an odd (positive) integer, so there are simply $\left\lfloor 10^{3} \sqrt{2}\right\rfloor=1414$ solutions.

# Analysis of Cognitive Skills in the Mathematical Problem-Solving Trajectory

<skill>Reformulation and Reframing</skill>
<definition>The ability to transform a mathematical problem into an equivalent form that is more tractable or reveals new insights. This involves recasting the original problem in terms of a different mathematical structure or concept.</definition>

<text>The $k$ th floor (for $k \geq 0$) counts the number of positive integer solutions to $4^{k}(2 x-1)^{2} \leq 2 \cdot 10^{6}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver reformulates the floor function expression as a counting problem involving integer solutions to an inequality. This transformation changes the perspective from evaluating a sum of floor functions to counting solutions of an inequality, which is a significant conceptual shift that makes the problem more approachable.</explanation>

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify regularities, structures, or meaningful relationships in mathematical expressions or problems that can lead to insights or solution strategies.</definition>

<text>But each positive integer can be uniquely represented as a power of 2 times an odd (positive) integer</text>
<explanation>This is a crucial insight that connects the problem to a fundamental number theory property. The solver recognizes that the structure of the inequality relates to the unique factorization of integers as powers of 2 multiplied by odd numbers, which dramatically simplifies the counting problem.</explanation>

<skill>Algorithmic Thinking</skill>

<explanation>The solver develops a systematic approach by first reframing the problem as counting solutions to an inequality, then using the unique factorization property to simplify the counting process.

So summing over all $k$, we want the number of integer solutions to $4^{k}(2 x-1)^{2} \leq 2 \cdot 10^{6}$ with $k \geq 0$ and $x \geq 1$. But each positive integer can be uniquely represented as a power of 2 times an odd (positive) integer, so there are simply $\left\lfloor 10^{3} \sqrt{2}\right\rfloor=1414$ solutions.</text>
<explanation>Throughout the solution, the solver abstracts the problem to its essential mathematical structure - recognizing that it's fundamentally about counting integers with certain properties. This abstraction allows them to connect the problem to the unique factorization of integers and arrive at an elegant solution.</explanation>
