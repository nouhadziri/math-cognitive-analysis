\[ 1 \plus{} \frac {z}{2!} \plus{} \frac {z(z \plus{} 1)}{3!} \plus{} \frac {z(z \plus{} 1)(z \plus{} 2)}{4!} \plus{} \cdots \plus{} \frac {z(z \plus{} 1)\cdots(z \plus{} n)}{(n \plus{} 2)!} \plus{} \cdots\]
converges and find its sum.

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Series Representation and Convergence**:
   We start with the series:
   \[
   S(z) = 1 + \frac{z}{2!} + \frac{z(z+1)}{3!} + \frac{z(z+1)(z+2)}{4!} + \cdots
   \]
   To determine the convergence of this series, we can use the ratio test. Consider the general term:
   \[
   a_n = \frac{z(z+1)\cdots(z+n-1)}{(n+1)!}
   \]
   The ratio of consecutive terms is:
   \[
   \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right| = \left| \frac{z(z+1)\cdots(z+n)}{(n+2)!} \cdot \frac{(n+1)!}{z(z+1)\cdots(z+n-1)} \right| = \left| \frac{z+n}{n+2} \right|
   \]
   As \( n \to \infty \), this ratio approaches \( |z| \). Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges if \( |z| < 1 \).

2. **Sum of the Series**:
   Let \( S(z) \) denote the sum of the series. We can write:
   \[
   S(z) - 1 = \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{\prod_{i=0}^{n}(z+i)}{(n+2)!}
   \]
   Using the Gamma function property \( \Gamma(z+1) = z\Gamma(z) \), we have:
   \[
   \Gamma(z) \prod_{i=0}^{n}(z+i) = \Gamma(z+n+1)
   \]
   Thus, we can rewrite the series as:
   \[
   S(z) - 1 = \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{\Gamma(z+n+1)}{\Gamma(n+3)}
   \]
   Using the Beta function \( \beta(x,y) = \frac{\Gamma(x)\Gamma(y)}{\Gamma(x+y)} \), we get:
   \[
   \sum_{n \geq 0} \beta(z+n+1, 2-z) = \sum_{n \geq 0} \int_0^{\pi/2} \sin^{2z+2n+1}(\alpha) \cos^{3-2z}(\alpha) \, d\alpha
   \]
   This can be simplified to:
   \[
   2 \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos^{3-2z}(\alpha) \sin^{2z+1}(\alpha) \sum_{n \geq 0} \sin^{2n}(\alpha) \, d\alpha
   \]
   The sum \( \sum_{n \geq 0} \sin^{2n}(\alpha) \) converges to \( \frac{1}{1-\sin^2(\alpha)} = \frac{1}{\cos^2(\alpha)} \). Therefore:
   \[
   2 \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos^{1-2z}(\alpha) \sin^{2z+1}(\alpha) \, d\alpha = \Gamma(1+z)\Gamma(1-z)
   \]
   Hence:
   \[
   S(z) = \frac{\Gamma(1+z)\Gamma(1-z)}{\Gamma(z)\Gamma(2-z)} + 1
   \]
   Using the reflection formula for the Gamma function \( \Gamma(1-z)\Gamma(z) = \frac{\pi}{\sin(\pi z)} \), we get:
   \[
   S(z) = (1-z)^{-1}
   \]

The final answer is \( \boxed{ S(z) = \frac{1}{1-z} } \).
