Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Determine the roots of \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \):**
   - \( p(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 - 15x + 9 \)
   - \( q(x) = 12x^3 + 6x^2 - 7x + 1 \)

   To show that each polynomial has exactly three distinct real roots, we need to analyze their derivatives and use the Intermediate Value Theorem and Rolle's Theorem.

2. **Find the derivative of \( p(x) \):**
   \[
   p'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(4x^3 - 2x^2 - 15x + 9) = 12x^2 - 4x - 15
   \]
   - Solve \( p'(x) = 0 \):
     \[
     12x^2 - 4x - 15 = 0
     \]
     Using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
     \[
     x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 720}}{24} = \frac{4 \pm 28}{24}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{32}{24} = \frac{4}{3}, \quad x = \frac{-24}{24} = -1
     \]
   - These critical points divide the real line into intervals. Evaluate \( p(x) \) at these points and at the boundaries to determine the sign changes.

3. **Find the derivative of \( q(x) \):**
   \[
   q'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(12x^3 + 6x^2 - 7x + 1) = 36x^2 + 12x - 7
   \]
   - Solve \( q'(x) = 0 \):
     \[
     36x^2 + 12x - 7 = 0
     \]
     Using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     x = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{144 + 1008}}{72} = \frac{-12 \pm 36}{72}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{24}{72} = \frac{1}{3}, \quad x = \frac{-48}{72} = -\frac{2}{3}
     \]
   - These critical points divide the real line into intervals. Evaluate \( q(x) \) at these points and at the boundaries to determine the sign changes.

4. **Verify the largest roots \( A \) and \( B \):**
   - Let \( A \) be the largest root of \( p(x) \).
   - Let \( B \) be the largest root of \( q(x) \).

5. **Show that \( A^2 + 3B^2 = 4 \):**
   - Assume \( B = \frac{\sqrt{3(4 - A^2)}}{3} \).
   - Substitute \( B \) into \( q(x) \) and verify it is a root:
     \[
     q\left(\frac{\sqrt{3(4 - A^2)}}{3}\right) = 12\left(\frac{\sqrt{3(4 - A^2)}}{3}\right)^3 + 6\left(\frac{\sqrt{3(4 - A^2)}}{3}\right)^2 - 7\left(\frac{\sqrt{3(4 - A^2)}}{3}\right) + 1
     \]
     Simplify and verify that it equals zero.

6. **Verify the equation \( (3 - \frac{4A^2}{3})^2 3(4 - A^2) = (9 - 2A^2)^2 \):**
   - Expand and simplify both sides to show they are equal:
     \[
     (3 - \frac{4A^2}{3})^2 3(4 - A^2) = (9 - 2A^2)^2
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     16A^4 - 124A^3 + 261A^2 - 81 = 0
     \]
     This follows from \( (4A^3 - 25A)^2 = (2A^2 - 9)^2 \).

7. **Verify \( \frac{\sqrt{3(4 - A^2)}}{3} \) is in the interval \( (\frac{1}{3}, 1) \):**
   - Check the interval for \( A \) and ensure \( B \) lies within \( (\frac{1}{3}, 1) \).

The final answer is \( \boxed{ A^2 + 3B^2 = 4 } \).
