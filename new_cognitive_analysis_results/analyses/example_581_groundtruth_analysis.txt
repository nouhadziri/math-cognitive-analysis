Problem:
A coaxial cable is cylindrically symmetric and consists of a solid inner cylinder of radius $a=2 \mathrm{~cm}$ and an outer cylindrical shell of inner radius $b=5 \mathrm{~cm}$ and outer radius $c=7 \mathrm{~cm}$. A uniformly distributed current of total magnitude $I=5 \mathrm{~A}$ is flowing in the inner cylinder and a uniformly distributed current of the same magnitude but opposite direction flows in the outer shell. Find the magnitude $B(r)$ of the magnetic field $B$ as a function of distance $r$ from the axis of the cable. As the final result, submit $\int_{0}^{\infty} B(r) \mathrm{d} r$. In case this is infinite, submit 42 .

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Ampere's law $\int B \cdot \mathrm{d} l=\mu_{0} I$ is all we need. For every point on the wire, we can write the magnetic field as a function of the distance from its center $r$. Thus,
$$
B(r)= \begin{cases}\frac{5 \mu_{0} r}{8 \pi} & r \leq 2 \\ \frac{5 \mu_{0}}{2 \pi r} & 2<r<5 \\ \frac{5 \mu_{0}\left(-r^{2}+49\right)}{48 \pi r} & 5 \leq r \leq 7 \\ 0 & r>7\end{cases}
$$

Now we just sum each integral from each interval, or in othe words

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} B(r) \mathrm{d} r=\int_{0}^{2} B(r) \mathrm{d} r+\int_{2}^{5} B(r) \mathrm{d} r+\int_{5}^{7} B(r) \mathrm{d} r
$$

This is now straightforward integration.
