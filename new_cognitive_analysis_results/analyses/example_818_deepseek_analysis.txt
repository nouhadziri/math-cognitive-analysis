Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Alright, so I've got this problem here: we've got two integers, x and y, each between 100 and 999 inclusive. y is the number you get when you reverse the digits of x. Then z is the absolute difference between x and y. The question is asking how many distinct values of z are possible. Hmm, okay. Let me think.

First off, since x and y are both three-digit numbers, let's represent them in terms of their digits. Let me denote x as a three-digit number where the hundreds digit is a, the tens digit is b, and the units digit is c. So, x = 100a + 10b + c. Then, reversing the digits of x, y would be 100c + 10b + a. Got that part.

Then z = |x - y|. Let's substitute in the expressions for x and y. So, z = |(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a)|. Let me compute the difference first. Expanding that out:

100a + 10b + c - 100c - 10b - a

Simplify like terms. The 10b and -10b cancel out. Then 100a - a is 99a, and c - 100c is -99c. So overall, we have 99a - 99c = 99(a - c). So, z = |99(a - c)|. Since we have the absolute value, that would be 99|a - c|. Therefore, z is a multiple of 99, specifically 99 times the absolute difference between the first and last digits of x. So, z must be 99 times some integer between 0 and 9, because a and c are digits from 1 to 9 (since x is a three-digit number, a and c can't be 0). Wait, hang on. Let me confirm that. a and c digits: a is from 1 to 9, because x is a three-digit number. Similarly, y is a three-digit number, which means c must also be from 1 to 9 because when you reverse x, the first digit of y is c, and since y is three digits, c can't be 0. Right. Therefore, both a and c are in 1-9. Therefore, |a - c| can be from 0 to 8. Wait, because if a is 9 and c is 1, that's a difference of 8. Wait, hold on. What is the maximum possible difference between a and c?

Since a and c are both from 1 to 9, the maximum |a - c| would be when one is 9 and the other is 1, giving 8? Wait, no. Wait: if a is 9 and c is 1, |9 - 1| = 8, or if a is 1 and c is 9, |1 - 9| = 8. So the maximum difference is 8? Wait, that can't be. Wait, if a is 9 and c is 0, but c can't be 0. Wait, the difference can actually only go up to 8? Wait, but suppose a is 9 and c is 1, difference is 8; a is 9 and c is 9, difference is 0. Hmm. Wait, so |a - c| can be from 0 to 8? Wait, but 9 - 1 is 8, 9 - 2 is 7, etc. Wait, is that correct? If a and c can be from 1-9, then the largest possible difference is 9 - 1 = 8. Yeah, so |a - c| can be 0,1,2,...,8. Therefore, multiplying by 99, z can be 0,99,198,..., up to 792. Therefore, that would suggest 9 distinct values. But wait, that doesn't sound right. Because the original problem is giving z as |x - y|. But when z is 0, that implies x = y. So how does z look?

But wait, first, in the problem, x and y are both between 100 and 999 inclusive, and y is the reversal of x. So, if x is a palindrome number (reads the same forwards and backwards), then y = x, so z = 0. But the problem states that x and y are distinct? No, wait, the problem just says y is the number formed by reversing the digits of x. So if x is a palindrome, then y = x. But are palindromic numbers allowed?

Yes, in that case z = 0. So z can be zero. But then the answer would have z values from 0 up to 792 in steps of 99. Thus, 0, 99, 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792. That's 9 distinct values.

But wait, 9 values? Let me double-check because I might be oversimplifying. Wait, maybe not. Because in reality, even though z equals 99|a - c|, perhaps some differences |a - c| might not be achievable? For example, maybe when the middle digit b affects the difference? Wait, but wait, no. In the initial computation, the difference came out as 99(a - c), so b cancels out. That is, the middle digit doesn't affect the difference at all. So z only depends on the first and last digits. Therefore, in that case, all possible values of |a - c| from 0 to 8 would result in a distinct multiple of 99, from 0 to 792. Therefore, 9 distinct values.

But in that case, the answer should be 9. But I suspect the problem is a bit trickier. Maybe when considering leading zeros? But wait, x and y are between 100 and 999, inclusive. So when you reverse x, to get y, y can't have a leading zero. So since x is a three-digit number, its last digit can't be zero. Therefore, in x = 100a + 10b + c, c is from 1 to 9, so when reversed, y = 100c + 10b + a, so y has c as the first digit, which is non-zero. So, no problem.

So, since a and c are both 1-9 digits, their difference can be from 0 to 8? Wait, hang on. If a and c are both from 1-9, then the maximum difference would be if a=9 and c=1, or a=1 and c=9. That difference is 8. Wait, wait, 9-1=8, yes. So |a - c| is 0 to 8, inclusive. Therefore, |a - c| can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So nine possibilities. Then multiplied by 99, gives nine distinct z values: 0,99,198,297,396,495,594,693,792.

Therefore, the answer would be 9. But maybe that's wrong because for some |a - c|, there are multiple x and y leading to the same z? Wait, but z is directly determined by |a - c|, and every possible |a - c| is present. For example, if |a - c|=1, then 99 is a possible z. Similarly for other values.

Wait, but let's check whether each possible difference |a - c| can occur. So, when |a - c|=0, that is, when a = c, so x is a palindrome, so y = x, and z=0.

For |a - c|=1, say a=2, c=1; then z=99(1)=99. Similarly, a=1,c=2 gives the same.

But is there always at least one three-digit number with a given |a - c|? Like, if you need |a - c|=5, can you always find an a and c such that |a - c|=5? Yes, for example, a=6 and c=1, or a=1 and c=6.

Similarly for each difference from 0-8, you can choose a and c appropriately.

Therefore, each difference |a - c| from 0 to 8 is achievable. Therefore, each multiple of 99 from 0 to 792 is possible for z, leading to 9 distinct values.

Therefore, the answer is 9.

But now, I'm getting confused because, in some math competition problems, sometimes there's a case where certain differences might not be possible because of the reversal. Wait, but in our calculation above, z only depends on the first and last digits. So as long as a and c can be arranged to have any difference from 0-8, then z can be all those multiples of 99. Since a and c are digits from 1-9, the absolute differences from 0 to 8 are all possible.

Wait, maybe the problem is that z is allowed to be 0? The problem says "distinct values of z", and asks how many distinct values. So even though z=0 is possible (when x is a palindrome), but is that considered a distinct value? The problem doesn't specify to exclude it, so z=0 is allowed.

Hence, from 0 up to 792 in increments of 99: 0,99,198,297,396,495,594,693,792. Total of 9 values.

But hold on. Am I missing something here? Let me consider that.

Suppose we have different middle digits, that is, different values of b. Does that affect z? Because if x and y have different middle digits, but since when we subtract x - y, the middle digits cancel out (as we saw in the calculation earlier). Thus, z does not depend on the middle digit. Therefore, the value of z is purely dictated by a and c, regardless of the middle digit. Therefore, even if a and c are fixed, changing the middle digit will not affect z. So for any given pair (a,c), the same z will result no matter what b is. Therefore, even though there are multiple x's leading to the same z, they all result in the same z. So z is purely a function of |a - c|. Therefore, the number of distinct z's is the number of distinct |a - c|.

Which is from 0 to 8 inclusive, so 9.

Therefore, the answer is 9. However, wait a moment. Wait, let's verify with concrete examples.

Take x=121, which is a palindrome. Then y=121, z=0.

Take x=123, y=321. Then z=|123 - 321| = | -198 | = 198. Which is 2*99=198, where a=1, c=3, |1 -3|=2.

Another example: x=152, y=251. Then |152 -251| = 99, which is 99*1, since |1 -2|=1. Wait, x=152: a=1, c=2. y=251: a=2, c=1. |1 -2|=1, 99*1=99.

Another example: x=918, y=819. |918 -819| = 99. Here |9 -8|=1. Wait, that's also 99*1. So if |a -c|=1, then z=99.

But then a=9, c=8 gives the same as a=1, c=2. So, z depends only on the difference between a and c.

So all differences in |a - c| from 0 to 8 lead to distinct z's. Since 0 = 0*99, 1=1*99,..., 8 =8*99. Hence, 9 different z's.

Therefore, the answer is 9 distinct values.

But hold on, wait another moment. Let's check some difference more carefully.

Take x=212, y=212, z=0.

Take x=211, y=112, z=|211-112|=99.

x=311, y=113, |311 -113|=198.

Wait, |3 -1|=2, so 2*99=198. Correct.

x=411, y=114, z=411-114=297. That's 3*99=297. Correct.

x=511, y=115, z=511-115=396. 4*99=396.

x=611, y=116, z=611-116=495. 5*99=495.

x=711, y=117, z=711-117=594. 6*99=594.

x=811, y=118, z=811-118=693. 7*99=693.

x=911, y=119, z=911-119=792. 8*99=792.

Therefore, by taking x as 100a +10b +c where b is 1 and c is the next digit after a, but |a -c|=1,2,...8. This spans all the differences. Therefore, covering all the possible z values. So as such, the z can take 9 different values.

But let me check maybe if some numbers might result in a different z?

Wait, take x=202, y=202, z=0.

x=302, y=203, z=|302 -203|=99.

But |3 -2|=1, so z=99*1.

x=403, y=304, |403 -304|=99. Wait, z=99. But here, |4 -3|=1. However, a=4, c=3. But maybe through other numbers, maybe get more?

Wait, if |a -c|=3, the difference is 3*99=297.

x=503, y=305, |503-305|=198. That's 2*99=198. Wait, this contradicts?

Wait, hold on, x=503: a=5, c=3. |a -c|=2. So z=2*99=198. Wait, but 503 - 305 is 198, that's correct. So that's not 3*99, which would be 297. So to get 297, for example, x=703, y=307: |703 - 307|=396, which is 4*99=396.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe an example to get 297. Take |a - c|=3.

Like x=401, y=104: |401 -104|=297. Here a=4, c=1, |4-1|=3. Therefore, yes, 3*99=297. So 401 -104=297. Therefore, that works.

Hmmm. So |a - c| gives exactly the multiple of 99 for z. Hence, the possible z values are indeed multiples of 99 from 0 to 792.

Therefore, there are 9 distinct z values. So answer is 9.

But I want to check somewhere in the problem statement again: "How many distinct values of z are possible?" So, since x and y are both integers between 100 and 999 inclusive, y is formed by reversing digits of x. So, since in our previous analysis, z depends on the first and last digits of x, with the middle digit canceling out. Hence, the z is 99 multiplied by the absolute difference of first and last digits. Since the possible differences are 0 through 8, inclusive, so 9 possibilities, the number of distinct z is 9.

Therefore, the answer is 9.

But wait, is that really the case? Let me think again. Because often in problems like this, the answer is different and you can have more values. Hmm. Maybe my line of reasoning is incorrect.

Wait a second: Maybe not all differences from 0 to 8 are achievable for |a - c|? Maybe some of them aren't. For example, is |a -c|=8 possible? Let's think. If a=9 and c=1, then |9-1|=8. So x=9b1. Reversed is y=1b9. Then z= |900 + 10b +1 - (100 + 10b +9)|=|900 +10b +1 -100 -10b -9|=|792|=792. Which is 8*99=792. So yes, achievable. Therefore, |a -c|=8 is possible. Therefore, all differences from 0 to 8 are possible.

Therefore, 9.

So, to confirm:

|a -c|: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each gives a distinct z: 0, 99, 198, 297, 396,495,594,693,792. Each of these are possible. So, if that's the case, then 9 distinct z values.

Alternatively, I feel like perhaps certain z values might not be attainable, but in reality, the previous example shows all differences are possible.

Wait, given that when forming y, the reversed number, since x must be a three-digit number, leading digits can't be zero. So when you reverse x, the first digit of y is c, which has to be non-zero, so c is from 1-9. Similarly, the last digit of x is c, which is from 1-9, as y needs to be a three-digit number. Therefore, yes, both a and c are from 1-9. Therefore, |a - c| can be from 0-8, so 9 possibilities.

Thus, 9 distinct z values. Therefore, the answer is 9.

But before finalizing, let's check another source. Maybe check the number of possible differences:

The first and last digits can be 1-9. The possible absolute differences between two numbers from 1-9 would be 0-8, inclusive, as (9-1)=8. For example:

If the digits are 1 and 9: |1 - 9| =8.

Digits 2 and 9: |2 - 9|=7.

...

Digits 9 and9: |9-9|=0.

So between every possible pair, difference from0-8. So total 9 distinct differences, therefore z=99*d gives 9 distinct z.

Therefore, answer is 9.

But wait, the problem says the number of distinct values of z, but this seems too straightforward. Maybe there's a trick? Let me check with an example where different a and c pairs result in same |a -c|. For example, a=5 and c=3, |5-3|=2, while a=6 and c=4,|6-4|=2. Both give z=198. But since 198 is already covered, this is same z. Therefore, even different pairs (5,3) and (6,4) produce same z. Therefore, the z isn't affected by different pairs with same difference. So regardless, the key is |a - c|, and this can have 9 different values, 0-8.

Therefore, the answer is 9. So I think that is correct.

Alternatively, maybe when subtracting, even though middle digit cancels, z might sometimes collapse? For example, like different differences produce same result. But in the expression, if z=99*|a - c|, then unless |a -c| is same, z would be different. So if the factors |a -c| are different, then z would differ by multiples of 99. Since 99 is a fixed multiplier, any difference in |a -c| would lead to distinct z's. Therefore, yes, 9 distinct.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{9}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{9}

But |3 -2|=1, so z=99*1.

x=403, y=304, |403 -304|=99. Wait, z=99. But here, |4 -3|=1. However, a=4, c=3. But maybe through other numbers, maybe get more?

Wait, if |a -c|=3, the difference is 3*99=297.

x=503, y=305, |503-305|=198. That's 2*99=198. Wait, this contradicts?</text>
<explanation>The solver tests the hypothesis that the formula z = 99|a-c| holds for all cases by examining specific examples. When they encounter a potential contradiction, they investigate further to determine whether their understanding is correct.</explanation>

<start>7189</start>
<end>7528</end>
<text>Wait, hold on, x=503: a=5, c=3. |a -c|=2. So z=2*99=198. Wait, but 503 - 305 is 198, that's correct. So that's not 3*99, which would be 297. So to get 297, for example, x=703, y=307: |703 - 307|=396, which is 4*99=396.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe an example to get 297. Take |a - c|=3.

Like x=401, y=104: |401 -104|=297. Here a=4, c=1, |4-1|=3. Therefore, yes, 3*99=297. So 401 -104=297. Therefore, that works.</text>
<explanation>The solver continues testing their hypothesis, working through examples to verify that the formula z = 99|a-c| consistently predicts the correct value of z. When they encounter confusion, they work through additional examples to clarify their understanding.</explanation>

<end>3244</end>
<text>Wait, hang on. If a and c are both from 1-9, then the maximum difference would be if a=9 and c=1, or a=1 and c=9. That difference is 8. Wait, wait, 9-1=8, yes. So |a - c| is 0 to 8, inclusive. Therefore, |a - c| can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So nine possibilities. Then multiplied by 99, gives nine distinct z values: 0,99,198,297,396,495,594,693,792.

Therefore, the answer would be 9. But maybe that's wrong because for some |a - c|, there are multiple x and y leading to the same z? Wait, but z is directly determined by |a - c|, and every possible |a - c| is present. For example, if |a - c|=1, then 99 is a possible z. Similarly for other values.</text>
<explanation>The solver carefully analyzes all possible values of |a-c| and calculates the corresponding values of z, ensuring that they have considered all possibilities. They also consider whether multiple pairs of x and y might lead to the same z value, demonstrating a commitment to exhaustive analysis.</explanation>

<start>8178</start>
<end>8580</end>
<text>Wait, given that when forming y, the reversed number, since x must be a three-digit number, leading digits can't be zero. So when you reverse x, the first digit of y is c, which has to be non-zero, so c is from 1-9. Similarly, the last digit of x is c, which is from 1-9, as y needs to be a three-digit number. Therefore, yes, both a and c are from 1-9. Therefore, |a - c| can be from 0-8, so 9 possibilities.

Thus, 9 distinct z values. Therefore, the answer is 9.</text>
<explanation>The solver conducts a final check of all constraints and possible cases, confirming that the range of |a-c| is indeed 0 to 8, yielding 9 distinct values of z.</explanation>

SUMMARY_START
The most important cognitive skills demonstrated in this mathematical problem-solving trajectory are:

1. Algebraic representation - The solver effectively translates the problem into algebraic notation, representing three-digit numbers in terms of their digits and establishing the key relationship between x and y.

2. Algebraic manipulation - The solver simplifies expressions to derive the crucial insight that z = 99|a-c|, which becomes the foundation for the entire solution.

3. Verification through examples - The solver consistently tests their understanding with concrete examples, ensuring the validity of their approach and conclusions.

4. Constraint analysis - The solver carefully analyzes the constraints on the digits a and c, recognizing that they must both be between 1 and 9, which limits the possible values of |a-c|.

5. Metacognitive monitoring - Throughout the solution process, the solver questions their own reasoning, identifies potential errors, and adjusts their approach accordingly, demonstrating strong self-regulation of their thinking.
