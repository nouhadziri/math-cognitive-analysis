Problem:
Two electromagnetic (em) fields are applied on the 1s->2p transition of a Hydrogen atomic vapor sample. The field#1 is polarized in z-direction, propagating in x-direction, with an amplitude E1, wave vector amplitude k, and frequency w1. The field#2 is circularly polarized, propagating in z-direction, with an amplitude E2, wave vector amplitude k, and frequency w2. Let us now apply a dc electric field with an amplitude E0 along z-direction to this vapor sample. The absorption probability of both the em fields will be maximum and equal, if the frequency w2 is given by (where a0 is the Bohr radius and e is the electronic charge)
Answer Choices:
(A) 8.7 e a0 E0
(B) 3 e a0 E0
(C) 5.1 e a0 E0
(D) 11.54 e a0 E0

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
The dc electric field will dress the excited states |2,0,0> and |2,1,0>. The energy of these dressed states (equal superpositions of |2,0,0> and |2,1,0>) will be shifted by an amount of 3e a0 E0 (see https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/aqm/aqmeight.pdf).
The absorption probabilities are proportional to d^2 w^3, where d is the dipole matrix elements and w is the transition frequencies (see https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/qm/Quantum/node86.html).

In the present case, the field#1 will couple to the |1,0,0>->|2,1,0> transition and the field#2 will couple to the |1,0,0> -> |2,1,1> transition. The corresponding dipole matrix elements are in a ratio of 1:sqrt(2) (see https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/qmech/Quantum/node122.html).

Then, the transitions probabilities will be equal when the product d^2 w^3 becomes equal for both the transitions, on respective resonances. This means, w1^3 = 2 w2^3 and w1 - w2 = 3e a0 E0. Solving these two equations, we get w2 = 11.54 e a0 E0.

The other answers are obviously wrong.

<text>Then, the transitions probabilities will be equal when the product d^2 w^3 becomes equal for both the transitions, on respective resonances. This means, w1^3 = 2 w2^3 and w1 - w2 = 3e a0 E0.</text>
<explanation>The solver translates the physical requirement (equal absorption probabilities) into mathematical equations.

<explanation>The solver mentions solving the system of two equations (w1^3 = 2 w2^3 and w1 - w2 = 3e a0 E0) to find the value of w2. While the detailed steps aren't shown, this indicates the application of equation-solving skills to determine the final answer.</explanation>

Then, the transitions probabilities will be equal when the product d^2 w^3 becomes equal for both the transitions, on respective resonances. This means, w1^3 = 2 w2^3 and w1 - w2 = 3e a0 E0.</text>
<explanation>The solver integrates multiple concepts: the coupling of electromagnetic fields to specific transitions, the ratio of dipole matrix elements, the formula for absorption probabilities, and the energy shift due to the electric field. They combine these separate pieces of information to formulate the equations needed for the solution.</explanation>

<skill>Logical Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to make valid inferences and draw conclusions based on given information, following principles of logical thinking.</definition>

<start>519</start>

<text>Then, the transitions probabilities will be equal when the product d^2 w^3 becomes equal for both the transitions, on respective resonances. This means, w1^3 = 2 w2^3 and w1 - w2 = 3e a0 E0.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses logical reasoning to deduce that for equal absorption probabilities, the product d^2 w^3 must be equal for both transitions. They then logically infer that since the dipole matrix elements are in ratio 1:sqrt(2), their squares would be in ratio 1:2, leading to the equation w1^3 = 2 w2^3. This demonstrates clear logical thinking to connect the physical requirements to mathematical constraints.</explanation>
