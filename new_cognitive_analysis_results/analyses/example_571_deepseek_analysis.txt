Problem:
Suppose that  $X$  and  $Y$  are two metric spaces and  $f:X \longrightarrow Y$  is a continious function. Also for every compact set  $K \subseteq Y$ , it's pre-image  $f^{pre}(K)$  is a compact set in  $X$ . Prove that  $f$  is a closed function, i.e for every close set  $C\subseteq X$ , it's image  $f(C)$  is a closed subset of  $Y$ .

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, let's see. I need to prove that the function f is closed, meaning that for every closed set C in X, the image f(C) is closed in Y. The given conditions are that f is continuous and that the pre-image of every compact set in Y is compact in X. 

First, let me recall some definitions: A closed function maps closed sets to closed sets. A continuous function has pre-images of open sets being open, but that's not directly helpful here. The key property given here is about compact pre-images. Since f is continuous, the pre-image of a compact set is closed (since compact sets in metric spaces are closed, and pre-images of closed sets under continuous functions are closed). Wait, but actually, before that, in metric spaces compact sets are closed and bounded, right? So if K is compact in Y, then it's closed, and since f is continuous, f−1(K) is closed in X. But the problem states that f−1(K) is also compact. So, we already know that f−1(K) is compact, hence closed (since compact subsets of metric spaces are closed). So that gives us that the pre-image of any compact set is not just closed but compact.

But how does that help us show that images of closed sets are closed? Hmm. Let's think. 

Suppose C is closed in X. We need to show f(C) is closed in Y. To show a set is closed in a metric space, we can show that it contains all its limit points. Alternatively, show that the complement is open. But maybe sequential closure? In metric spaces, closed sets are sequentially closed, so maybe take a sequence in f(C) that converges to a point in Y and show that the limit is in f(C). 

So let's take a sequence {y_n} in f(C) that converges to some y in Y. Since Y is a metric space, it's Hausdorff, so compact sets are closed. Since {y_n} converges to y, the set K = {y_n | n ∈ N} ∪ {y} is compact in Y. Because in metric spaces, a set is compact if it's closed and totally bounded, but actually, more precisely, a set is compact if every sequence has a convergent subsequence with limit in the set. So for K, any sequence in K either has infinitely many terms equal to some y_n or approaches y. So K is compact. Then, the pre-image f−1(K) is compact in X. 

Now, since y_n is in f(C), each y_n has a pre-image x_n in C. So x_n ∈ f−1(K) ∩ C. But C is closed in X, and f−1(K) is compact, hence closed. So f−1(K) ∩ C is closed in X, and also, since f−1(K) is compact and C is closed, their intersection is a closed subset of a compact set, hence compact (in metric spaces, closed subsets of compact sets are compact). Therefore, the sequence {x_n} is in a compact set f−1(K) ∩ C, which is compact. Therefore, {x_n} has a convergent subsequence {x_{n_k}} that converges to some x ∈ f−1(K) ∩ C. Since C is closed, x is in C. 

Since f is continuous, f(x_{n_k}) → f(x). But f(x_{n_k}) = y_{n_k} and we already have y_{n_k} → y. Therefore, the limit y must be equal to f(x). But x is in C, so y = f(x) ∈ f(C). Therefore, y is in f(C). Thus, f(C) contains all its limit points, so it's closed. 

Wait, so did that work? Let me go through again. The key steps are:

1. Take a convergent sequence in f(C), which is {y_n} → y in Y.
2. The set K = {y_n} ∪ {y} is compact in Y.
3. By given condition, f−1(K) is compact in X.
4. Since C is closed, the pre-images x_n of y_n are in f−1(K) ∩ C, which is closed in the compact set f−1(K), hence compact.
5. Therefore, the sequence {x_n} has a convergent subsequence in f−1(K) ∩ C, whose limit x is in C.
6. By continuity, f(x) is the limit of the corresponding subsequence of {y_n}, hence y = f(x) ∈ f(C).

Therefore, f(C) is closed.

Another approach: maybe using the fact that in metric spaces, a set is compact if and only if it's sequentially compact. Therefore, pulling back the compactness gives us that the pre-images are sequentially compact. So, sequences in the pre-image have convergent subsequences. But not sure if necessitating another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using the characterization that in metric spaces, a set is closed if it's sequentially closed. Since we just did that with the sequence argument. 

Is there another way? Suppose C is closed in X. To show f(C) is closed, take a point y in the closure of f(C); we need to show y ∈ f(C). Since y is in the closure, there exists a sequence {y_n} in f(C) converging to y. Then, we proceed as above: {y_n} ∪ {y} is compact, so the pre-image is compact. The pre-images x_n of y_n are in C ∩ f−1(K), which is compact. Thus, the x_n have a convergent subsequence to x in C, which maps to y. Therefore, y ∈ f(C).

Yes, that works. So all steps are valid. Therefore, f is closed.

I think this is okay. The critical point is the compactness of the pre-image of K = {y_n} ∪ {y}, allowing us to get a convergent subsequence of pre-images in C. Since C is closed, the limit stays in C, and by continuity, maps to the limit y. Therefore, f(C) is closed.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{f \text{ is a closed function}}
