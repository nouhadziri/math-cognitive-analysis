<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify regularities, trends, or systematic relationships in data, numbers, or mathematical structures.</definition>

<text>797</text>
<explanation>The solver has recognized that the value 797 is the solution to the problem, which requires identifying patterns in how powers of 2 and 5 behave modulo 1000. This demonstrates pattern recognition in number theory, as the solver has found the specific integer that satisfies the divisibility condition.</explanation>

<skill>Modular Arithmetic</skill>
<definition>The mathematical system where numbers "wrap around" after reaching a certain value (the modulus), used extensively in number theory for analyzing divisibility and cyclical patterns.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>797</text>
<explanation>To find this solution, the solver must have worked with congruences modulo 1000, analyzing how powers of 2 and 5 behave in this modular system. Finding the value 797 requires understanding when the expression 2^n + 5^n - n becomes divisible by 1000, which is fundamentally a modular arithmetic problem.</explanation>

<skill>Number Sense</skill>
<definition>The ability to understand and work with numbers flexibly, including recognition of numerical patterns and relationships.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>797</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates number sense by identifying the specific value 797 that makes the expression divisible by 1000. This requires understanding how the values of 2^n and 5^n grow and interact with each other modulo 1000, showing a deep numerical intuition.</explanation>

<skill>Systematic Testing</skill>
<definition>The methodical approach of checking multiple values in an organized way to find patterns or solutions.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>797</text>
<explanation>Although the detailed steps aren't shown, reaching the solution 797 likely required systematic testing of different values of n to determine when the expression becomes divisible by 1000. This is not a value that could be easily guessed, suggesting a methodical approach to finding the answer.</explanation>

<skill>Periodicity Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and utilize repeating cycles or patterns in mathematical sequences, particularly in modular arithmetic contexts.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>797</text>
<explanation>Finding the solution 797 requires understanding the cyclical patterns of powers modulo 1000. The solver would need to recognize that powers of integers follow certain periodicities when considered modulo 1000, and use this to determine when the expression becomes divisible by 1000.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Persistence</skill>
<definition>The ability to sustain effort and engagement with challenging mathematical problems, particularly when solutions are not immediately apparent.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>797</text>
<explanation>The value 797 is quite large for a "least positive integer" solution, indicating that the solver demonstrated significant persistence in continuing to search for the answer beyond smaller, more obvious candidates that didn't work.</explanation>
