Domain: Combinatorics

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Here's a thinking process to determine the appropriate frequency coverage for a galaxy redshift survey targeting dark energy:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal is to study dark energy by mapping large-scale structures (like galaxy clusters) at various *redshifts*. Redshift is key because it directly relates to distance and the expansion of the universe over time.

2. **Connect Redshift to Observable Frequencies:**  Remember the relationship: emitted wavelength is stretched by the expansion of the universe. This means higher redshift corresponds to longer observed wavelengths (lower observed frequencies). We need to observe the *same spectral lines* from galaxies at different redshifts to measure their recessional velocities and map their distribution.

3. **Identify Key Spectral Lines:**  The most prominent and easily observable spectral line in radio astronomy for redshift surveys is the **21cm line of neutral hydrogen (HI)**. This line has a rest-frame frequency of 1420 MHz (approximately 1.4 GHz).

4. **Consider the Target Redshift Range:**  To study dark energy and its influence on large-scale structures, we need to observe galaxies at a significant range of redshifts. Let's consider some realistic redshift ranges and the corresponding observed frequencies of the 21cm line:

    * **Low Redshift (z ~ 0.1-0.5):**  Observed frequency will be 1420 MHz / (1 + z). For z=0.1, it's ~1290 MHz. For z=0.5, it's ~947 MHz.
    * **Intermediate Redshift (z ~ 1-2):** For z=1, it's ~710 MHz. For z=2, it's ~473 MHz.
    * **Higher Redshift (z ~ 3-5):** For z=3, it's ~355 MHz. For z=5, it's ~237 MHz.

5. **Evaluate the Provided Frequency Ranges:** Now, let's examine each given frequency range and see if it captures the redshifted 21cm line for relevant redshifts:

    * **a) 500 - 700 MHz:** This range corresponds to redshifts of approximately 1 to 1.8 (1420/700 - 1 = 1.03) to 0.03 (1420/500 - 1 = 1.84). This looks promising for intermediate redshifts.

    * **b) 300 - 450 MHz:** This range corresponds to redshifts of approximately 3.7 to 2.1 (1420/300 - 1 = 3.73) to 2.16 (1420/450 - 1 = 2.15). This covers higher redshifts.

    * **c) 1 GHz - 1.2 GHz:** This range corresponds to redshifts of approximately 0.42 to 0.18 (1420/1200 - 1 = 0.18) to 0.18 (1420/1000 - 1 = 0.42). This covers lower redshifts.

    * **d) 20 - 80 MHz:**  This range corresponds to very high redshifts (1420/80 - 1 = 16.75 to 1420/20 - 1 = 70). While theoretically interesting for the very early universe, it's unlikely to be the *primary* focus for constraining dark energy using *galaxy* redshift surveys, as these galaxies would be extremely faint and difficult to detect. Furthermore, ionospheric effects become significant at these low frequencies.

    * **e) 100 - 400 MHz:** This range corresponds to redshifts of approximately 13.2 to 2.5 (1420/100 - 1 = 13.2) to 2.55 (1420/400 - 1 = 2.55). This covers high redshifts.

6. **Determine the Best Combinations:**  To constrain dark energy, we want to map structures over a broad range of redshifts. Looking at the redshift coverage of each frequency range:

    * **a (500-700 MHz)** covers intermediate redshifts.
    * **b (300-450 MHz)** covers higher redshifts.
    * **c (1 GHz - 1.2 GHz)** covers lower redshifts.
    * **d (20-80 MHz)** covers very high redshifts (less practical for *galaxy* surveys focused on dark energy).
    * **e (100-400 MHz)** covers higher redshifts.

    The best combinations will be those that give the broadest redshift coverage.

    * **b and d:**  While covering a wide range, 'd' is less practical for the stated goal.
    * **a and e:** 'a' covers intermediate redshifts, and 'e' covers higher redshifts. This is a good combination.
    * **a and c:** 'a' covers intermediate redshifts, and 'c' covers lower redshifts. This is also a good combination.
    * **b and e:** Both cover higher redshifts, offering redundancy but not the widest range.

7. **Refine and Consider Practicalities:**  The 21cm line is the primary tool. Observing it across a wide range of redshifts is crucial. The ionosphere significantly impacts observations at frequencies below ~100 MHz, making 'd' less ideal for a ground-based telescope focused on *galaxy* surveys (other experiments might target that range for different purposes, like the Epoch of Reionization).

8. **Final Selection:** Considering the redshift coverage and the practicalities of observing the 21cm line, the combinations that provide a good range of redshifts are **a and e**, and **a and c**. Between these two, **a and e** provide a slightly higher redshift reach, allowing for observation of dark energy's influence at earlier times. However, the answer choices provided don't include 'a and c'. Therefore, the best fit from the given choices is **(B) a, e**.

    Let's double-check the other options:
    * **(A) b, d:** 'd' is less suitable due to ionospheric effects and the focus on galaxy surveys.
    * **(C) a, c:** This is a good combination, but not offered as an option.
    * **(D) b, e:** Both cover higher redshifts, limiting the overall redshift range.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer from the given choices is **(B)**.
