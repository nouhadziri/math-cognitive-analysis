Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Define the function \( g(x) \):**
   Let \( g(x) = \sin(f(x)) \). 

2. **Differentiate \( g(x) \):**
   We need to find the first and second derivatives of \( g(x) \) with respect to \( x \):
   \[
   g'(x) = \cos(f(x)) f'(x)
   \]
   \[
   g''(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \cos(f(x)) f'(x) \right)
   \]
   Using the product rule, we get:
   \[
   g''(x) = \cos(f(x)) f''(x) - \sin(f(x)) (f'(x))^2
   \]

3. **Substitute \( g''(x) \) into the given inequality:**
   The given inequality is:
   \[
   f''(x) \cos(f(x)) \geq (f'(x))^2 \sin(f(x))
   \]
   Substituting \( g''(x) \) from the previous step, we get:
   \[
   \cos(f(x)) f''(x) - \sin(f(x)) (f'(x))^2 \geq 0
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   g''(x) \geq 0
   \]
   Hence, \( g(x) = \sin(f(x)) \) is a convex function.

4. **Analyze the properties of \( g(x) \):**
   Since \( g(x) = \sin(f(x)) \) is bounded (as the sine function is bounded between -1 and 1) and convex, we can use the property that a bounded convex function on \( \mathbb{R} \) must be constant. 

5. **Conclude that \( g(x) \) is constant:**
   Since \( g(x) \) is constant, let \( g(x) = c \) for some constant \( c \). Therefore, \( \sin(f(x)) = c \).

6. **Determine the possible values of \( f(x) \):**
   Since \( \sin(f(x)) = c \), \( f(x) \) must be a constant function because the sine function is periodic and the only way for it to be constant is if its argument is constant. Thus, \( f(x) = \arcsin(c) \) for some constant \( c \).

7. **Verify the solution:**
   Any constant function \( f(x) = k \) where \( k \) is a constant satisfies the original inequality because:
   \[
   f''(x) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad f'(x) = 0
   \]
   Substituting these into the inequality:
   \[
   0 \cdot \cos(k) \geq 0 \cdot \sin(k)
   \]
   which is always true.

The final answer is \( \boxed{ f(x) = k } \) where \( k \) is a constant.

<text>**Define the function \( g(x) \):**
   Let \( g(x) = \sin(f(x)) \).</text>
<explanation>The solver strategically introduces a new function g(x) = sin(f(x)) to simplify the given inequality. This substitution transforms the problem by focusing on the sine component, which will later reveal important properties about the solution.

<text>**Differentiate \( g(x) \):**
   We need to find the first and second derivatives of \( g(x) \) with respect to \( x \):
   \[
   g'(x) = \cos(f(x)) f'(x)
   \]
   \[
   g''(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \cos(f(x)) f'(x) \right)

   Using the product rule, we get:
   \[
   g''(x) = \cos(f(x)) f''(x) - \sin(f(x)) (f'(x))^2
   \]</text>
<explanation>After introducing g(x), the solver calculates its derivatives, which is part of the strategic substitution approach. This shows how the substitution is being leveraged - by finding g'(x) and g''(x), they're setting up for a transformation of the original inequality into terms of g(x).</explanation>

   g'(x) = \cos(f(x)) f'(x)
   \]
   \[
   g''(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \cos(f(x)) f'(x) \right)
   \]
   Using the product rule, we get:
   \[
   g''(x) = \cos(f(x)) f''(x) - \sin(f(x)) (f'(x))^2

   The given inequality is:
   \[
   f''(x) \cos(f(x)) \geq (f'(x))^2 \sin(f(x))

   Substituting \( g''(x) \) from the previous step, we get:
   \[
   \cos(f(x)) f''(x) - \sin(f(x)) (f'(x))^2 \geq 0
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   g''(x) \geq 0
   \]
   Hence, \( g(x) = \sin(f(x)) \) is a convex function.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that the expression for g''(x) matches the left side of the original inequality, allowing them to rewrite the inequality simply as g''(x) ≥ 0.

<end>941</end>
<text>**Conclude that \( g(x) \) is constant:**
   Since \( g(x) \) is constant, let \( g(x) = c \) for some constant \( c \). Therefore, \( \sin(f(x)) = c \).</text>

<explanation>The solver uses logical deduction to reason that if sin(f(x)) is constant, then f(x) must also be constant. This involves understanding the properties of the sine function (periodicity) and deducing that the only way for sine to yield a constant value is if its input is constant.</explanation>

   \]
   Substituting these into the inequality:
   \[
   0 \cdot \cos(k) \geq 0 \cdot \sin(k)
   \]
   which is always true.

The final answer is \( \boxed{ f(x) = k } \) where \( k \) is a constant.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies their solution by substituting f(x) = k (where k is a constant) back into the original inequality to confirm that it satisfies the condition.

   \]
   Using the product rule, we get:
   \[
   g''(x) = \cos(f(x)) f''(x) - \sin(f(x)) (f'(x))^2
   \]

**Substitute \( g''(x) \) into the given inequality:**
   The given inequality is:
   \[
   f''(x) \cos(f(x)) \geq (f'(x))^2 \sin(f(x))
   \]
   Substituting \( g''(x) \) from the previous step, we get:

   \cos(f(x)) f''(x) - \sin(f(x)) (f'(x))^2 \geq 0
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   g''(x) \geq 0
   \]
   Hence, \( g(x) = \sin(f(x)) \) is a convex function.</text>
<explanation>The entire process from defining g(x) through deriving g''(x) and substituting into the original inequality represents a comprehensive problem transformation. The solver transforms a complex differential inequality into a simple statement about function convexity (g''(x) ≥ 0), which makes the problem much more tractable.
