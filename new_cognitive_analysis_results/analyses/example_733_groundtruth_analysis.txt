Problem:
You identified several new antigens in a refractory pancreatic solid tumor and want to target them with the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. You design your chimera so that the cytosolic side has a three-domain part with the activation domain at the C-terminus, and the monospecific scFv is at the extracellular side, following the transmembrane domain and a spacer. You pack the construct into the lentiviral vector and deliver them into the isolated CD8+ cells. After in vitro amplification and purification, you will infuse the cells into your experimental model organism and observe the reaction of the carcinoma. Which of the statements below is true?
Answer Choices:
(A) antibody part is at 3', and the signaling part is at 5' of the transforming vector
(B) your variable moiety recognizes multiple epitopes
(C) regulatory T cells are involved in tumor elimination
(D) tumor antigens are transported through the Golgi

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
The correct answer is that the tumor antigens are transported through the Golgi. After proteins of tumor cells are chopped up by the proteasome, they are loaded onto the MHC I class presentation molecule in the ER and matured in the Golgi. Atypical glycosylation of the tumor epitopes is what often makes them attractive for CAR T-cell therapy. 
In the vector construct, the antibody part is at 5', and the signaling part is at 3' because the cytosolic activation domain is at the C-terminus. The text mentions monospecific scFv; hence, it cannot recognize multiple epitopes. Finally, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are modified in the therapy and are involved in tumor elimination; the Treg cells often help tumor growth, as they suppress the immune system response.

Answer: D
