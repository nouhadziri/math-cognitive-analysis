Problem:
In quantum mechanics, when calculating the interaction between the electron with the proton in a hydrogen atom, it is necessary to compute the following volume integral (over all space):
$$
\mathbf{I}=\int \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})|\Psi(\mathbf{r})|^{2} d V
$$

where $\Psi(\mathbf{r})$ is the spatial wavefunction of the electron as a function of position $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})$ is the (boldface denotes vector) magnetic field produced by the proton at position $\mathbf{r}$. Suppose the proton is located at the origin and it acts like a finite-sized magnetic dipole (but much smaller than $a_{0}$ ) with dipole moment

$\mu_{p}=1.41 \times 10^{-26} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{T}$. Let the hydrogen atom be in the ground state, meaning $\Psi(\mathbf{r})=\frac{e^{-r / a_{0}}}{\sqrt{\pi a_{0}^{3}}}$, where $a_{0}=5.29 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{~m}$ is the Bohr radius. Evaluate the magnitude of the integral $|\mathbf{I}|$ (in SI units).

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
First, note that the result of the integral will be a vector in the direction the dipole is pointing, call it the z-direction. Thus we can replace $\mathbf{B}$ in the integral with $B_{z}$. Note that for any $R>0$, the integral over the space outside the sphere of radius $R$ is 0 . To show this, since $|\Psi|$ is exponentially decaying, we only need to show that the integral over a spherical shell is 0 . To show this, we can show that the integral of $\mathbf{B}$ inside a sphere of radius $R$ is independent of $R$. Indeed, this quickly follows from dimensional analysis (the only relevant quantities are $\mu_{0}, \mu_{p}$, and $R$, and one can check that $\mu_{0} \mu_{p}$ already gives the right dimensions, and there is no dimensionless combination of these 3 quantities. In fact, we will actually compute this integral at the end.)

Now, it suffices to compute the integral of $\mathbf{B}|\Psi|^{2}$ inside the sphere. Since $R$ was arbitrary, we can make it very small, much smaller than $a_{0}$. Then we can replace $|\Psi(\mathbf{r})|^{2}$ with $|\Psi(0)|^{2}=\frac{1}{\pi a_{0}^{3}}$, a constant that can be factored out. The problem reduces to computing the integral of $\mathbf{B}$ inside a sphere of radius $R$.

We can compute this integral by splitting the sphere up into many thin discs, all perpendicular to the $z$ axis. We have to add up the $\mathbf{B}$ field integrated over the volume of each disc, which is equivalent to the magnetic flux through the disc times the thickness of the disc. The magnetic flux through each disc can be calculated using the mutual inductance reciprocity theorem. Suppose a current $I$ goes around the boundary of the disc (a ring) with radius $r$. Then the mutual inductance $M$ between the ring and the dipole is given by the flux through the dipole divided by $I$ :

$$
M=\frac{B * A}{I}
$$

where $B$ is the magnetic field produced by the ring's current at the dipole's position, and $A$ is the area of the dipole. The dipole itself carries current $i=\frac{\mu_{p}}{A}$, so the flux through the ring is given by

$$
\Phi=M * i=\frac{B i A}{I}=\frac{\mu_{p} B}{I}
$$

where $B=\frac{\mu_{0} I}{4 \pi} * \frac{2 \pi r^{2}}{\left(r^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}=\frac{\mu_{0} I r^{2}}{2\left(r^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}$, where $z$ is the $z$ coordinate of the ring. Using $r=R \sin \theta$ and $z=R \cos \theta$, we obtain



$$
\Phi(\theta)=\frac{\mu_{0} \mu_{p} r^{2}}{2\left(r^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}=\frac{\mu_{0} \mu_{p} \sin ^{2} \theta}{2 R}
$$

Finally, we integrate over the thickness of the $\operatorname{disc} R \sin \theta d \theta$ to get :

$$
\int_{0}^{\pi} \Phi(\theta) R \sin \theta d \theta=\frac{1}{2} \mu_{0} \mu_{p} \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin ^{3} \theta d \theta=\frac{2}{3} \mu_{0} \mu_{p}
$$

Thus, $|\mathbf{I}|=\frac{2}{3} \mu_{0} \mu_{p} * \frac{1}{\pi a_{0}^{3}}=\frac{2 \mu_{0} \mu_{p}}{3 \pi a_{0}^{3}}=0.0254 \mathrm{~T}$.
