Problem:
You identified several new antigens in a refractory pancreatic solid tumor and want to target them with the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. You design your chimera so that the cytosolic side has a three-domain part with the activation domain at the C-terminus, and the monospecific scFv is at the extracellular side, following the transmembrane domain and a spacer. You pack the construct into the lentiviral vector and deliver them into the isolated CD8+ cells. After in vitro amplification and purification, you will infuse the cells into your experimental model organism and observe the reaction of the carcinoma. Which of the statements below is true?
Answer Choices:
(A) antibody part is at 3', and the signaling part is at 5' of the transforming vector
(B) your variable moiety recognizes multiple epitopes
(C) regulatory T cells are involved in tumor elimination
(D) tumor antigens are transported through the Golgi

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, let's see. So, the question is about designing a CAR T-cell therapy for a pancreatic tumor. There are four answer options, and I need to figure out which one is true. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, the CAR design: the cytosolic side has a three-domain part with the activation domain at the C-terminus. The extracellular side has a monospecific scFv, followed by a transmembrane domain and a spacer. They used a lentiviral vector to deliver the construct into CD8+ cells, which are then infused into a model organism to see the effect on the carcinoma.

The answer options are A to D. Let's analyze each one.

Option A: "antibody part is at 3', and the signaling part is at 5' of the transforming vector." Hmm. In genetic constructs, the orientation is important. Typically, in a viral vector, the promoter is at the 5' end, and the gene is transcribed from 5' to 3'. The CAR structure usually has an extracellular domain (scFv) followed by transmembrane and intracellular signaling domains. The scFv is the antigen recognition part (antibody), located extracellularly. The intracellular part includes signaling domains (like CD3ζ for activation). In a lentiviral vector, the gene is inserted in a certain orientation. For the CAR, the scFv would be encoded first (so at the 5' end of the vector), and the signaling domains would follow (towards the 3' end). Because the extracellular domain is the N-terminal part of the protein, the coding sequence for it would be at the 5' end. So if the antibody part (scFv) is at 3', that might be incorrect. Let me confirm. The CAR construct starts with the signal peptide, then scFv (extracellular), then spacer, transmembrane, then cytoplasmic domains ending with activation domain at C-terminus. The DNA sequence for the CAR would start with the scFv (5') and end with the activation domain (3'). If the vector's transforming construct has the antibody (scFv) at 3', that would place it after the signaling domains. That's probably backward. So A might be wrong. But I need to be careful with this. Because the vector is used to transduce the T cells; the gene construct would need to be in the correct reading frame. The scFv is part of the extracellular domain, which is encoded before the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. So DNA-wise, scFv would be at 5', signaling at 3'. That makes A incorrect, because it's saying antibody at 3' and signaling at 5'. So A is false.

Option B: "your variable moiety recognizes multiple epitopes." The CAR uses a monospecific scFv. Monospecific means it recognizes a single epitope. scFv is a single-chain variable fragment, composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of an antibody, connected by a linker. Since it's monospecific, it's specific to one antigen. So B is incorrect because they recognize only one epitope, not multiple.

Option C: "regulatory T cells are involved in tumor elimination." Regulatory T cells (Tregs) usually suppress immune responses. In tumor microenvironments, Tregs often inhibit the activity of effector T cells (like CD8+ cytotoxic T cells) which would attack the tumor. If the CAR T cells are CD8+, then their activation would lead them to kill tumor cells. Tregs would actually hinder that process. So C seems incorrect. Unless the CAR therapy somehow involves Tregs, but the question states that CD8+ cells are used. So C is probably false.

Option D: "tumor antigens are transported through the Golgi." Wait, in the CAR T therapy, the CAR on the T cell recognizes the antigen on the tumor cell surface. The tumor antigens in this context are presented on the tumor cell membrane (like a surface protein). Cells, including tumor cells, produce proteins through the ER and Golgi. For a surface antigen, the tumor cell would produce the protein via the ER, then transported via Golgi to the cell membrane. So the tumor antigens are indeed transported through the Golgi. But is D the correct answer? Let me check if the question is about the CAR T cell components. The scFv part of the CAR is produced by the T cells. The scFv would be made in the T cell's ER, then transported via Golgi to the cell surface. But the question's option D says "tumor antigens are transported through the Golgi," referring to the tumor's own antigens. The antigens targeted by the CAR are on the tumor cell surface. These would have been synthesized by the tumor cells, so their production involves the ER and Golgi. So their transport to the cell surface does go through the Golgi. Therefore, D is true. But let me make sure the question isn't mixing this up. The tumor's antigens (i.e., the proteins on the tumor cell surface that the CAR recognizes) are processed through the tumor's Golgi, correct. So D is a correct statement. Let me cross-check. The Golgi is indeed involved in the transport and modification of proteins to the cell membrane. Therefore, D is true. The other options: A incorrect, B incorrect (monospecific), C incorrect, so D is correct.
