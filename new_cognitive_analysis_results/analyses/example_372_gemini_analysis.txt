Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the value of $P(\tfrac72)$ given a functional equation involving a polynomial $P(x)$ and a condition on the values of $P(2)$ and $P(3)$.

The given functional equation is $(x-1)P(x+1)=(x+2)P(x)$.

First, let's find the roots of the polynomial $P(x)$.
If $x=1$, then $(1-1)P(1+1) = (1+2)P(1)$, so $0 = 3P(1)$, which implies $P(1) = 0$.
Thus, $x=1$ is a root of $P(x)$, so $P(x) = (x-1)Q(x)$ for some polynomial $Q(x)$.

Substitute $P(x) = (x-1)Q(x)$ into the functional equation:
$(x-1)((x+1)-1)Q(x+1) = (x+2)(x-1)Q(x)$
$(x-1)x Q(x+1) = (x+2)(x-1)Q(x)$

If $x \neq 1$, we can divide by $(x-1)$:
$x Q(x+1) = (x+2)Q(x)$

This is a new functional equation for $Q(x)$.

Let's find the roots of $Q(x)$.
If $x=0$, then $0 \cdot Q(1) = (0+2)Q(0)$, so $0 = 2Q(0)$, which implies $Q(0) = 0$.
Thus, $x=0$ is a root of $Q(x)$, so $Q(x) = x R(x)$ for some polynomial $R(x)$.

Substitute $Q(x) = x R(x)$ into the equation $x Q(x+1) = (x+2)Q(x)$:
$x ((x+1) R(x+1)) = (x+2) (x R(x))$
$x(x+1) R(x+1) = x(x+2) R(x)$

If $x \neq 0$, we can divide by $x$:
$(x+1) R(x+1) = (x+2) R(x)$

This is a new functional equation for $R(x)$.

Let's analyze the equation $(x+1) R(x+1) = (x+2) R(x)$.
If $R(x)$ is a constant $c$, then $(x+1)c = (x+2)c$, so $cx+c = cx+2c$, which implies $c = 2c$, so $c=0$.
If $R(x) = 0$, then $P(x) = 0$, which contradicts the problem statement that $P(x)$ is a nonzero polynomial.

Consider the case when $R(x)$ is not identically zero.
Let $x=-1$, then $(-1+1) R(0) = (-1+2) R(-1)$, so $0 = 1 \cdot R(-1)$, which means $R(-1) = 0$.
Thus, $(x+1)$ is a factor of $R(x)$, so $R(x) = (x+1) S(x)$ for some polynomial $S(x)$.

Substitute $R(x) = (x+1) S(x)$ into the equation $(x+1) R(x+1) = (x+2) R(x)$:
$(x+1) ((x+1)+1) S(x+1) = (x+2) (x+1) S(x)$
$(x+1)(x+2) S(x+1) = (x+2)(x+1) S(x)$

If $x \neq -1$ and $x \neq -2$, then $S(x+1) = S(x)$.
This means $S(x)$ is a periodic polynomial with period 1. The only such polynomials are constants.
So, $S(x) = c$ for some constant $c$.

Therefore, $R(x) = c(x+1)$.
Then $Q(x) = x R(x) = cx(x+1)$.
And $P(x) = (x-1)Q(x) = c(x-1)x(x+1)$.

So, $P(x) = c x(x-1)(x+1)$ for some constant $c$.

Now, use the condition $\left(P(2)\right)^2 = P(3)$.
$P(2) = c \cdot 2 \cdot (2-1) \cdot (2+1) = c \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 = 6c$.
$P(3) = c \cdot 3 \cdot (3-1) \cdot (3+1) = c \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 = 24c$.

Substitute these into the condition:
$(6c)^2 = 24c$
$36c^2 = 24c$
$36c^2 - 24c = 0$
$12c(3c - 2) = 0$

This gives $c=0$ or $3c-2=0$, so $c=0$ or $c=\frac23$.
Since $P(x)$ is a nonzero polynomial, we must have $c \neq 0$.
Therefore, $c = \frac23$.

So, the polynomial is $P(x) = \frac23 x(x-1)(x+1)$.

We need to find $P(\tfrac72)$.
$P(\tfrac72) = \frac23 \cdot \frac72 \cdot (\frac72 - 1) \cdot (\frac72 + 1)$
$P(\tfrac72) = \frac23 \cdot \frac72 \cdot (\frac72 - \frac22) \cdot (\frac72 + \frac22)$
$P(\tfrac72) = \frac23 \cdot \frac72 \cdot \frac52 \cdot \frac92$
$P(\tfrac72) = \frac{2 \cdot 7 \cdot 5 \cdot 9}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{630}{24}$

Simplify the fraction $\frac{630}{24}$.
Divide by 2: $\frac{315}{12}$.
Divide by 3: $\frac{105}{4}$.

So, $P(\tfrac72) = \frac{105}{4}$.
We are given $P(\tfrac72) = \frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.
$m = 105$, $n = 4$.
Check if $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
Prime factors of 105: $3, 5, 7$ (since $105 = 5 \times 21 = 5 \times 3 \times 7$).
Prime factors of 4: $2$.
So, $\gcd(105, 4) = 1$.

We need to find $m+n = 105 + 4 = 109$.

Let's double check the derivation.

The functional equation is $(x-1)P(x+1)=(x+2)P(x)$.

Consider the roots of $P(x)$.
If $x=1$, $0 = 3P(1)$, so $P(1)=0$.
If $x=-2$, $(-2-1)P(-2+1) = (-2+2)P(-2)$, so $-3P(-1) = 0$, so $P(-1)=0$.

Let $x=0$, $(-1)P(1) = (2)P(0)$. Since $P(1)=0$, we have $0 = 2P(0)$, so $P(0)=0$.

The roots of $P(x)$ are $0, 1, -1$.
So, $P(x) = A x(x-1)(x+1)$ for some constant $A$. This matches the form we found earlier, with $A=c$.

Now, use the condition $\left(P(2)\right)^2 = P(3)$.
$P(2) = A \cdot 2 \cdot (2-1) \cdot (2+1) = A \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 = 6A$.
$P(3) = A \cdot 3 \cdot (3-1) \cdot (3+1) = A \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 = 24A$.

$(6A)^2 = 24A$
$36A^2 = 24A$
$36A^2 - 24A = 0$
$12A(3A - 2) = 0$
Since $P(x)$ is nonzero, $A \neq 0$, so $3A-2=0$, $A=\frac23$.

Thus, $P(x) = \frac23 x(x-1)(x+1)$.

Calculate $P(\tfrac72)$:
$P(\tfrac72) = \frac23 \cdot \frac72 \cdot (\frac72 - 1) \cdot (\frac72 + 1) = \frac23 \cdot \frac72 \cdot \frac52 \cdot \frac92 = \frac{630}{24} = \frac{105}{4}$.

So, $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{105}{4}$.
$m = 105$, $n = 4$.
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

$m+n = 105 + 4 = 109$.

Let's think about potential pitfalls or alternative approaches.
The functional equation can be written as $\frac{P(x+1)}{P(x)} = \frac{x+2}{x-1}$.

Consider the gamma function property $\frac{\Gamma(z+1)}{\Gamma(z)} = z$.
We have a ratio of polynomial values at consecutive arguments.

Let $P(x) = c \Gamma(x+a) f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is periodic with period 1.
This seems overly complicated for a polynomial.

Consider the degrees of the polynomials on both sides of the functional equation.
Let the degree of $P(x)$ be $d$.
Degree of $(x-1)P(x+1)$ is $1 + d$.
Degree of $(x+2)P(x)$ is $1 + d$.
The degrees match, which is consistent.

Consider the leading coefficients.
Let $P(x) = a_d x^d + \text{lower terms}$.
$P(x+1) = a_d (x+1)^d + \dots = a_d (x^d + dx^{d-1} + \dots) + \dots = a_d x^d + da_d x^{d-1} + \dots$
$(x-1)P(x+1) = (x-1)(a_d x^d + da_d x^{d-1} + \dots) = a_d x^{d+1} + (da_d - a_d) x^d + \dots = a_d x^{d+1} + (d-1)a_d x^d + \dots$
$(x+2)P(x) = (x+2)(a_d x^d + \dots) = a_d x^{d+1} + 2a_d x^d + \dots$

Equating the coefficients of $x^{d+1}$: $a_d = a_d$, which gives no information.
Equating the coefficients of $x^d$: $(d-1)a_d = 2a_d$.
Since $a_d \neq 0$ (because $P(x)$ is nonzero), we have $d-1 = 2$, so $d=3$.
The degree of the polynomial is 3.

This confirms that our form $P(x) = c x(x-1)(x+1)$ is of degree 3.

Alternative way to find the form of $P(x)$:
From $\frac{P(x+1)}{P(x)} = \frac{x+2}{x-1}$, we have:
$\frac{P(x+1)}{x+2} = \frac{P(x)}{x-1}$.

Let $Q(x) = \frac{P(x)}{x-1}$. Then $Q(x+1) = \frac{P(x+1)}{(x+1)-1} = \frac{P(x+1)}{x}$.
The equation becomes $\frac{x Q(x+1)}{x+2} = Q(x)$.
$x Q(x+1) = (x+2) Q(x)$.

This is the same functional equation we got for $Q(x)$.
Repeating the process, let $R(x) = \frac{Q(x)}{x}$. Then $R(x+1) = \frac{Q(x+1)}{x+1}$.
$x (x+1) R(x+1) = (x+2) x R(x)$.
$(x+1) R(x+1) = (x+2) R(x)$.

Let $S(x) = \frac{R(x)}{x+1}$. Then $S(x+1) = \frac{R(x+1)}{x+2}$.
$R(x+1) = (x+2) S(x+1)$.
$(x+1) (x+2) S(x+1) = (x+2) (x+1) S(x)$.
$S(x+1) = S(x)$.

Since $S(x)$ is a polynomial and $S(x+1) = S(x)$, $S(x)$ must be a constant, say $c$.
$S(x) = c$.
$R(x) = c(x+1)$.
$Q(x) = x R(x) = cx(x+1)$.
$P(x) = (x-1) Q(x) = c(x-1)x(x+1)$.

This confirms the form of $P(x)$ without explicitly finding the roots first.

Final check of calculations.
$P(\tfrac72) = \frac23 \cdot \frac72 \cdot \frac52 \cdot \frac92 = \frac{2 \cdot 7 \cdot 5 \cdot 9}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{630}{24}$.
Dividing by 6: $\frac{105}{4}$.
$m=105$, $n=4$.
$\gcd(105, 4) = 1$.
$m, n$ are positive integers.
$m+n = 105 + 4 = 109$.

The problem seems straightforward once the form of the polynomial is determined. The key steps are finding the roots or using the ratio form of the functional equation. The condition on $P(2)$ and $P(3)$ is used to find the constant factor.
