Problem:
Consider a file with a size of 350 Kbytes storing in a web server. Client A sends a request to the server to retrieve the file from a remote location. It is known that the link capacity between client A and the server is 10 Mbps and the round trip time (RTT) between the server and client is fixed at 20ms. Assume that the segment size is 20 Kbytes and the client has a receiver buffer of 200Kbytes. Assume that the window size (W) is adjusted according to the congestion control procedures of TCP-Reno. How long (in ms) does client A take to receive the whole file from the server after sending a request? Given that the initial slow-start threshold is 32.

<text>344</text>
<explanation>Although the thinking trajectory is minimal, arriving at 344 ms requires understanding TCP-Reno's congestion control procedures, including slow start and congestion avoidance phases, which are mentioned in the problem. The solver needed to apply knowledge of how TCP window sizes change during transmission.</explanation>

<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>344</text>
<explanation>To arrive at this answer, the solver would have needed to convert between Kbytes and Mbps, ensuring that units are consistent throughout the calculation. This involves understanding that 350 Kbytes is the file size, 10 Mbps is the link capacity, and 20 Kbytes is the segment size.</explanation>
