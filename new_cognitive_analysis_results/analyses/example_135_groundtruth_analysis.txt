Problem:
We are planning to construct a ground based radio telescope with the purpose of conducting a galaxy-redshift survey aimed at studying dark energy. This telescope will map large-scale structures, such as galaxy clusters, at various redshifts, utilizing the collected data to constrain the equation of state related to dark energy. We want to determine the appropriate frequency coverage for this telescope which is suitable for such experiment. Which combination of the following frequency coverages is suitable for constraining dark energy equation of states ?
a) 500 - 700 MHz
b) 300 - 450 MHz
c) 1 GHz - 1.2 GHz
d) 20 - 80 MHz
e) 100 - 400 MHz
Answer Choices:
(A) b , d
(B) a , e
(C) a , c
(D) b , e

Domain: Combinatorics

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Large scale structure are mostly made of hydrogen. In this question, the following information is given:  1) we want to measure large scale structures such as galaxy clusters with radio telescope 2) We want to study dark energy.
Since we want to study dark energy, the redshift of the observed objects should be smaller than ~2 (dark energy starts to dominate at this redshift). And because we want to conduct radio observations of large scale structures, we should find emission/absorption lines emitted by large scale structures at redshift <2.  The only relevant atomic transition here is hyperfine transition of hydrogen atoms (because large scale structures are mostly made up of hydrogen). Rest frame frequency of this transition (i.e. at redshift 0) is 1.4 GHz. With the expansion of the universe, this frequency is shifted to lower frequencies and at redshift 2, it would be ~467 MHz. So, frequency range for such telescope should be between 467 MHz to 1.4 GHz. Radio telescopes like SKA or CHIME can map large scale structures using 21-cm emission line which is due to hyperfine transition in the hydrogen atom.
