Problem:
In general, whenever an electric and a magnetic field are at an angle to each other, energy is transferred; for example, this principle is the reason electromagnetic radiation transfers energy. The power transferred per unit area is given by the Poynting vector:

$$
\vec{S}=\frac{1}{\mu_{0}} \vec{E} \times \vec{B}
$$

In each part of this problem, the last subpart asks you to verify that the rate of energy transfer agrees with the formula for the Poynting vector. Therefore, you should not use the formula for the Poynting vector before the last subpart!

A long, insulating cylindrical rod has radius $R$ and carries a uniform volume charge density $\rho$. A uniform external electric field $E$ exists in the direction of its axis. The rod moves in the direction of its axis at speed $v$.

Compute the Poynting vector, draw its direction on a diagram, and verify that it agrees with the rate of energy transfer.

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
The electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular, so the Poynting vector has magnitude

$$
S=\frac{1}{\mu_{0}} E B=\frac{1}{2} R \rho v E
$$

A quick application of the right hand rule indicates that it points inward along the surface of the cylinder, as it ought. The cylinder has area per unit length $2 \pi r$, so the rate of energy transfer per unit length is

$$
\mathcal{P}=2 \pi r S=\pi R^{2} \rho v E
$$

in agreement with the previous result.
