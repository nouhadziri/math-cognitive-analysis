Problem:
e. Calculate the projected physical separation, $r_{p}$, between the galaxy and the Voorwerp.g. High precision measurements showed that the Voorwerp is slightly further away than the galaxy, and so $\theta=125^{\circ}$. Use this with your expression from the previous part of the question to estimate an upper limit for the number of years that have passed since the quasar was last active.

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta t=\frac{r_{p}}{c \sin \theta}(1-\cos \theta) \quad & =\frac{20.8 \times 10^{3} \times 3.09 \times 10^{16}}{3.00 \times 10^{8} \times \sin 125^{\circ}}\left(1-\cos 125^{\circ}\right) \\
& =4.11 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{~s} \\
& \approx 130000 \text { years }
\end{aligned}
$$

(This is remarkably recent on astronomical timescales!)

<start>0</start>
<end>65</end>
<text>\Delta t=\frac{r_{p}}{c \sin \theta}(1-\cos \theta)</text>
<explanation>The solver begins by writing down the formula that relates the time difference (Δt) to the physical separation (r_p), the speed of light (c), and the angle θ. This demonstrates the ability to recall and correctly apply a formula that was likely derived in a previous part of the question.</explanation>

<skill>Numerical Substitution</skill>
<definition>The process of replacing variables in a mathematical expression with their corresponding numerical values to perform calculations.</definition>
