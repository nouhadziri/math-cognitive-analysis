Problem:

Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, let's try to figure out how to show that f equals g on the interval [0, 1]. So, the problem says that K(x, y), f(x), and g(x) are all positive and continuous on [0, 1]. We have these two integral equations:

1. The integral of f(y) times K(x, y) from 0 to 1 with respect to y equals g(x).
2. The integral of g(y) times K(x, y) from 0 to 1 with respect to y equals f(x).

And we need to show that f and g are the same function on [0, 1]. Alright, let's start by writing down what we have formally.

First equation:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} f(y) K(x, y) \, dy = g(x)
\]
Second equation:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} g(y) K(x, y) \, dy = f(x)
\]

So, each function is transformed into the other via integration against the kernel K(x, y). This seems like some kind of symmetry between f and g through the operator defined by K. Maybe if we substitute one into the other, we can get an equation involving only f or only g?

Let me try substituting. Let's plug the expression for g(x) from the first equation into the second equation. So, we have:

f(x) = ∫01 g(y) K(x, y) dy

But g(y) itself is ∫01 f(z) K(y, z) dz from the first equation. So substituting that into the equation above:

f(x) = ∫01 [ ∫01 f(z) K(y, z) dz ] K(x, y) dy

Interchange the order of integration (since everything is positive and continuous, Fubini's theorem should allow this):

f(x) = ∫01 f(z) [ ∫01 K(y, z) K(x, y) dy ] dz

Similarly, if we start with the second equation and substitute the first into it, maybe we get a similar expression for g(x). Let's check.

g(x) = ∫01 f(y) K(x, y) dy

But f(y) is ∫01 g(z) K(y, z) dz from the second equation. So substitute that into g(x):

g(x) = ∫01 [ ∫01 g(z) K(y, z) dz ] K(x, y) dy

Again, switch the order of integration:

g(x) = ∫01 g(z) [ ∫01 K(y, z) K(x, y) dy ] dz

Wait a second, both f(x) and g(x) are expressed as the same integral operator applied to themselves. Let's denote the double integral kernel as L(x, z) = ∫01 K(y, z) K(x, y) dy. Then, both equations become:

f(x) = ∫01 f(z) L(x, z) dz

g(x) = ∫01 g(z) L(x, z) dz

So both f and g are eigenfunctions of the integral operator defined by L(x, z) with eigenvalue 1. Hmm, interesting. But eigenvalues of integral operators aren't always 1, but here both f and g are corresponding to eigenvalue 1. However, without knowing more about L(x, z), I might not be able to proceed directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the ratio of f and g. Let me see.

Suppose we let h(x) = f(x) / g(x). Since both f and g are positive and continuous on [0,1], h(x) is also positive and continuous. Let's see if we can derive some equation for h(x).

From the first equation, we have:

g(x) = ∫01 f(y) K(x, y) dy = ∫01 h(y) g(y) K(x, y) dy

Similarly, from the second equation:

f(x) = ∫01 g(y) K(x, y) dy

But f(x) is h(x) g(x), so:

h(x) g(x) = ∫01 g(y) K(x, y) dy

Now, from the first modified equation, g(x) = ∫01 h(y) g(y) K(x, y) dy

So we have:

g(x) = ∫01 h(y) g(y) K(x, y) dy

and

h(x) g(x) = ∫01 g(y) K(x, y) dy

Thus, substituting the second equation into the first, or maybe comparing the two.

Wait, let's try expressing the second equation in terms of h(x):

h(x) = [∫01 g(y) K(x, y) dy] / g(x)

And the first modified equation says that 1 = [∫01 h(y) g(y) K(x, y) dy] / g(x). Therefore, h(x) is [∫01 g(y) K(x, y) dy]/g(x), and substituting that into the first equation's modified version seems tangled. Maybe this approach isn't the best.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider taking the difference of f and g. Let’s define d(x) = f(x) - g(x). If we can show that d(x) is zero everywhere, then f = g.

From the given equations, we have:

g(x) = ∫01 f(y) K(x, y) dy

f(x) = ∫01 g(y) K(x, y) dy

Subtracting the two equations:

f(x) - g(x) = ∫01 g(y) K(x, y) dy - ∫01 f(y) K(x, y) dy = ∫01 [g(y) - f(y)] K(x, y) dy

Thus,

d(x) = -∫01 d(y) K(x, y) dy

So, d(x) + ∫01 d(y) K(x, y) dy = 0

But d(x) = -∫01 d(y) K(x, y) dy, which is similar to an integral equation. If K is positive and continuous, maybe d(x) must be zero?

Wait, here's an idea. Let's consider the integral operator T defined by (Tφ)(x) = ∫01 φ(y) K(x, y) dy. Then, the given equations are Tf = g and Tg = f. So, applying T twice, we get T2f = Tg = f. Hence, T2f = f, so f is an eigenfunction of T2 with eigenvalue 1.

Similarly, since Tg = f, then T2g = Tf = g, so g is also an eigenfunction of T2 with eigenvalue 1. However, without knowing more about T, perhaps it's difficult.

But since K is positive and continuous, maybe we can use some properties of positive operators. For instance, by the Krein-Rutman theorem, which is a generalization of the Perron-Frobenius theorem to infinite-dimensional spaces, the operator T should have a unique positive eigenfunction (up to scaling) corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. But in our case, both f and g are positive functions, and they might be related to this principal eigenfunction.

But how can this be applied here? If T2f = f and T2g = g, perhaps this suggests that f and g are eigenfunctions of T2 with eigenvalue 1. If the eigenvalue 1 is the largest eigenvalue for T2, then by Krein-Rutman, the corresponding eigenfunction is unique up to scaling. Since f and g are both positive, maybe they must be scalar multiples of each other. If that's the case, then perhaps we can show that the scalar multiple must be 1.

Wait, let me see. Suppose that T2f = f and Tf = g. If f is an eigenfunction of T2, then so is g. If the eigenspace is one-dimensional, then f and g must be scalar multiples. However, T2 is a compact operator (since K is continuous, hence T is Hilbert-Schmidt), so its eigenvalues are isolated and have finite multiplicities. If 1 is an eigenvalue of T2 with multiplicity 1, then any two eigenfunctions are scalar multiples. But in that case, if f = cg for some constant c, substituting into the first equation: Tg = f = cg, so Tg = cg, meaning that g is an eigenfunction of T with eigenvalue c. Then applying T again: T2g = T(cg) = c Tg = c2g. But we also have T2g = g (from our previous conclusion), so c2g = g. Since g is positive and non-zero, this implies c2 = 1, hence c=1 or c=-1. But since f and g are both positive, c must be positive, so c=1. Therefore, f = g.

So, this line of reasoning suggests that if 1 is the leading eigenvalue with a one-dimensional eigenspace, then f and g must be equal. But to apply this, we need to know that 1 is indeed the leading eigenvalue and that the eigenspace is one-dimensional. However, the problem statement does not specify any conditions on K beyond positivity and continuity. So maybe there's a different approach.

Alternatively, let's consider the function f/g. Let h(x) = f(x)/g(x), which is well-defined because both are positive. Then, let's see what the equations say.

From the first equation, we have:
g(x) = ∫01 f(y) K(x, y) dy = ∫01 h(y) g(y) K(x, y) dy

From the second equation:
f(x) = h(x) g(x) = ∫01 g(y) K(x, y) dy

Dividing the second equation by g(x) (since g(x) is positive):
h(x) = ∫01 [g(y)/g(x)] K(x, y) dy

But we also have from the first modified equation:
1 = ∫01 h(y) [g(y) K(x, y)/g(x)] dy

So, combining the two equations:

h(x) = ∫01 [g(y)/g(x)] K(x, y) dy

1 = ∫01 h(y) [g(y)/g(x)] K(x, y) dy

But that seems similar. Let's denote the kernel M(x, y) = [g(y)/g(x)] K(x, y). Then:

h(x) = ∫01 M(x, y) dy

1 = ∫01 h(y) M(x, y) dy

If we consider h(x) as a function, then h(x) is the integral of M(x, y) over y, and also the integral of h(y) M(x, y) over y equals 1.

But unless M(x, y) has some specific structure, I don't know if that yields h(x) = 1.

Alternatively, if we assume h is a constant function, then h(x) = c. Then from h(x) = ∫01 M(x, y) dy = c, and 1 = ∫01 c M(x, y) dy = c * h(x) = c2. Therefore, c2 = 1, so c=1 (since c>0). Therefore, if h is constant, then c=1, so f = g. But does h have to be constant?

Given that M(x, y) depends on x and y, unless the kernel M(x, y) has some symmetry or other properties, h could potentially vary with x. However, maybe the combination of the two equations forces h(x) to be constant.

Alternatively, let's think about the equations again. From the original problem, we have that applying the operator twice brings us back to the original function. So, Tf = g and Tg = f, so T2f = f. Similarly, T2g = g.

If the operator T is positive definite or something, maybe T has a unique fixed point, which would mean that f = g, but I think we need more structure.

Wait, let me recall that if an operator T is such that its composition squared is the identity on the cone of positive functions, then perhaps T is invertible and its inverse is itself. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, consider the function d(x) = f(x) - g(x). As before, d(x) satisfies:

d(x) = -∫01 d(y) K(x, y) dy

So d is equal to the negative integral of itself against K. Since K is positive everywhere and d is continuous, suppose that d is not identically zero. Then, if d is positive somewhere, since it's continuous, it must be positive on some interval, but integrating against K(x, y), which is positive, so the right-hand side, -∫01 d(y) K(x, y) dy, would be negative for all x. Therefore, if d is positive somewhere, then in those x where d(x) is positive, we have that d(x) equals a negative number, which would be a contradiction. Similarly, if d is negative somewhere, then d(x) would equal a positive number due to the negative sign, leading again to a contradiction. Thus, d(x) must be identically zero, so f = g.

Wait, let me formalize that.

Assume for contradiction that there exists a point x0 where d(x0) > 0. Since d is continuous, there exists an interval around x0 where d(x) > 0. Then, evaluating d(x0) = -∫01 d(y) K(x0, y) dy. But since d(y) is positive on some interval and non-negative elsewhere (as K is positive everywhere and d is continuous), the integral ∫01 d(y) K(x0, y) dy is positive, so d(x0) is negative. However, we supposed d(x0) > 0, which is a contradiction. Similarly, if d(x0) < 0, then the integral ∫01 d(y) K(x0, y) dy would be negative (since d(y) is negative on an interval and K is positive), so -∫ ... would be positive, implying d(x0) > 0, again a contradiction. Therefore, d(x) cannot be positive or negative anywhere, so it must be identically zero. Therefore, f = g on [0,1].

Yes, this seems like a plausible approach. By considering the difference and using the positivity of the kernel, the only continuous solution is the zero function. Therefore, f and g must coincide.

So, to recap, if we subtract the two integral equations, we find that the difference d = f - g satisfies d(x) = -∫01 d(y) K(x, y) dy. Suppose d is not identically zero. Then, since K is positive, the integral of d(y) times K(x, y) would have the same sign as d(y) in regions where d(y) is non-zero. However, in such regions, this integral's sign would contradict the sign of d(x), leading to a contradiction. Therefore, d must be zero everywhere, so f = g.

Alternatively, since d(x) is equal to the negative of its integral transform, then the maximum of d(x) would have to be non-positive, and the minimum non-negative, hence d(x)=0.

Right, here's another way. Since K is positive and continuous on [0,1]x[0,1], it's bounded below by some positive constant? Not necessarily. But at least it's continuous on a compact set, so it's bounded. Maybe use the maximum principle.

Let M = max_{x ∈ [0,1]} d(x). Suppose that M > 0. Then, there exists x0 such that d(x0) = M. Then,

d(x0) = -∫01 d(y) K(x0, y) dy

But since d(y) ≤ M for all y, and K(x0, y) > 0, the integral is ≤ M ∫01 K(x0, y) dy. Therefore,

M = |d(x0)| = | -∫01 d(y) K(x0, y) dy | ≤ ∫01 |d(y)| K(x0, y) dy ≤ M ∫01 K(x0, y) dy

Now, unless ∫01 K(x0, y) dy ≥ 1, we might not get equality. Hmm. But how to relate this.

Alternatively, since the operator S defined by Sφ(x) = ∫01 φ(y) K(x, y) dy is a positive operator, and we're saying that d(x) = -S d(x). If the spectral radius of S is less than 1, then the only solution would be d=0. But if it's not... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, since d(x) = -S d(x), we can write (I + S) d = 0, where I is the identity operator. If I + S is invertible, then d=0. But to see if I + S is invertible... This might require more advanced functional analysis.

But perhaps to use the positivity of the kernel and the function.

Suppose that d is not identically zero. Let’s take x_1 where |d(x)| achieves its maximum, say M > 0. Then,

|d(x_1)| = | - ∫01 d(y) K(x_1, y) dy | ≤ ∫01 |d(y)| K(x_1, y) dy ≤ M ∫01 K(x_1, y) dy

Thus,

M ≤ M ∫01 K(x_1, y) dy

Which implies that ∫01 K(x_1, y) dy ≥ 1. However, since K is continuous on [0,1]x[0,1], then ∫01 K(x, y) dy is a continuous function of x. Therefore, if there's an x such that the integral of K(x, y) dy over [0,1] is greater or equal to 1, we might not get a contradiction.

But we can’t rule this out because K is just given as positive and continuous. Maybe ∫ K(x,y) dy is greater than or equal to 1 for some x. So this approach might not yield a contradiction immediately.

Alternatively, perhaps we can iterate the equation. If d = -Sd, then substituting back in, d = -S(-Sd) = S2 d. Then, d = S2d. So S2d = d. And in this case, S2 is a positive operator. Then we can apply the argument for positive operators again. Suppose d is non-negative (if d is somewhere positive), then S2d = d would imply that d is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue 1 for S2. But again, it's not immediately helpful.

Alternatively, take the inner product with d. Suppose we work in L^2([0,1]). Let's take the inner product of both sides with d:

⟨d, d⟩ = ⟨ -S d, d ⟩ = - ⟨ S d, d ⟩

But ⟨ S d, d ⟩ = ∫01 (S d)(x) d(x) dx = ∫01 [∫01 K(x, y) d(y) dy ] d(x) dx = ∫01 ∫01 K(x, y) d(y) d(x) dy dx

By Fubini's theorem, this is ∫01 ∫01 K(x, y) d(x) d(y) dx dy. But since K(x, y) is positive, and if d is non-negative (or non-positive) somewhere, this integral is positive. However, the left-hand side is ⟨d, d⟩ = ||d||2 ≥ 0, and it's equal to -⟨ S d, d ⟩. But since ⟨ S d, d ⟩ is positive (because K is positive and d is non-zero somewhere), then ||d||2 = -⟨ S d, d ⟩ implies that ||d||2 ≤ 0, hence d = 0. Thus, this gives a contradiction unless d=0, so f= g.

Wait, that actually holds!

Let me check again. If d satisfies d = -S d, taking inner product with d, we have:

⟨d, d⟩ = - ⟨ S d, d ⟩

Thus,

||d||2 = - ∫01 ∫01 K(x, y) d(y) d(x) dy dx

But the double integral is ∫01 ∫01 K(x, y) d(x) d(y) dx dy. Since K(x, y) is positive and d is real-valued (since f and g are positive), then if d is not identically zero, the double integral is positive. Thus, the right-hand side is the negative of a positive number, so it's negative. However, the left-hand side ||d||2 is non-negative. Therefore, the only possibility is that d=0. Thus, f = g.

Perfect! That works. So by taking the inner product with d, we derive that the squared norm of d is equal to the negative of a positive quantity, which is possible only if that positive quantity is zero. Therefore, d must be zero. Hence, f = g.

So, the key idea here was to use the properties of the integral operator and take the inner product to derive a contradiction unless d=0. This works because the kernel K is positive, hence making the double integral strictly positive unless d is identically zero.

Therefore, after going through various approaches—substituting equations, considering eigenfunctions, maximum principles—it turns out the most straightforward way is to use the inner product and the fact that the kernel is positive definite, leading us to conclude that the difference function must be zero. Therefore, f and g must be equal on [0,1].

**Final Answer**
\boxed{f = g}

But since d(y) is positive on some interval and non-negative elsewhere (as K is positive everywhere and d is continuous), the integral ∫01 d(y) K(x0, y) dy is positive, so d(x0) is negative. However, we supposed d(x0) > 0, which is a contradiction.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses proof by contradiction, assuming d(x₀) > 0 at some point and deriving a logical contradiction to show that d cannot be positive anywhere.</explanation>

<end>9334</end>
<text>But since ⟨ S d, d ⟩ is positive (because K is positive and d is non-zero somewhere), then ||d||2 = -⟨ S d, d ⟩ implies that ||d||2 ≤ 0, hence d = 0. Thus, this gives a contradiction unless d=0, so f= g.</text>
<explanation>The solver establishes a contradiction by showing that if d is not identically zero, then its squared norm would have to be both non-negative (by definition) and negative (from the derived equation), which is impossible.</explanation>

<end>9819</end>
<text>Let me check again. If d satisfies d = -S d, taking inner product with d, we have:

⟨d, d⟩ = - ⟨ S d, d ⟩

Thus,

||d||2 = - ∫01 ∫01 K(x, y) d(y) d(x) dy dx

But the double integral is ∫01 ∫01 K(x, y) d(x) d(y) dx dy. Since K(x, y) is positive and d is real-valued (since f and g are positive), then if d is not identically zero, the double integral is positive. Thus, the right-hand side is the negative of a positive number, so it's negative. However, the left-hand side ||d||2 is non-negative. Therefore, the only possibility is that d=0. Thus, f = g.</text>
<explanation>The solver carefully checks the contradiction argument, showing that if d is not zero, its squared norm would have to be both non-negative (by definition of norm) and negative (from the equation), which is impossible, thus d must be zero.</explanation>

SUMMARY_START
The most important cognitive skills demonstrated in this mathematical problem-solving process are:

1. Adaptive Problem-Solving - The solver persistently tries multiple approaches when initial methods don't yield results, shifting between substitution, considering ratios, operator theory, and finally inner products.

2. Operator Theory Understanding - The solver demonstrates advanced knowledge of integral operators, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions, reframing the problem in terms of operator theory concepts.

3. Functional Analysis Techniques - The solver successfully applies techniques from functional analysis, particularly working with function spaces, inner products, and integral transformations.

4. Mathematical Contradiction - The solver effectively uses proof by contradiction to establish that the difference function must be zero, by showing that any non-zero difference would lead to a logical impossibility.

5. Strategic Planning - Throughout the solution process, the solver demonstrates the ability to formulate different approaches and evaluate their potential for solving the problem.
