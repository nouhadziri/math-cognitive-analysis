Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks about the properties of conics passing through four specific points: the vertices of a triangle $OAB$ and its centroid $G$. We need to prove that all such conics are hyperbolas and find the locus of their centers.

Let the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle be $O=(0,0)$, $A=(x_A, y_A)$, $B=(x_B, y_B)$.
The coordinates of the centroid $G$ are given by $G = \left(\frac{0+x_A+x_B}{3}, \frac{0+y_A+y_B}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{x_A+x_B}{3}, \frac{y_A+y_B}{3}\right)$.

The general equation of a conic section is $ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$.
Since the conic passes through the origin $O=(0,0)$, we have $c=0$.
The equation becomes $ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 + 2gx + 2fy = 0$.

The conic passes through $A=(x_A, y_A)$:
$ax_A^2 + 2hx_A y_A + by_A^2 + 2gx_A + 2fy_A = 0 \quad (*)$

The conic passes through $B=(x_B, y_B)$:
$ax_B^2 + 2hx_B y_B + by_B^2 + 2gx_B + 2fy_B = 0 \quad (**)$

The conic passes through $G=\left(\frac{x_A+x_B}{3}, \frac{y_A+y_B}{3}\right)$:
$a\left(\frac{x_A+x_B}{3}\right)^2 + 2h\left(\frac{x_A+x_B}{3}\right)\left(\frac{y_A+y_B}{3}\right) + b\left(\frac{y_A+y_B}{3}\right)^2 + 2g\left(\frac{x_A+x_B}{3}\right) + 2f\left(\frac{y_A+y_B}{3}\right) = 0$
Multiplying by 9:
$a(x_A+x_B)^2 + 2h(x_A+x_B)(y_A+y_B) + b(y_A+y_B)^2 + 6g(x_A+x_B) + 6f(y_A+y_B) = 0 \quad (***)$

Expanding the terms in $(***)$:
$a(x_A^2 + 2x_Ax_B + x_B^2) + 2h(x_Ay_A + x_Ay_B + x_By_A + x_By_B) + b(y_A^2 + 2y_Ay_B + y_B^2) + 6g(x_A+x_B) + 6f(y_A+y_B) = 0$
$ax_A^2 + 2ax_Ax_B + ax_B^2 + 2hx_Ay_A + 2hx_Ay_B + 2hx_By_A + 2hx_By_B + by_A^2 + 2by_Ay_B + by_B^2 + 6gx_A + 6gx_B + 6fy_A + 6fy_B = 0$

Consider the equation of a degenerate conic consisting of two lines passing through the origin.
Case 1: Lines $OA$ and $OB$.
The equation is of the form $(l_1 x + m_1 y)(l_2 x + m_2 y) = 0$.
Equation of line $OA$: $y_A x - x_A y = 0$.
Equation of line $OB$: $y_B x - x_B y = 0$.
Conic equation: $(y_A x - x_A y)(y_B x - x_B y) = 0$
$y_A y_B x^2 - y_A x_B xy - x_A y_B xy + x_A x_B y^2 = 0$
$y_A y_B x^2 - (y_A x_B + x_A y_B) xy + x_A x_B y^2 = 0$
This conic passes through $O, A, B$. Let's check if it passes through $G$.
Substitute $G = \left(\frac{x_A+x_B}{3}, \frac{y_A+y_B}{3}\right)$:
$y_A y_B \left(\frac{x_A+x_B}{3}\right)^2 - (y_A x_B + x_A y_B) \left(\frac{x_A+x_B}{3}\right)\left(\frac{y_A+y_B}{3}\right) + x_A x_B \left(\frac{y_A+y_B}{3}\right)^2 = 0$
Multiply by 9:
$y_A y_B (x_A+x_B)^2 - (y_A x_B + x_A y_B) (x_A+x_B)(y_A+y_B) + x_A x_B (y_A+y_B)^2 = 0$

Let's consider the determinant $\Delta = h^2 - ab$ for the conic $ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$.
The type of conic is determined by $\Delta$:
$\Delta > 0$: hyperbola
$\Delta = 0$: parabola
$\Delta < 0$: ellipse

Consider the family of conics passing through four given points.
If no three of the points are collinear, then the family of conics can be represented by a linear combination of two degenerate conics passing through these four points.

The points are $O, A, B, G$.
Degenerate conic 1: lines $OA$ and $BG$.
Line $OA$: $y_A x - x_A y = 0$.
Line $BG$ passing through $B=(x_B, y_B)$ and $G=\left(\frac{x_A+x_B}{3}, \frac{y_A+y_B}{3}\right)$.
Slope of $BG = \frac{\frac{y_A+y_B}{3} - y_B}{\frac{x_A+x_B}{3} - x_B} = \frac{y_A+y_B-3y_B}{x_A+x_B-3x_B} = \frac{y_A-2y_B}{x_A-2x_B}$.
Equation of line $BG$: $y - y_B = \frac{y_A-2y_B}{x_A-2x_B} (x - x_B)$
$(y - y_B)(x_A-2x_B) = (y_A-2y_B)(x - x_B)$
$y(x_A-2x_B) - y_B(x_A-2x_B) = x(y_A-2y_B) - x_B(y_A-2y_B)$
$y(x_A-2x_B) - x(y_A-2y_B) - y_B x_A + 2y_B x_B + x_B y_A - 2x_B y_B = 0$
$y(x_A-2x_B) - x(y_A-2y_B) - y_B x_A + x_B y_A = 0$
$y(x_A-2x_B) - x(y_A-2y_B) + x_B y_A - y_B x_A = 0$
$y(x_A-2x_B) - x(y_A-2y_B) - (y_B x_A - x_B y_A) = 0$

Degenerate conic 2: lines $OB$ and $AG$.
Line $OB$: $y_B x - x_B y = 0$.
Line $AG$ passing through $A=(x_A, y_A)$ and $G=\left(\frac{x_A+x_B}{3}, \frac{y_A+y_B}{3}\right)$.
Slope of $AG = \frac{\frac{y_A+y_B}{3} - y_A}{\frac{x_A+x_B}{3} - x_A} = \frac{y_A+y_B-3y_A}{x_A+x_B-3x_A} = \frac{y_B-2y_A}{x_B-2x_A}$.
Equation of line $AG$: $y - y_A = \frac{y_B-2y_A}{x_B-2x_A} (x - x_A)$
$(y - y_A)(x_B-2x_A) = (y_B-2y_A)(x - x_A)$
$y(x_B-2x_A) - y_A(x_B-2x_A) = x(y_B-2y_A) - x_A(y_B-2y_A)$
$y(x_B-2x_A) - x(y_B-2y_A) - y_A x_B + 2y_A x_A + x_A y_B - 2x_A y_A = 0$
$y(x_B-2x_A) - x(y_B-2y_A) - y_A x_B + x_A y_B = 0$
$y(x_B-2x_A) - x(y_B-2y_A) + (x_A y_B - y_A x_B) = 0$

The family of conics passing through $O, A, B, G$ is given by:
$\lambda (y_A x - x_A y) [y(x_A-2x_B) - x(y_A-2y_B) - (y_B x_A - x_B y_A)] + \mu (y_B x - x_B y) [y(x_B-2x_A) - x(y_B-2y_A) + (x_A y_B - y_A x_B)] = 0$

Let's simplify the terms inside the brackets.
Term 1: $y(x_A-2x_B) - x(y_A-2y_B) - (y_B x_A - x_B y_A)$
Term 2: $y(x_B-2x_A) - x(y_B-2y_A) + (x_A y_B - y_A x_B)$

The equation of the conic is of the form $S_1 + k S_2 = 0$, where $S_1=0$ is the degenerate conic through the four points, and $S_2=0$ is another.

Consider the case where the conic is a pair of lines.
Possible pairs of lines passing through the four points:
1. $OA, BG$
2. $OB, AG$
3. $OG, AB$

Equation of line $AB$: $y - y_A = \frac{y_B-y_A}{x_B-x_A} (x - x_A)$
$(y - y_A)(x_B-x_A) = (y_B-y_A)(x - x_A)$
$y(x_B-x_A) - y_A(x_B-x_A) = x(y_B-y_A) - x_A(y_B-y_A)$
$y(x_B-x_A) - x(y_B-y_A) - y_A x_B + y_A x_A + x_A y_B - x_A y_A = 0$
$y(x_B-x_A) - x(y_B-y_A) - y_A x_B + x_A y_B = 0$
$y(x_B-x_A) - x(y_B-y_A) + (x_A y_B - y_A x_B) = 0$

Equation of line $OG$:
Slope of $OG = \frac{\frac{y_A+y_B}{3}}{\frac{x_A+x_B}{3}} = \frac{y_A+y_B}{x_A+x_B}$.
Equation: $y = \frac{y_A+y_B}{x_A+x_B} x \implies y(x_A+x_B) - x(y_A+y_B) = 0$.

Degenerate conic 3: $(y(x_A+x_B) - x(y_A+y_B)) [y(x_B-x_A) - x(y_B-y_A) + (x_A y_B - y_A x_B)] = 0$.

The equation of any conic passing through $O, A, B, G$ can be written as:
$L_{OA} L_{BG} + k L_{OB} L_{AG} = 0$

Consider the coefficients of $x^2$, $xy$, $y^2$ in the equation of the conic.
From the form $ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 + ... = 0$.
The terms with $x^2, xy, y^2$ come from the product of the linear terms.

From $L_{OA} L_{BG}$:
$L_{OA} = y_A x - x_A y$
$L_{BG} = y(x_A-2x_B) - x(y_A-2y_B) - (y_B x_A - x_B y_A)$
Coefficient of $x^2$: $y_A \cdot (-(y_A-2y_B)) = -y_A^2 + 2y_A y_B$
Coefficient of $xy$: $y_A (x_A-2x_B) + (-x_A) (-(y_A-2y_B)) = y_A x_A - 2y_A x_B + x_A y_A - 2x_A y_B = 2x_A y_A - 2y_A x_B - 2x_A y_B$
Coefficient of $y^2$: $(-x_A) \cdot (x_A-2x_B) = -x_A^2 + 2x_A x_B$

From $L_{OB} L_{AG}$:
$L_{OB} = y_B x - x_B y$
$L_{AG} = y(x_B-2x_A) - x(y_B-2y_A) + (x_A y_B - y_A x_B)$
Coefficient of $x^2$: $y_B \cdot (-(y_B-2y_A)) = -y_B^2 + 2y_A y_B$
Coefficient of $xy$: $y_B (x_B-2x_A) + (-x_B) (-(y_B-2y_A)) = y_B x_B - 2y_B x_A + x_B y_B - 2x_B y_A = 2x_B y_B - 2y_B x_A - 2x_B y_A$
Coefficient of $y^2$: $(-x_B) \cdot (x_B-2x_A) = -x_B^2 + 2x_A x_B$

The coefficients of $x^2, xy, y^2$ in the conic equation are:
$a = \lambda (-y_A^2 + 2y_A y_B) + k \mu (-y_B^2 + 2y_A y_B)$
$2h = \lambda (2x_A y_A - 2y_A x_B - 2x_A y_B) + k \mu (2x_B y_B - 2y_B x_A - 2x_B y_A)$
$b = \lambda (-x_A^2 + 2x_A x_B) + k \mu (-x_B^2 + 2x_A x_B)$

We need to find the sign of $\Delta = h^2 - ab$.

Consider a simpler approach using projective geometry.
The locus of conics through four points is a pencil of conics.
The degenerate conics in this pencil are the pairs of lines connecting the four points.
Pairs of lines: $OA \cdot BG$, $OB \cdot AG$, $OG \cdot AB$.

The equation of the pencil can be written as:
$S_1 + \lambda S_2 = 0$, where $S_1=0$ and $S_2=0$ are two conics in the pencil.
We can choose the degenerate conics:
$L_{OA} L_{BG} + \lambda L_{OB} L_{AG} = 0$

Consider the determinant of the quadratic terms:
$\begin{vmatrix} a & h \\ h & b \end{vmatrix} = ab - h^2 = -\Delta$.
The sign of $\Delta$ determines the type of conic.

Consider a transformation such that $O=(0,0)$, $A=(1,0)$, $B=(0,1)$.
Then $G = \left(\frac{1+0}{3}, \frac{0+1}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}\right)$.

Equation of conic passing through $(0,0)$: $ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 + 2gx + 2fy = 0$.
Passes through $A=(1,0)$: $a + 2g = 0 \implies g = -a/2$.
Passes through $B=(0,1)$: $b + 2f = 0 \implies f = -b/2$.
Equation becomes $ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 - ax - by = 0$.

Passes through $G=(1/3, 1/3)$:
$a(1/9) + 2h(1/9) + b(1/9) - a(1/3) - b(1/3) = 0$
$a + 2h + b - 3a - 3b = 0$
$2h - 2a - 2b = 0$
$h = a + b$.

The equation of the conic is $ax^2 + 2(a+b)xy + by^2 - ax - by = 0$.
The determinant of the quadratic terms is:
$\Delta = h^2 - ab = (a+b)^2 - ab = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - ab = a^2 + ab + b^2$.
Since $a^2 \ge 0$, $b^2 \ge 0$, $ab$ can be positive, negative or zero.
If $a$ and $b$ are not both zero, then $a^2 + ab + b^2 > 0$, since it can be written as $(a + b/2)^2 + 3b^2/4$.
If $b=0$, then $a^2 > 0$. If $a=0$, then $b^2 > 0$.
If $a, b \ne 0$. If $ab > 0$, $a^2+ab+b^2 > 0$. If $ab < 0$, let $b = -kc$, $a=c$.
$c^2 - kc^2 + k^2 c^2 = c^2(1-k+k^2)$.
Consider the quadratic $1-k+k^2$. Discriminant $= (-1)^2 - 4(1)(1) = 1 - 4 = -3 < 0$.
Since the coefficient of $k^2$ is positive, $1-k+k^2 > 0$.
So, $\Delta = a^2 + ab + b^2 > 0$, which implies the conic is a hyperbola.

Part (b): Find the locus of the centers of these hyperbolas.
The center of the conic $ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$ is given by the intersection of:
$ax + hy + g = 0$
$hx + by + f = 0$

For our family of conics, $g = -a/2$, $f = -b/2$, $h = a+b$.
$ax + (a+b)y - a/2 = 0 \implies 2ax + 2(a+b)y - a = 0 \quad (1)$
$(a+b)x + by - b/2 = 0 \implies 2(a+b)x + 2by - b = 0 \quad (2)$

Multiply (1) by $b$ and (2) by $-(a+b)$:
$2abx + 2b(a+b)y - ab = 0$
$-2(a+b)^2 x - 2b(a+b)y + b(a+b) = 0$

Adding these two equations:
$(2ab - 2(a+b)^2) x - ab + b(a+b) = 0$
$(2ab - 2(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)) x - ab + ab + b^2 = 0$
$(2ab - 2a^2 - 4ab - 2b^2) x + b^2 = 0$
$(-2a^2 - 2ab - 2b^2) x + b^2 = 0$
$x = \frac{-b^2}{-2(a^2 + ab + b^2)} = \frac{b^2}{2(a^2 + ab + b^2)}$

Multiply (1) by $-(a+b)$ and (2) by $a$:
$-2a(a+b)x - 2(a+b)^2 y + a(a+b) = 0$
$2a(a+b)x + 2aby - ab = 0$

Adding these two equations:
$(-2(a+b)^2 + 2ab) y + a(a+b) - ab = 0$
$(-2(a^2 + 2ab + b^2) + 2ab) y + a^2 + ab - ab = 0$
$(-2a^2 - 4ab - 2b^2 + 2ab) y + a^2 = 0$
$(-2a^2 - 2ab - 2b^2) y + a^2 = 0$
$y = \frac{-a^2}{-2(a^2 + ab + b^2)} = \frac{a^2}{2(a^2 + ab + b^2)}$

Locus of centers $(x, y)$:
$x = \frac{b^2}{2(a^2 + ab + b^2)}$, $y = \frac{a^2}{2(a^2 + ab + b^2)}$
$\frac{y}{x} = \frac{a^2}{b^2} \implies b^2 y = a^2 x$.

$2(a^2 + ab + b^2) x = b^2$
$2a^2 x + 2abx + 2b^2 x = b^2$
Substitute $a^2 = \frac{b^2 y}{x}$:
$2 \frac{b^2 y}{x} x + 2 b \sqrt{\frac{b^2 y}{x}} x + 2 b^2 x = b^2$
$2 b^2 y + 2 b^2 \sqrt{\frac{y}{x}} x + 2 b^2 x = b^2$
Divide by $b^2$ (assuming $b \ne 0$):
$2y + 2 \sqrt{xy} + 2x = 1$
$2x + 2y + 2\sqrt{xy} = 1$
$(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y})^2 = 1/2$
$\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

If $b=0$, then $h=a$, $f=0$.
$ax + ay - a/2 = 0 \implies x+y = 1/2$.
$ax = 0 \implies x = 0$. Center is $(0, 1/2)$.
If $a=0$, then $h=b$, $g=0$.
$by - b/2 = 0 \implies y = 1/2$.
$bx = 0 \implies x = 0$. Center is $(1/2, 0)$.

The locus of the centers is the arc of the ellipse $\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ in the first quadrant.

<text>$c^2 - kc^2 + k^2 c^2 = c^2(1-k+k^2)$.
Consider the quadratic $1-k+k^2$. Discriminant $= (-1)^2 - 4(1)(1) = 1 - 4 = -3 < 0$.
Since the coefficient of $k^2$ is positive, $1-k+k^2 > 0$.
So, $\Delta = a^2 + ab + b^2 > 0$, which implies the conic is a hyperbola.</text>
<explanation>The solver constructs a proof that the discriminant is always positive by analyzing the quadratic expression 1-k+k^2. They show that this expression is always positive by examining its discriminant, thus proving that the conics must be hyperbolas. This demonstrates the ability to construct a complete mathematical proof.</explanation>

<skill>Parametric Representation</skill>
<definition>The ability to represent a family of mathematical objects using parameters, and to derive properties of the family by analyzing how these parameters relate to each other.</definition>

<text>Locus of centers $(x, y)$:
$x = \frac{b^2}{2(a^2 + ab + b^2)}$, $y = \frac{a^2}{2(a^2 + ab + b^2)}$
$\frac{y}{x} = \frac{a^2}{b^2} \implies b^2 y = a^2 x$.</text>
<explanation>The solver derives parametric expressions for the coordinates of the centers of the hyperbolas in terms of the parameters a and b. They then establish relationships between these parameters and the coordinates to determine the locus, showing advanced understanding of parametric representations.</explanation>

<text>$2x + 2y + 2\sqrt{xy} = 1$
$(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y})^2 = 1/2$
$\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver manipulates the parametric equations to eliminate the parameters and derive a direct relationship between x and y coordinates. This final equation represents the locus of centers as an elliptical curve, demonstrating the ability to convert from a parametric to a direct representation.</explanation>

<skill>Case Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to break down a problem into distinct cases or scenarios and analyze each separately to build a comprehensive solution.</definition>

<text>If $b=0$, then $h=a$, $f=0$.
$ax + ay - a/2 = 0 \implies x+y = 1/2$.
$ax = 0 \implies x = 0$. Center is $(0, 1/2)$.
If $a=0$, then $h=b$, $g=0$.
$by - b/2 = 0 \implies y = 1/2$.
$bx = 0 \implies x = 0$. Center is $(1/2, 0)$.</text>
<explanation>The solver separately analyzes the special cases where a=0 or b=0, which were not covered in the general analysis. This demonstrates thorough case analysis to ensure all possibilities are considered, leading to the identification of additional points on the locus.</explanation>

<text>Line $BG$ passing through $B=(x_B, y_B)$ and $G=\left(\frac{x_A+x_B}{3}, \frac{y_A+y_B}{3}\right)$.
Slope of $BG = \frac{\frac{y_A+y_B}{3} - y_B}{\frac{x_A+x_B}{3} - x_B} = \frac{y_A+y_B-3y_B}{x_A+x_B-3x_B} = \frac{y_A-2y_B}{x_A-2x_B}$.
Equation of line $BG$: $y - y_B = \frac{y_A-2y_B}{x_A-2x_B} (x - x_B)$</text>
<explanation>The solver derives the equation of the line BG by first calculating its slope using the coordinates of points B and G, then applying the point-slope form of the line equation. This demonstrates the ability to derive line equations from geometric information.</explanation>

<start>2847</start>
<end>3174</end>
<text>Line $AG$ passing through $A=(x_A, y_A)$ and $G=\left(\frac{x_A+x_B}{3}, \frac{y_A+y_B}{3}\right)$.
Slope of $AG = \frac{\frac{y_A+y_B}{3} - y_A}{\frac{x_A+x_B}{3} - x_A} = \frac{y_A+y_B-3y_A}{x_A+x_B-3x_A} = \frac{y_B-2y_A}{x_B-2x_A}$.
Equation of line $AG$: $y - y_A = \frac{y_B-2y_A}{x_B-2x_A} (x - x_A)$</text>
<explanation>Similarly, the solver derives the equation of line AG using the same approach. This further demonstrates their ability to derive line equations systematically for multiple lines in the problem.</explanation>
