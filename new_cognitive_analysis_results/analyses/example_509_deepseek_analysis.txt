Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to find the radius of a sphere that passes through all five vertices of a right square pyramid. The pyramid has a base with side length 6 and a volume of 54. All five vertices lie on the sphere, which has a radius of m/n where m and n are coprime. Then I need to find m + n. Alright, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, let me recall what a right square pyramid is. It's a pyramid with a square base and the apex (the top vertex) is directly above the center of the base. So the apex is along the line perpendicular to the base passing through the center. The volume of a pyramid is given by (1/3) * base area * height. Since we know the volume and the base side length, we can find the height of the pyramid.

Given the base side length is 6, so the base area is 6*6 = 36. Volume is 54, so plug into the formula:

54 = (1/3) * 36 * height
=> 54 = 12 * height
=> height = 54 / 12 = 9/2 = 4.5

So the height of the pyramid is 9/2. That means the apex is 9/2 units above the base. Now, since all five vertices lie on a sphere, we need to find the radius of this sphere.

To do that, I should model this pyramid in coordinate system. Let me place the base of the pyramid on the xy-plane, centered at the origin. So the base vertices would be at (3, 3, 0), (3, -3, 0), (-3, -3, 0), (-3, 3, 0). Wait, actually since it's a square with side length 6, each side is 6 units, so from the center (origin) each half-side is 3 units. So the four base vertices would be at (3, 3, 0), (3, -3, 0), (-3, -3, 0), (-3, 3, 0). Wait, is that right? Hmm, actually no. If the base is a square with side length 6, then each edge of the square is 6 units. If we center it at the origin, then the coordinates of the four corners would be (3, 3, 0), (3, -3, 0), (-3, -3, 0), (-3, 3, 0), but no, wait. Wait a second—if the side length is 6, then each side goes from -3 to +3 along the x and y axes. For example, the four base vertices should be (3, 3, 0), (3, -3, 0), (-3, -3, 0), (-3, 3, 0). Wait, but actually, when the square is centered at the origin with side length 6, the coordinates along the x and y axes would be (±3, ±3, 0). Wait, that's actually incorrect. Because the distance between (3, 3, 0) and (3, -3, 0) is 6 units, but that's diagonal, not the side length. Oops, I made a mistake here. 

Right, the confusion is between side length and coordinates. If the square base has side length 6, then the distance between adjacent vertices should be 6. So for example, if the base is centered at the origin, the coordinates should be (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (-3, 0, 0), and (0, -3, 0). Wait, no, that's a square with vertices on the axes, but the side length would be the distance between (3,0,0) and (0,3,0), which is sqrt((3)^2 + (3)^2) = 3√2 ≈ 4.24, which is not 6. So that's not right. 

Let me think. Maybe it's better to align the sides with the axes. So that the square is axis-aligned. Then the coordinates of the four base vertices would be (3, 3, 0), (3, -3, 0), (-3, -3, 0), and (-3, 3, 0). Then the distance between (3,3,0) and (3,-3,0) is 6, which is the side length. Wait, but no. Wait, distance between (3,3,0) and (3,-3,0) is sqrt(0^2 + (-6)^2 + 0^2) = 6. Wait, but those are opposite vertices, so that's actually the diagonal of the square, not the side. Because in a square, the diagonal is s√2 where s is the side length. So if the diagonal is 6, then the side length would be 6/√2 = 3√2. But we have here that the side length is 6, so that approach is wrong.

Hold on, I need to correctly determine the coordinates of the square base with side length 6. If the base is a square centered at the origin, with sides aligned along the x and y axes, then the distance from the center to each side is 3 (since the side length is 6, half is 3). So each vertex would be at (3,3,0), (3,-3,0), (-3,-3,0), (-3,3,0). But wait, the distance between (3,3,0) and (3,-3,0) is 6, which would not be the edge length. Let me compute the distance between (3,3,0) and (-3,3,0); no, that's 6 units. Wait, actually, let me see. If the square is axis-aligned with side length 6, then each side extends from -3 to +3 along either the x or y axis. Then the four corners would indeed be at (±3, ±3, 0). However, wait, when I do that, the edges between them would be the sides of the square. Let's check the distance between (3,3,0) and (3,-3,0). It's sqrt[(3-3)^2 + (-3-3)^2 + (0-0)^2] = sqrt[0 + 36 + 0] = 6. So the edge between (3,3,0) and (3,-3,0) is length 6, but in reality, those two points are actually on a vertical line if plotted, but in the square, edges are supposed to connect adjacent vertices. Wait, no, if the square is axis-aligned, a square aligned with the axes would have edges of length 6 between (3,3,0) and (3,-3,0), but that is actually a vertical edge. However, in reality, that's incorrect. 

Wait, wait, no—confusion is arising here. Let me take a step back.

In a standard square with side length 6, centered at the origin, aligned with the axes. The correct coordinates would be: if you move along the x-axis, each side from center to vertex is 3 along the x and 0 along the y. Wait, that would not be a square.

Wait no, actually. When the square is axis-aligned, each side is parallel to the x or y axis. So the four corners would be (a, a), (-a, a), (-a, -a), (a, -a) for some a. The distance between (a, a) and (-a, a) is 2a. Wait, no, that's the length of the side along the x-axis? Wait, no. If a square is axis-aligned, then each vertex will be (a, b) such that the sides are parallel. Wait, it might be better to have the square with side length 6. So between each adjacent vertex along the x-axis, the distance would be 6. Let me correct. Let's align the square such that two sides are along the x and y axes. Then the four vertices would be (0,0), (6,0), (6,6), (0,6). But then center is at (3,3). But in the problem, the pyramid is a right pyramid, so centered at the origin. Wait, perhaps this is getting too confusing. 

Alternative approach: Let's set up coordinates for the base. Since it's a right pyramid, apex is straight above the center of the base. Let’s position the base on the xy-plane with center at (0,0,0). The base is a square with side length 6, so the distance from the center to any base vertex is half the diagonal of the square. The diagonal of the square with side length s is s√2, so half-diagonal is (s√2)/2. Therefore, for s = 6: half-diagonal = (6√2)/2 = 3√2. So the coordinates of the four base vertices are (3√2, 0, 0), (0, 3√2, 0), (-3√2, 0, 0), (0, -3√2, 0). Wait, but in this case, the distance from center to vertex is 3√2, which is correct because half the diagonal is that. But then the edges would be of length between those points. For example, the distance between (3√2, 0, 0) and (0, 3√2, 0) is sqrt[(3√2)^2 + (-3√2)^2] = sqrt[18 + 18] = sqrt[36] = 6, which is the edge length. Wait, but in reality, that's the distance between two adjacent vertices? Wait no, in a square, the adjacent vertices are connected by edges of length s, which is 6. But here, when arranging vertices like (3√2, 0,0), etc., then the edges between those vertices are of length 6. Therefore, actually, this setup is correct: The base square with side length 6 can be inscribed in a circle of radius 3√2 (distance from center to vertex).

But where are the coordinates? For example, if the base is centered at the origin with vertices on the x and y axes, then the coordinates would indeed be (3√2,0,0), (0,3√2,0), etc., but no—wait, hang on. Wait, when placed with vertices along the axes, the square is rotated 45 degrees relative to the coordinate axes. So in that case, the four vertices are at (a, 0), (0, a), (-a, 0), (0, -a), and the side length would be the distance between (a,0) and (0,a), which is sqrt(a^2 + a^2) = a√2. To get side length 6, that distance needs to be 6, so a√2 = 6 => a = 6/√2 = 3√2. Therefore, the coordinates are (3√2, 0, 0), (0, 3√2, 0), (-3√2, 0, 0), (0, -3√2, 0). Therefore, the base vertices are arranged like this when rotated, so the edges between them are indeed 6 units.

However, perhaps the problem says the base is a square with side length 6, and it's a right pyramid, so maybe the coordinates are axis-aligned? That is, sides are parallel to the axes. In this case, the coordinates would be (3,3,0), (3,-3,0), (-3,-3,0), (-3,3,0). Now, wait, let's check the edge length here. Distance between (3,3,0) and (3,-3,0) is 6 units, which would be the edges. But (3,3,0) to (3,-3,0) is along the y-axis, but in a square, adjacent vertices should be connected by edges, so those points would not be adjacent. If the square is axis-aligned, adjacent vertices would be (3,3) to (3,-3), but that's only true if the sides are vertical lines. Wait, no—usually, a square has adjacent vertices connected by edges of the same length, so perhaps there is confusion in coordinates here.

Wait, perhaps the answer lies in how we model the square. Let me get this correct once and for all. If the base is a square with side length 6, centered at the origin, and with sides parallel to the x and y axes. So then, the base extends from -3 to +3 in both x and y directions. So the four vertices would be at (3,3,0), (3,-3,0), (-3,-3,0), (-3,3,0). Then the edges between these vertices: For example, the edge between (3,3,0) and (3,-3,0) has length sqrt(0 + (-6)^2 + 0) = 6, and the edge between (3,3,0) and (-3,3,0) also has length 6. Wait, but in a square all edges should be equal, but in this case, those edges are along the x and y axes. Therefore, each side of the square is of length 6, meaning that from (3,3,0) to (3,-3,0) is length 6, but then the square is actually a rectangle? Wait, no, a square must have all edges equal. Wait, but in this configuration, from (3,3,0) to (3,-3,0) is 6 units, (3,3,0) to (-3,3,0) is also 6 units, so actually it is a square. Wait, but in reality, in this coordinate system, the square is being represented as having sides aligned with the axes. The distance from (3,3,0) to (3,-3,0) is indeed 6 units in the y-direction, and the same in the x-direction. However, the distance between (3,3,0) and (-3, -3,0) would be sqrt(6^2 + 6^2) = 6√2, which is the diagonal. Thus, in this setup, the square with vertices at (±3, ±3, 0) would indeed have sides of length 6, with sides aligned along the x and y axes, and diagonals of length 6√2. But that requires that the x and y lengths are each 6 units. Wait, actually, let me compute the distance between adjacent vertices here. So (3,3,0) to (3,-3,0) is 6 units, as we said. But (3,3,0) to (-3,3,0) is also 6 units. So in this case, each edge is 6 units. So that works. Wait, but then each edge is aligned along the x or y axis. So yes, that is actually correct. Therefore, these coordinates are valid for a square of side length 6, centered at the origin, with sides aligned with the coordinate axes.

Therefore, the four base vertices are (3,3,0), (3,-3,0), (-3,-3,0), (-3,3,0). Then the apex is directly above the center (0,0,0) at (0,0,h). We found h = 9/2 earlier. So apex is at (0, 0, 9/2).

Now, we need to find the radius of the sphere passing through all five vertices. Let me recall that the sphere's equation is (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2 = R^2. Since all five vertices lie on the sphere, we can set up equations using these coordinates. But I need to find a, b, c, and R such that all five points satisfy the equation.

But intuitively, because the pyramid is symmetric with respect to the z-axis (since it's a right pyramid), the center of the sphere should be along the z-axis. Because any non-symmetrical position would break the symmetry, and since all base vertices are symmetric around the z-axis, the center must lie on the z-axis. So, the center of the sphere is at (0, 0, k) for some k, and the radius is R.

Therefore, the equation of the sphere is x^2 + y^2 + (z - k)^2 = R^2.

Now, substituting the coordinates of the base vertices and the apex into this equation.

Let's take one of the base vertices, say, (3, 3, 0). Substituting into the sphere equation:

3^2 + 3^2 + (0 - k)^2 = R^2.

Similarly, take the apex (0, 0, 9/2):

0^2 + 0^2 + (9/2 - k)^2 = R^2.

Thus, we have two equations:

From base vertex: 9 + 9 + k^2 = R^2 => 18 + k^2 = R^2.

From apex: (81/4) - 9k + k^2 = R^2.

Therefore, set them equal:

18 + k^2 = (81/4) - 9k + k^2

Subtract k^2 from both sides:

18 = 81/4 - 9k

Then subtract 81/4 from both sides:

18 - 81/4 = -9k

Convert 18 to 72/4:

72/4 - 81/4 = -9k => (-9/4) = -9k

Divide both sides by -9:

( -9/4 ) / (-9 ) = k => (1/4) = k.

So k = 1/4. Therefore, the center of the sphere is at (0, 0, 1/4). Then R^2 = 18 + k^2 = 18 + (1/16) = (288/16) + (1/16) = 289/16. Therefore, R = 17/4.

Wait, so radius is 17/4, so 17 + 4 = 21, so m + n is 21. Is this correct?

Wait, but let's verify with another point to be sure.

Take another base vertex, say, (3, -3, 0). Substitute into sphere equation:

3^2 + (-3)^2 + (0 - 1/4)^2 = R^2

Same as 9 + 9 + (1/16) = 18 + 1/16 = 289/16, which is 17^2 / 4^2, so R = 17/4. Similarly, apex at (0,0,9/2):

(9/2 - 1/4)^2 = ( (18/4 - 1/4 ) )^2 = (17/4)^2. Which gives R = 17/4. Therefore, correct.

Therefore, the radius is 17/4, so m = 17, n = 4, which are coprime. Hence m + n = 21.

But wait, the problem says "the five vertices of the pyramid all lie on a sphere with radius m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers". Then m = 17 and n =4, so answer is 21. Hmm, seems straightforward. But I should check for other base points as well, just in case.

Take another base point, (-3, -3, 0):

(-3)^2 + (-3)^2 + (0 - 1/4)^2 = 9 + 9 + 1/16 = 18 + 1/16 = 289/16, same as R^2. So that's good.

Another base vertex? ( -3,3,0): same as before, so it's okay.

Wait, but is this the only sphere passing through those points? Since the problem states all five vertices lie on a sphere, so this is the unique sphere passing through them due to the symmetry. Therefore, if all equations check out, then the answer is 17/4, which gives 21. 

Therefore, the answer is 21.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{21}

<text>Wait, but is this the only sphere passing through those points? Since the problem states all five vertices lie on a sphere, so this is the unique sphere passing through them due to the symmetry. Therefore, if all equations check out, then the answer is 17/4, which gives 21. 

Therefore, the answer is 21.</text>
<explanation>The solver engages in metacognitive regulation by evaluating whether their solution is unique and complete before finalizing their answer, showing awareness of the need to fully address all aspects of the problem.</explanation>
