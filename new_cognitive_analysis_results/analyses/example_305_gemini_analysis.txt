Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the value of $a+b$, where $AP = \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}$, given a geometric setup involving a square and circumcenters of certain triangles.

Let the vertices of the square be $A=(0,12)$, $B=(12,12)$, $C=(12,0)$, $D=(0,0)$.
The diagonal $AC$ lies on the line $y = 12 - x$.
Let $P$ be a point on $AC$. Since $AP > CP$, $P$ is closer to $A$ than to $C$.
The coordinates of a point on $AC$ can be parameterized. Let $P = (x, 12-x)$.
Since $P$ is on $AC$, we have $0 \le x \le 12$.
The midpoint of $AC$ is $(\frac{0+12}{2}, \frac{12+0}{2}) = (6, 6)$.
For $AP > CP$, $P$ must lie on the segment from $A$ to the midpoint of $AC$.
The distance from $A=(0,12)$ to $P=(x, 12-x)$ is $\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (12-x-12)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (-x)^2} = \sqrt{2x^2} = |x|\sqrt{2}$. Since $x \ge 0$, $AP = x\sqrt{2}$.
The distance from $C=(12,0)$ to $P=(x, 12-x)$ is $\sqrt{(x-12)^2 + (12-x-0)^2} = \sqrt{(x-12)^2 + (12-x)^2} = \sqrt{2(x-12)^2} = |x-12|\sqrt{2}$. Since $x \le 12$, $CP = (12-x)\sqrt{2}$.
The condition $AP > CP$ implies $x\sqrt{2} > (12-x)\sqrt{2}$, so $x > 12-x$, which gives $2x > 12$, $x > 6$.
So, the $x$-coordinate of $P$ is in the interval $(6, 12]$.

Now, let's consider the circumcenters $O_1$ and $O_2$.
$O_1$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle ABP$.
$O_2$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle CDP$.

Consider $\triangle ABP$. The vertices are $A=(0,12)$, $B=(12,12)$, $P=(x, 12-x)$.
Consider $\triangle CDP$. The vertices are $C=(12,0)$, $D=(0,0)$, $P=(x, 12-x)$.

Let the side length of the square be $s = 12$.

Alternative approach without coordinates:
Let the origin be at $A$. Then $A=(0,0)$, $B=(12,0)$, $C=(12,12)$, $D=(0,12)$.
The diagonal $AC$ has the equation $y=x$.
Let $P$ be a point on $AC$. Then $P=(p,p)$.
The condition $AP > CP$ means $P$ is closer to $A$. The midpoint of $AC$ is $(6,6)$.
Since $AP > CP$, $0 \le p < 6$. Mistake here, the coordinate system changed. Let's stick to the first one.

Let's use vectors.
Origin at $A$. $A=(0,0)$, $B=(12,0)$, $C=(12,12)$, $D=(0,12)$.
Diagonal $AC$ has equation $y=x$. $P=(p,p)$.
Midpoint of $AC = (6,6)$.
$AP = \sqrt{p^2+p^2} = p\sqrt{2}$.
$CP = \sqrt{(12-p)^2 + (12-p)^2} = (12-p)\sqrt{2}$.
$AP > CP \implies p\sqrt{2} > (12-p)\sqrt{2} \implies p > 12-p \implies 2p > 12 \implies p > 6$.
So, $6 < p \le 12$.

Let's go back to the original coordinate system: $A=(0,12)$, $B=(12,12)$, $C=(12,0)$, $D=(0,0)$.
$P = (x, 12-x)$, where $6 < x \le 12$.

Circumcenter $O_1$ of $\triangle ABP$:
$A=(0,12)$, $B=(12,12)$, $P=(x, 12-x)$.
The perpendicular bisector of $AB$ is the line $x = \frac{0+12}{2} = 6$.
The circumcenter $O_1$ lies on $x=6$. Let $O_1 = (6, y_1)$.
$O_1A^2 = (6-0)^2 + (y_1-12)^2 = 36 + (y_1-12)^2$.
$O_1B^2 = (6-12)^2 + (y_1-12)^2 = 36 + (y_1-12)^2$.
$O_1P^2 = (6-x)^2 + (y_1-(12-x))^2 = (6-x)^2 + (y_1-12+x)^2$.
$O_1A^2 = O_1P^2 \implies 36 + (y_1-12)^2 = (6-x)^2 + (y_1-12+x)^2$.
$36 + y_1^2 - 24y_1 + 144 = 36 - 12x + x^2 + (y_1-12)^2 + 2x(y_1-12) + x^2$.
$36 + y_1^2 - 24y_1 + 144 = 36 - 12x + x^2 + y_1^2 - 24y_1 + 144 + 2xy_1 - 24x + x^2$.
$0 = -12x + 2x^2 + 2xy_1 - 24x$.
$0 = 2x^2 - 36x + 2xy_1$.
Since $x > 6$, $x \ne 0$. Divide by $2x$:
$0 = x - 18 + y_1$, so $y_1 = 18 - x$.
$O_1 = (6, 18-x)$.

Circumcenter $O_2$ of $\triangle CDP$:
$C=(12,0)$, $D=(0,0)$, $P=(x, 12-x)$.
The perpendicular bisector of $CD$ is the line $x = \frac{12+0}{2} = 6$.
The circumcenter $O_2$ lies on $x=6$. Let $O_2 = (6, y_2)$.
$O_2C^2 = (6-12)^2 + (y_2-0)^2 = 36 + y_2^2$.
$O_2D^2 = (6-0)^2 + (y_2-0)^2 = 36 + y_2^2$.
$O_2P^2 = (6-x)^2 + (y_2-(12-x))^2 = (6-x)^2 + (y_2-12+x)^2$.
$O_2C^2 = O_2P^2 \implies 36 + y_2^2 = (6-x)^2 + (y_2-12+x)^2$.
$36 + y_2^2 = 36 - 12x + x^2 + y_2^2 - 2(12-x)y_2 + (12-x)^2$.
$0 = -12x + x^2 - (24-2x)y_2 + 144 - 24x + x^2$.
$0 = 2x^2 - 36x + 144 - (24-2x)y_2$.
$(24-2x)y_2 = 2x^2 - 36x + 144$.
$2(12-x)y_2 = 2(x^2 - 18x + 72)$.
$(12-x)y_2 = x^2 - 18x + 72$.
$y_2 = \frac{x^2 - 18x + 72}{12-x}$.
$y_2 = \frac{(x-6)(x-12)}{-(x-12)} = -(x-6) = 6-x$.
So, $O_2 = (6, 6-x)$.

We have $O_1 = (6, 18-x)$ and $O_2 = (6, 6-x)$.
Point $P = (x, 12-x)$.

Consider the vectors $\vec{PO_1}$ and $\vec{PO_2}$.
$\vec{PO_1} = (6-x, (18-x)-(12-x)) = (6-x, 18-x-12+x) = (6-x, 6)$.
$\vec{PO_2} = (6-x, (6-x)-(12-x)) = (6-x, 6-x-12+x) = (6-x, -6)$.

The angle between $\vec{PO_1}$ and $\vec{PO_2}$ is $120^{\circ}$.
Using the dot product formula: $\vec{PO_1} \cdot \vec{PO_2} = |\vec{PO_1}| |\vec{PO_2}| \cos(120^{\circ})$.
$\vec{PO_1} \cdot \vec{PO_2} = (6-x)(6-x) + (6)(-6) = (6-x)^2 - 36$.
$|\vec{PO_1}| = \sqrt{(6-x)^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{(6-x)^2 + 36}$.
$|\vec{PO_2}| = \sqrt{(6-x)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{(6-x)^2 + 36}$.
$\cos(120^{\circ}) = -\frac{1}{2}$.

So, $(6-x)^2 - 36 = \sqrt{(6-x)^2 + 36} \cdot \sqrt{(6-x)^2 + 36} \cdot (-\frac{1}{2})$.
$(6-x)^2 - 36 = - \frac{1}{2} ((6-x)^2 + 36)$.
Let $y = (6-x)^2$. Then $y - 36 = -\frac{1}{2} (y + 36)$.
Multiply by 2: $2y - 72 = -y - 36$.
$3y = 72 - 36 = 36$.
$y = 12$.

So, $(6-x)^2 = 12$.
$6-x = \pm \sqrt{12} = \pm 2\sqrt{3}$.
$x = 6 \mp 2\sqrt{3}$.

We know that $6 < x \le 12$.
Case 1: $x = 6 + 2\sqrt{3}$.
$2\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{12}$. $3 < \sqrt{12} < 4$.
$6 + 3 < 6 + \sqrt{12} < 6 + 4$, so $9 < x < 10$. This is within the range $(6, 12]$.

Case 2: $x = 6 - 2\sqrt{3}$.
$6 - 4 < 6 - \sqrt{12} < 6 - 3$, so $2 < x < 3$. This is not in the range $(6, 12]$.

Therefore, $x = 6 + 2\sqrt{3}$.

Now we need to find $AP$.
$AP = \text{distance from } A=(0,12) \text{ to } P=(x, 12-x)$.
$AP = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (12-x-12)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (-x)^2} = \sqrt{2x^2} = |x|\sqrt{2}$.
Since $x > 0$, $AP = x\sqrt{2}$.

$AP = (6 + 2\sqrt{3})\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{3}\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{6} = \sqrt{36 \cdot 2} + \sqrt{4 \cdot 6} = \sqrt{72} + \sqrt{24}$.

We are given $AP = \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}$.
So, $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{72} + \sqrt{24}$.
We need to find $a+b$.
If $a=72, b=24$, then $a+b = 72+24 = 96$.
If $a=24, b=72$, then $a+b = 24+72 = 96$.

We need to ensure $a$ and $b$ are positive integers.
$72$ and $24$ are positive integers.

Let's double-check the calculations.

Consider the geometry of the circumcenters.
$O_1$ is the center of the circle passing through $A, B, P$.
$O_2$ is the center of the circle passing through $C, D, P$.

The coordinates of the circumcenters seem correct.

Let's check the angle calculation.
The angle between two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ is given by $\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{u}| |\mathbf{v}|}$.
$\cos(120^{\circ}) = -\frac{1}{2}$.
$\frac{(6-x)^2 - 36}{\sqrt{(6-x)^2 + 36} \sqrt{(6-x)^2 + 36}} = -\frac{1}{2}$.
$\frac{(6-x)^2 - 36}{(6-x)^2 + 36} = -\frac{1}{2}$.
$2((6-x)^2 - 36) = -((6-x)^2 + 36)$.
$2(6-x)^2 - 72 = -(6-x)^2 - 36$.
$3(6-x)^2 = 72 - 36 = 36$.
$(6-x)^2 = 12$.

The range of $x$ was $6 < x \le 12$.
This means $6-x$ is negative, $6-x < 0$.
So, $6-x = -\sqrt{12} = -2\sqrt{3}$.
$x = 6 + 2\sqrt{3}$. This matches the previous result.

Now consider the calculation of $AP$.
$P$ lies on the diagonal $AC$, which has equation $y = 12-x$.
A point on the diagonal can be parameterized as $(t, 12-t)$.
$AP = \sqrt{(t-0)^2 + (12-t-12)^2} = \sqrt{t^2 + (-t)^2} = \sqrt{2t^2} = |t|\sqrt{2}$.
Here, the $x$-coordinate of $P$ is $x$, so $t=x$.
$AP = x\sqrt{2}$.

Given $\angle O_1PO_2 = 120^{\circ}$.
The angle between vectors $\vec{PO_1}$ and $\vec{PO_2}$ is $120^{\circ}$.

Check the condition $AP > CP$.
$AP = x\sqrt{2}$.
$CP = (12-x)\sqrt{2}$.
$x\sqrt{2} > (12-x)\sqrt{2} \implies x > 12-x \implies 2x > 12 \implies x > 6$.

Final answer: $a+b = 72+24 = 96$.

Let's think if there are other possible values for $a$ and $b$.
If $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{72} + \sqrt{24}$, and $a, b$ are positive integers.
Possible pairs $(a, b)$ such that $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = 6\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{6}$.
Squaring both sides: $a + b + 2\sqrt{ab} = 72 + 24 + 2\sqrt{72 \cdot 24} = 96 + 2\sqrt{1728}$.
$1728 = 576 \times 3 = 24^2 \times 3$.
$2\sqrt{1728} = 2 \cdot 24\sqrt{3} = 48\sqrt{3}$.
$a + b + 2\sqrt{ab} = 96 + 48\sqrt{3}$.

If $ab$ is not a perfect square, then we must have:
$a+b = 96$ and $2\sqrt{ab} = 48\sqrt{3}$, so $4ab = 48^2 \cdot 3 = 2304 \cdot 3 = 6912$.
$ab = 1728$.
We have $a+b=96$ and $ab=1728$.
Consider the quadratic equation $t^2 - (a+b)t + ab = 0$, so $t^2 - 96t + 1728 = 0$.
Discriminant $\Delta = (-96)^2 - 4(1)(1728) = 9216 - 6912 = 2304 = 48^2$.
Roots $t = \frac{96 \pm 48}{2}$.
$t_1 = \frac{96+48}{2} = \frac{144}{2} = 72$.
$t_2 = \frac{96-48}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24$.
So, $\{a, b\} = \{72, 24\}$.

If $ab$ is a perfect square, then $\sqrt{a}$ and $\sqrt{b}$ are multiples of the same square root.
Example: $\sqrt{8} + \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} = 3\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{18}$.
Here, $a=8, b=2$, $a+b=10$. $\sqrt{18} = \sqrt{a+b+2\sqrt{ab}} = \sqrt{10+2\sqrt{16}} = \sqrt{10+8} = \sqrt{18}$.

We have $AP = 6\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{6} = \sqrt{72} + \sqrt{24}$.
Since $\sqrt{72}$ and $\sqrt{24}$ are not multiples of the same square root, the representation $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}$ is unique up to the order of $a$ and $b$.

The problem statement implies a unique value for $a+b$.
Final check of the problem details.
Square $ABCD$, $AB=12$.
Point $P$ on diagonal $AC$, $AP > CP$.
Circumcenters $O_1$ of $\triangle ABP$, $O_2$ of $\triangle CDP$.
$\angle O_1PO_2 = 120^{\circ}$.

The setup and calculations seem correct.
The value of $a+b$ should be $72+24 = 96$.

<text>Let the vertices of the square be $A=(0,12)$, $B=(12,12)$, $C=(12,0)$, $D=(0,0)$.
The diagonal $AC$ lies on the line $y = 12 - x$.
Let $P$ be a point on $AC$. Since $AP > CP$, $P$ is closer to $A$ than to $C$.
The coordinates of a point on $AC$ can be parameterized. Let $P = (x, 12-x)$.
Since $P$ is on $AC$, we have $0 \le x \le 12$.
The midpoint of $AC$ is $(\frac{0+12}{2}, \frac{12+0}{2}) = (6, 6)$.
For $AP > CP$, $P$ must lie on the segment from $A$ to the midpoint of $AC$.</text>
<explanation>The solver breaks down the problem by first establishing a coordinate system and determining the constraints on point P's position, showing strategic decomposition of the problem into manageable steps.</explanation>

<text>Circumcenter $O_1$ of $\triangle ABP$:
$A=(0,12)$, $B=(12,12)$, $P=(x, 12-x)$.
The perpendicular bisector of $AB$ is the line $x = \frac{0+12}{2} = 6$.
The circumcenter $O_1$ lies on $x=6$. Let $O_1 = (6, y_1)$.
$O_1A^2 = (6-0)^2 + (y_1-12)^2 = 36 + (y_1-12)^2$.
$O_1B^2 = (6-12)^2 + (y_1-12)^2 = 36 + (y_1-12)^2$.
$O_1P^2 = (6-x)^2 + (y_1-(12-x))^2 = (6-x)^2 + (y_1-12+x)^2$.
$O_1A^2 = O_1P^2 \implies 36 + (y_1-12)^2 = (6-x)^2 + (y_1-12+x)^2$.
$36 + y_1^2 - 24y_1 + 144 = 36 - 12x + x^2 + (y_1-12)^2 + 2x(y_1-12) + x^2$.
$36 + y_1^2 - 24y_1 + 144 = 36 - 12x + x^2 + y_1^2 - 24y_1 + 144 + 2xy_1 - 24x + x^2$.
$0 = -12x + 2x^2 + 2xy_1 - 24x$.
$0 = 2x^2 - 36x + 2xy_1$.
Since $x > 6$, $x \ne 0$. Divide by $2x$:
$0 = x - 18 + y_1$, so $y_1 = 18 - x$.
$O_1 = (6, 18-x)$.</text>
<explanation>The solver systematically determines the coordinates of circumcenter O₁ by applying the definition of a circumcenter and working through a sequence of algebraic steps, demonstrating effective problem decomposition and methodical problem-solving.</explanation>

<text>Now we need to find $AP$.
$AP = \text{distance from } A=(0,12) \text{ to } P=(x, 12-x)$.
$AP = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (12-x-12)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (-x)^2} = \sqrt{2x^2} = |x|\sqrt{2}
