Problem:
A molecule consists of three atoms with spin Â½ each. The spin vector of the molecule can be written as $s = \sigma/2$, where $\sigma$ are Pauli matrices. The interaction Hamiltonian of the molecule is due to spin interactions and can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} = \frac{\lambda}{3} [ (\sigma_1 \cdot  \sigma_2) + (\sigma_2 \cdot \sigma_3) + (\sigma_3 \cdot \sigma_1)]
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ describes the strength of the interaction and $\sigma_{1,2,3}$ are Pauli spin matrices for individual atoms, which commute among themselves such that $\sigma_1^2 =\sigma_2^2= \sigma_3^2 = 1$ and the total spin of the molecule is 
\begin{equation}

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
The problem asks for the description of the molecular states of a system of three spin-1/2 particles. The interaction Hamiltonian is given, and the total spin operator is also given.

The number of possible spin states for each atom is 2 (spin up or spin down). Since there are three atoms, the total number of possible spin states for the molecule is $2^3 = 8$.

We need to combine the spins of the three atoms. Let the spin of the individual atoms be $s_1, s_2, s_3$, with $s_i = 1/2$.

First, combine two spins: $s_1 + s_2$. The possible values of the total spin $S_{12}$ are $|s_1 - s_2|$ to $s_1 + s_2$. In this case, $|1/2 - 1/2| = 0$ and $1/2 + 1/2 = 1$. So $S_{12} = 0$ (singlet) or $S_{12} = 1$ (triplet).

Now, combine $S_{12}$ with the third spin $s_3 = 1/2$.

Case 1: $S_{12} = 0$. Combining with $s_3 = 1/2$, the total spin $S$ can be $|0 - 1/2|$ to $0 + 1/2$, which is $S = 1/2$. The multiplicity is $2S + 1 = 2(1/2) + 1 = 2$. This corresponds to a doublet.

Case 2: $S_{12} = 1$. Combining with $s_3 = 1/2$, the total spin $S$ can be $|1 - 1/2|$ to $1 + 1/2$. So $S = 1/2$ or $S = 3/2$.
For $S = 1/2$, the multiplicity is $2(1/2) + 1 = 2$, a doublet.
For $S = 3/2$, the multiplicity is $2(3/2) + 1 = 4$, a quadruplet.

Let's consider the number of states for each total spin.
For $S_{12} = 0$ (singlet), there is 1 state. Combining with $s_3 = 1/2$ (2 states), we get $1 \times 2 = 2$ states with total spin $S = 1/2$.
For $S_{12} = 1$ (triplet), there are 3 states. Combining with $s_3 = 1/2$ (2 states), we get $3 \times 2 = 6$ states. These 6 states are distributed into $S = 1/2$ and $S = 3/2$.
The number of states for $S=3/2$ is $2S+1 = 4$.
The number of states for $S=1/2$ is $2S+1 = 2$.
So, the 6 states from combining the triplet and the single spin are composed of 4 quadruplet states and 2 doublet states.

Combining the results from both cases:
From Case 1 ($S_{12} = 0$), we have 2 doublet states (S = 1/2).
From Case 2 ($S_{12} = 1$), we have 4 quadruplet states (S = 3/2) and 2 doublet states (S = 1/2).

Total number of states = 8, which matches $2^3$.

The total spin quantum number $S$ can be $1/2$ or $3/2$.

For $S = 3/2$, the multiplicity is $2S + 1 = 4$. This corresponds to a quadruplet.
For $S = 1/2$, the multiplicity is $2S + 1 = 2$. This corresponds to a doublet.

We need to determine how many independent quadruplets and doublets exist.

Consider the possible combinations of the z-components of the individual spins ($m_{s_1}, m_{s_2}, m_{s_3}$), each can be $+1/2$ or $-1/2$.
Total 8 states:
+++, ++-, +-+ , -++, +--, -+-, --+, ---

Total $S_z = m_{s_1} + m_{s_2} + m_{s_3}$

$S_z = 3/2$: +++ (1 state)  =>  $S = 3/2$
$S_z = 1/2$: ++-, +-+ , -++ (3 states) => part of $S = 3/2$ and $S = 1/2$
$S_z = -1/2$: +--, -+-, --+ (3 states) => part of $S = 3/2$ and $S = 1/2$
$S_z = -3/2$: --- (1 state) => $S = 3/2$

The states with $S_z = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2$ form a quadruplet ($S=3/2$).

We have 8 total states. 4 states form the quadruplet. The remaining $8 - 4 = 4$ states must form doublets ($S=1/2$).
Since each doublet has 2 states, $4 / 2 = 2$ doublets.

So we have 1 quadruplet and 2 doublets.

Let's try to use the given Hamiltonian to understand the energy levels.

$\hat{H} = \frac{\lambda}{3} [ (\sigma_1 \cdot  \sigma_2) + (\sigma_2 \cdot \sigma_3) + (\sigma_3 \cdot \sigma_1)]$

We know that $(\sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j) = 4 (s_i \cdot s_j)$.
Also, $S^2 = (s_1 + s_2 + s_3)^2 = s_1^2 + s_2^2 + s_3^2 + 2(s_1 \cdot s_2 + s_1 \cdot s_3 + s_2 \cdot s_3)$.
$s_i^2 = s_i(s_i+1) = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2}+1) = \frac{3}{4}$.
$S^2 = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{4} + 2(s_1 \cdot s_2 + s_1 \cdot s_3 + s_2 \cdot s_3)$
$S^2 = \frac{9}{4} + 2(s_1 \cdot s_2 + s_1 \cdot s_3 + s_2 \cdot s_3)$
$2(s_1 \cdot s_2 + s_1 \cdot s_3 + s_2 \cdot s_3) = S^2 - \frac{9}{4}$
$s_1 \cdot s_2 + s_1 \cdot s_3 + s_2 \cdot s_3 = \frac{1}{2} (S^2 - \frac{9}{4})$

Substitute $s = \sigma/2$, so $\sigma = 2s$.
$\sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j = 4 (s_i \cdot s_j)$.

$\hat{H} = \frac{\lambda}{3} [ 4(s_1 \cdot  s_2) + 4(s_2 \cdot s_3) + 4(s_3 \cdot s_1)]$
$\hat{H} = \frac{4\lambda}{3} [ s_1 \cdot  s_2 + s_2 \cdot s_3 + s_3 \cdot s_1]$
$\hat{H} = \frac{4\lambda}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} (S^2 - \frac{9}{4}) = \frac{2\lambda}{3} (S^2 - \frac{9}{4})$

The eigenvalues of $S^2$ are $S(S+1)$.
If $S = 3/2$, $S^2 = \frac{3}{2}(\frac{3}{2}+1) = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{15}{4}$.
If $S = 1/2$, $S^2 = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2}+1) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3}{4}$.

Energy for $S = 3/2$:
$E_{3/2} = \frac{2\lambda}{3} (\frac{15}{4} - \frac{9}{4}) = \frac{2\lambda}{3} (\frac{6}{4}) = \frac{2\lambda}{3} \times \frac{3}{2} = \lambda$.

Energy for $S = 1/2$:
$E_{1/2} = \frac{2\lambda}{3} (\frac{3}{4} - \frac{9}{4}) = \frac{2\lambda}{3} (-\frac{6}{4}) = \frac{2\lambda}{3} (-\frac{3}{2}) = -\lambda$.

The energy levels are $\lambda$ and $-\lambda$.
The degeneracy of the energy level $\lambda$ corresponds to the multiplicity of the $S = 3/2$ state, which is 4 (quadruplet).
The degeneracy of the energy level $-\lambda$ corresponds to the multiplicity of the $S = 1/2$ state, which is 2 (doublet).

However, this approach only gives the possible total spin values and their multiplicities. It doesn't directly tell us how many independent doublets or quadruplets exist.

Let's go back to the addition of angular momentum.
We have three spin-1/2 particles. The possible total spin states can be found by considering the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Alternatively, consider the symmetry of the states.
The basis states are $|\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \rangle$, $|\uparrow \uparrow \downarrow \rangle$, $|\uparrow \downarrow \uparrow \rangle$, $|\downarrow \uparrow \uparrow \rangle$, $|\uparrow \downarrow \downarrow \rangle$, $|\downarrow \uparrow \downarrow \rangle$, $|\downarrow \downarrow \uparrow \rangle$, $|\downarrow \downarrow \downarrow \rangle$.

The state with the highest $S_z = 3/2$ is $|\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \rangle$, which belongs to the $S = 3/2$ multiplet.
The states with $S_z = 1/2$ are $|\uparrow \uparrow \downarrow \rangle$, $|\uparrow \downarrow \uparrow \rangle$, $|\downarrow \uparrow \uparrow \rangle$.
Linear combinations of these states can form the other $S_z = 1/2$ member of the $S = 3/2$ quadruplet, and some states belonging to the $S = 1/2$ doublets.

The quadruplet states ($S=3/2$) are symmetric under exchange of any two spins.
Symmetric combination for $S_z = 1/2$: $|\uparrow \uparrow \downarrow \rangle + |\uparrow \downarrow \uparrow \rangle + |\downarrow \uparrow \uparrow \rangle$.

To find the doublet states, we need states that are orthogonal to the quadruplet states.
Consider the process of adding angular momentum step-by-step:
Combine $s_1$ and $s_2$: gives a singlet ($S_{12}=0$) and a triplet ($S_{12}=1$).
Singlet state: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow \downarrow \rangle - |\downarrow \uparrow \rangle)$.
Triplet states: $|\uparrow \uparrow \rangle$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow \downarrow \rangle + |\downarrow \uparrow \rangle)$, $|\downarrow \downarrow \rangle$.

Now combine with $s_3$:
Combine singlet ($S_{12}=0$) with $s_3=1/2$:
Total $S = 1/2$. The two states are:
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow \downarrow \rangle - |\downarrow \uparrow \rangle) |\uparrow \rangle$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow \downarrow \rangle - |\downarrow \uparrow \rangle) |\downarrow \rangle$.
These should be properly symmetrized/antisymmetrized.

Let's use a more formal approach using Young diagrams.
For three spin-1/2 particles, the fundamental representation is of dimension 2.
The product of three such representations is $2 \otimes 2 \otimes 2$.
$2 \otimes 2 = 3 \oplus 1$ (triplet and singlet).
$(3 \oplus 1) \otimes 2 = (3 \otimes 2) \oplus (1 \otimes 2)$.
$3 \otimes 2 = 4 \oplus 2$ (quadruplet and doublet).
$1 \otimes 2 = 2$ (doublet).

So the reduction is $4 \oplus 2 \oplus 2$.
This means one quadruplet (dimension 4) and two doublets (dimension 2 each).

The dimensions match the number of states: $4 + 2 + 2 = 8$.

This indicates 1 quadruplet and 2 doublets.

Let's double-check the meaning of "identical doublets". This likely refers to doublets that transform according to the same irreducible representation of the permutation group $S_3$.

The symmetry of the three spins can be:
- Fully symmetric: corresponds to the quadruplet ($S=3/2$).
- Mixed symmetry: corresponds to the doublets ($S=1/2$).

The 8 basis states can be grouped according to their symmetry under permutation of the particle labels.
- Fully symmetric: $|\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \rangle$, $|\downarrow \downarrow \downarrow \rangle$, and symmetric combinations of two up/one down and one up/two down. These form the basis of the $S=3/2$ representation (dimension 4).
- Mixed symmetry: the remaining states form the basis of the two $S=1/2$ representations (dimension 2 each).

Consider the total spin operator $S = s_1 + s_2 + s_3$.
Eigenvalues of $S^2$ are $S(S+1) = 3/2 \times 5/2 = 15/4$ for quadruplet, and $1/2 \times 3/2 = 3/4$ for doublet.

The number of possible spin states is $2^3 = 8$.
The possible values of the total spin $S$ are $3/2$ and $1/2$.
The number of states with $S=3/2$ is $2S+1 = 4$. These form a quadruplet.
The number of states with $S=1/2$ is $2S+1 = 2$.

We need to determine how many independent sets of $S=1/2$ states exist.

Consider the construction of the states.
Start with $|\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \rangle$, $S=3/2, S_z=3/2$.
Lowering operator $S_- = s_{1-} + s_{2-} + s_{3-}$.
$S_- |\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \rangle = |\downarrow \uparrow \uparrow \rangle + |\uparrow \downarrow \uparrow \rangle + |\uparrow \uparrow \downarrow \rangle$, which is the $S_z=1/2$ state of the quadruplet.

Consider the two ways to form $S=1/2$:
1. Combine $s_1$ and $s_2$ to get singlet ($S_{12}=0$), then combine with $s_3$.
2. Combine $s_1$ and $s_2$ to get triplet ($S_{12}=1$), then combine with $s_3$.

Case 1: $S_{12}=0$, state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow \downarrow \rangle - |\downarrow \uparrow \rangle)$.
Combine with $|\uparrow \rangle$: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow \downarrow \uparrow \rangle - |\downarrow \uparrow \uparrow \rangle)$. $S=1/2, S_z=1/2$.
Combine with $|\downarrow \rangle$: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow \downarrow \downarrow \rangle - |\downarrow \uparrow \downarrow \rangle)$. $S=1/2, S_z=-1/2$.
These two states form one doublet.

Case 2: $S_{12}=1$, triplet states: $|\uparrow \uparrow \rangle$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow \downarrow \rangle + |\downarrow \uparrow \rangle)$, $|\downarrow \downarrow \rangle$.
Combine triplet with $s_3=1/2$.
From $M=1$ triplet and $m= -1/2$ spin, we get $S=1/2$.
From $M=0$ triplet and $m= 1/2$ spin, we get $S=1/2$.
From $M=-1$ triplet and $m= 1/2$ spin, we get $S=1/2$.

The coupling $1 \otimes 1/2 = 3/2 \oplus 1/2$.
This generates one quadruplet and one doublet.

Combining the two cases: one doublet from the singlet combination and one doublet from the triplet combination.
Together with the quadruplet from the triplet combination.

Total: 1 quadruplet and 2 doublets.

The term "identical doublets" suggests they have the same quantum numbers (other than the magnetic quantum number $m$). In this case, they both have $S=1/2$.

Final check:
Total number of states = 8.
Quadruplet has 4 states ($S=3/2, m = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2$).
Two doublets each have 2 states ($S=1/2, m = 1/2, -1/2$).
$4 + 2 + 2 = 8$.

The description matches option (D).
