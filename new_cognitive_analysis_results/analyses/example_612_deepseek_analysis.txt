Problem:
There are real numbers $a, b, c,$ and $d$ such that $-20$ is a root of $x^3 + ax + b$ and $-21$ is a root of $x^3 + cx^2 + d.$ These two polynomials share a complex root $m + \sqrt{n} \cdot i,$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find $m+n.$

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. It's about polynomials with real coefficients that share a complex root. Hmm. Let's parse what the problem is asking.

First, there are two cubic polynomials:

1. The first polynomial is \( x^3 + a x + b \), where -20 is a root. So, if we plug in x = -20, the polynomial equals zero.

2. The second polynomial is \( x^3 + c x^2 + d \), where -21 is a root. Similarly, plugging in x = -21 should make this polynomial zero.

Additionally, both polynomials share a complex root of the form \( m + \sqrt{n} \cdot i \), where m and n are positive integers. We need to find m + n.

Key points to note:

- All coefficients of the polynomials are real numbers. Therefore, complex roots must come in conjugate pairs. That means if \( m + \sqrt{n}i \) is a root, then \( m - \sqrt{n}i \) must also be a root of the same polynomial.

- However, the first polynomial is cubic and has -20 as a root. So, the other two roots must be complex conjugates. Similarly, the second polynomial is cubic with -21 as a root, so the other two roots must be complex conjugates as well.

But the problem states that both polynomials share a common complex root \( m + \sqrt{n}i \). Therefore, each polynomial must have both \( m + \sqrt{n}i \) and its conjugate \( m - \sqrt{n}i \) as roots because their coefficients are real. Therefore, since the first polynomial has roots -20, \( m + \sqrt{n}i \), \( m - \sqrt{n}i \), and the second polynomial has roots -21, \( m + \sqrt{n}i \), \( m - \sqrt{n}i \).

Wait, but wait, the first polynomial is \( x^3 + a x + b \). Let's note that the first polynomial is a cubic with leading coefficient 1, as is the second polynomial. Both of these polynomials are monic (leading coefficient 1). So, we can express each polynomial in terms of their roots.

For the first polynomial: \( (x + 20)(x - (m + \sqrt{n}i))(x - (m - \sqrt{n}i)) \)

Multiply the complex conjugate pair: \( (x - m - \sqrt{n}i)(x - m + \sqrt{n}i) = (x - m)^2 - (\sqrt{n}i)^2 = (x - m)^2 + n \), since \( (\sqrt{n}i)^2 = -n \).

Therefore, the polynomial can be written as \( (x + 20)((x - m)^2 + n) \).

Similarly, expand this to standard form:

First, expand \( (x - m)^2 + n \):

\( x^2 - 2 m x + m^2 + n \)

Multiply by (x + 20):

\( x^3 - 2 m x^2 + (m^2 + n) x + 20 x^2 - 40 m x + 20(m^2 + n) \)

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \)

- \( (-2 m + 20) x^2 \)

- \( (m^2 + n - 40 m) x \)

- \( 20(m^2 + n) \)

But the given polynomial is \( x^3 + a x + b \), which means the coefficients of \( x^2 \) and the constant term should match.

Wait, but the original first polynomial is \( x^3 + a x + b \). That implies that the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 0 and the coefficient of x is a, and the constant term is b.

But when we expand the factored form, we get coefficients:

- Coefficient of \( x^3 \): 1, which matches.

- Coefficient of \( x^2 \): (-2m + 20). For this polynomial, the x2 term coefficient is 0. Therefore,

-2m + 20 = 0 => -2m = -20 => m = 10.

So, right away, m must be 10.

Then, the linear term (coefficient of x) from our expansion is \( m^2 + n - 40 m \). But that's supposed to be equal to a.

Given m = 10,

Coefficient of x: (10)^2 + n - 40*10 = 100 + n - 400 = n - 300. So, a = n - 300.

The constant term is 20(m^2 + n) = 20(100 + n) = 2000 + 20n = b.

So, from this, expressions for a and b are in terms of n.

Similarly, let's handle the second polynomial: \( x^3 + c x^2 + d \), which has roots -21 and the complex pair \( m + \sqrt{n}i \), \( m - \sqrt{n}i \).

Given m = 10 from the previous polynomial. But we need to verify this. Wait, if m is already 10 for the first polynomial, can it be different for the second? But the problem states that the complex root is SHARED by both polynomials, so m must be the same in both. Therefore, we can carry over m = 10 to the second polynomial.

Therefore, let's analyze the second polynomial.

Similarly, roots: -21, 10 + √n i, 10 - √n i.

So, it factors as \( (x + 21)(x - (10 + \sqrt{n} i))(x - (10 - \sqrt{n} i)) \).

Again, multiply the complex conjugate pair first:

\( (x - 10 - \sqrt{n}i)(x - 10 + \sqrt{n}i) = (x - 10)^2 - (√n i)^2 = (x - 10)^2 + n \).

So, that quadratic part is same as the first polynomial.

Thus, the second polynomial is \( (x + 21)((x - 10)^2 + n) \). Expand this.

First, expand \( (x - 10)^2 + n = x^2 - 20x + 100 + n \)

Multiply by (x + 21):

Multiply term by term:

x*(x^2 - 20x + 100 + n) +21*(x^2 -20x +100 +n)=

x^3 -20x^2 + (100 +n)x +21x^2 -420x +21*(100 +n)

Combine like terms:

x^3 + (-20x^2 +21x^2) + [(100+n)x -420x] +21*(100 +n)

Simplify:

x^3 + x^2 + (100 +n -420)x +21*(100 +n)

Coefficient of x^3: 1

Coefficient of x^2: (-20+21)=1

Coefficient of x: (100 +n -420) = (n - 320)

Constant term: 21(100 +n) = 2100 +21n

But the given polynomial is x3 + c x2 + d. That is, there is no x term. Wait, hold on: original second polynomial is \( x^3 + c x^2 + d \). So, coefficients of x term is 0, and the coefficient of x2 is c, and the constant term is d. Therefore, comparing:

Coefficient of x2=1 so c = 1

Coefficient of x is n -360; but given polynomial has 0.

Wait: Correcting the arithmetic when we calculated the coefficient of x: 100 +n -420. Let's do that again. 100 + n -420 = -320 +n. So, yes, n -320. But the polynomial is stated to be \(x^3 + c x2 + d\), so the coefficient of x is 0. Therefore, n -320 =0 => n=320.

Wait, 320? But n is supposed to be a positive integer such that there's a complex number m + sqrt(n) i. So sqrt(n) * i is a complex number is given. Since complex roots, then n must be positive. Now, n =320, so check m=10, comes from first polynomial.

Wait. Let's check again for the x coefficient for the second polynomial. Yes:

First, (x +21)((x -10)^2 +n) expanding: The initial steps:

(x -10)^2 +n = x2 -20x +100 +n.

Multiply by (x +21):

x*(x2 -20x +100 +n) +21*(x2 -20x +100 +n) =

x3 -20x2 + (100 +n)x +21x2 -420x +21*(100 +n)

Combine: x3 + ( -20x2 +21x2 ) + [ (100 +n)x -420x ] + 21*(100 +n)

So, x3 + x2 -(320 -n)x +2100 +21n.

Wait, hold on, in the x term, (100 +n -420)x = (n -320)x.

So, in the given polynomial, x3 +c x2 +d, there's no x term, so (n -320) must equal zero. Thus, n =320. Similarly, the coefficients:

Coefficient of x2 is 1, so for the polynomial it's stated to be c. Hence c =1.

The constant term is 2100 +21n. Since n=320, then constant term is 2100 +21*320 = ?

Let's calculate: 21 *320 is 6720. 2100 +6720= 8820. Therefore, d=8820.

But in the second polynomial, are there any constraints? Just that -21 is a root, but we already took care of that. So, this seems consistent.

Going back to the first polynomial, we also mentioned that through expansions, we found:

From m=10, the quadratic term is (x-10)^2 +n.

Then, we had for the first polynomial:

(x +20)[(x-10)^2 +n]. Then expanding:

(x +20)(x2 -20x +100 +n) = x3 -20x2 + (100 +n)x +20x2 -400x +20*(100 +n)

Which simplifies to x3 + [ -20x2 +20x2 ] + [ (100 +n)x -400x ] + 2000 +20n

x3 (n = 320?) x coefficient term is (100 +320 -400)x = (420 -400) x =20 x. Wait, hold on, this contradicts because originally, the first polynomial is x3 + a x + b. That would need coefficients:

Original polynomial is x3 + a x + b, so coefficient of x2 is 0, which matched because 1*x3 +0*x2 + a x +b.

But in our expansion for the first polynomial (x +20)[(x -10)^2 +n], when expanding we have:

x3 + ( -20(m) +20 )x2 + ( m2 +n - 40m )x +20(m2 +n ). Wait, but hold on—maybe I miscalculated earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps let me re-express the first polynomial's expansion step again carefully.

First polynomial factors: (x +20)(x2 - 20x +100 +n) - but hang on, wait, (x -10)^2 +n = x2 -20x +100 +n. So the first polynomial is (x +20)(x2 -20x +100 +n). Expand this term by term:

First: multiply x by the quadratic:

x*(x2 -20x +100 +n)=x3 -20x2 + (100 +n)x.

Multiply 20 by the quadratic:

20*(x2 -20x +100 +n)=20x2 -400x +2000 +20n.

Add these two results together:

x3 -20x2 + (100+n)x +20x2 -400x +2000 +20n.

Then combine like terms:

x3: x3

x2 terms: (-20x2 +20x2)=0

x terms: (100 +n)x -400x = (n -300)x

constant term:2000 +20n.

Therefore, the first polynomial is x3 + (n-300)x + (2000 +20n). Comparing with the given polynomial x3 + a x + b, so we can set:

a = n -300

b=2000 +20n

Similarly, the second polynomial's expansion gave us:

x3 +x2 + (n -320)x +2100 +21n.

But given that the polynomial is x3 +c x2 +d, there the coefficients of x must be zero, and the coefficients of x2 is c (which is 1, as per expansion above). Wait, but c can't necessarily be precluded to being 1—wait, in our previous expansion of the second polynomial, the coefficient of x2 came from (-20 +21)x2, which is 1. So the c coefficient is 1. However, in the problem statement, it's written as x3 +c x2 + d, so c must equal to 1, and d=2100 +21n. But we needed to set n such that the coefficient of x term is zero. From there:

n -320 =0 =>n=320.

Therefore, n=320. Then for the first polynomial, a =n -300=320-300=20, and b=2000 +20*320= 2000+6400=8400. For the second polynomial c=1, d=2100 +21*320=2100+6720=8820.

But let's check all constraints for consistency.

First polynomial: x3 +20x +8400. Let's check if x=-20 is a root. Plugging in (-20)^3 +20*(-20)+8400= -8000 -400 +8400=0. Yes, that works. Good.

Second polynomial: x3 +x2 +8820. Plugging in x=-21: (-21)^3 + (-21)^2 +8820. Calculate:

First, (-21)^3= -21*21*21= -21*441= -9261.

(-21)^2=441.

So total: -9261 +441 +8820= (-9261 + 441)= -8820, then -8820 +8820=0. Correct. So that's a root.

Now, but the problem mentioned that these polynomials share a complex root 10 + sqrt(n)i. Wait, n=320. Therefore, the complex root is 10 +sqrt(320)i. But sqrt(320)=sqrt(64*5)=8*sqrt(5). Wait. Wait: the problem states that m and n are positive integers, and the complex root is m + sqrt(n)*i. Therefore, in this case, sqrt(n) needs to produce 8*sqrt(5), so sqrt(n)=8*sqrt(5) implies n=(8*sqrt(5))2=64*5=320. Therefore, n=320.

So m=10 and n=320. Then m +n= 10 +320=330. Wait, so that would be the answer? However, the problem statement says m and n are positive integers. Yes, 10 and 320. 330 is the sum.

But sqrt(320) can be simplified further, but the problem might expect it presented in terms of sqrt(n). Since perhaps the problem expects that complex root is written as m + sqrt(n) i where sqrt(n) is simplified in the sense that n is square-free? Wait, no, the problem states that "where m and n are positive integers and i=\sqrt{-1}". It doesn't specify n must be square-free or anything, so as long as there's a real number sqrt(n), which would just mean n is a positive integer. So writing the root as 10 + sqrt(320)i is valid and n=320 in this case.

But let me think again—does sqrt(n) have to be an integer? The problem says "m + sqrt{n} \cdot i, where m and n are positive integers". Therefore, only m and n must be positive integers. sqrt(n) doesn't have be integer. For example, even if n=2, sqrt(2) isn't an integer, but n is. Therefore, the expression is m + sqrt{n}i, m, n integers. That's that.

Therefore, indeed, m=10, n=320, sum 330.

But wait a moment—just to check if we did not miscalculate with coefficient signs. Let's step back.

First polynomial:

-20 is a root, and given polynomial is x3 + a x + b => (x +20)(x2 -20x +100 +320). But x2 -20x +100 +320 is x2 -20x +420. So (x +20)(x2 -20x +420). Expanding:

x3 -20x2 +420x +20x2 -400x +8400. Combine:

x3 + ( -20x2 +20x2 ) + (420x -400x) +8400 = x3 +20x +8400. Therefore, f(-20)= -8000 + (-400)+8400=0 is correct. Correct. -20 is a root.

Similarly, the roots of these quadratics for complex roots are solving x2 -20x +420=0. Wait, that quadratic equation gives roots.

But wait, if in the first polynomial, the complex roots come from x2 -20x +420 =0. Let me solve the quadratic equation:

x2 -20x +420 =0.

Discriminant= 400 - 1680= -1280. Therefore, the roots are [20 ±sqrt(-1280)]/2= [20 ±i sqrt(1280)]/2=10 ±i sqrt(320). Which is the given form m ±sqrt(n)i, with m=10 and n=320. So that's correct.

Similarly, the second polynomial's complex roots come from (x -10)^2 +320 =0. Wait, no, let's check:

Second polynomial once factored is (x+21)((x -10)^2 + 320).

The complex roots are solutions to (x -10)^2 +320=0, so (x -10)^2 =-320 => x -10= ±i sqrt(320) => x=10 ±i sqrt(320). So same as above. Therefore, the complex roots are 10 ± sqrt(320)i, which is as given. Hence m=10, n=320, sum 330.

Hence, the answer is 10 + 320= 330.

But just a sanity check. The problem is whether my step where I concluded that m=10 for the first polynomial was correct, isn't it?

Yes. In the first polynomial, once we factored given root -20 and multiplied by (x2 -2mx +m2 +n), and then expanded. When equating to x^3 + ax +b, which has coefficient of x2=0. Therefore, the coefficient calculated as -2m +20 must equal 0. Hence, m=10.

So since m must be shared with the other polynomial (as they share the same complex root m +sqrt(n)i ), thus no problem here, m=10 is forced from first polynomial, which carried over to the second.

Moreover, solving the second polynomial required also that n=320, in order for the coefficient of x to be zero. Then, combining both gives the required answer.

Yes, seems correct despite n being a large number.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{330}
