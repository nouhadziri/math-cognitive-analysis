Problem:
Carl chooses a *functional expression**  $E$  which is a finite nonempty string formed from a set  $x_1, x_2, \dots$  of variables and applications of a function  $f$ , together with addition, subtraction, multiplication (but not division), and fixed real constants. He then considers the equation  $E = 0$ , and lets  $S$  denote the set of functions  $f \colon \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$  such that the equation holds for any choices of real numbers  $x_1, x_2, \dots$ . (For example, if Carl chooses the functional equation  $$  f(2f(x_1)+x_2) - 2f(x_1)-x_2 = 0,  $$  then  $S$  consists of one function, the identity function.

(a) Let  $X$  denote the set of functions with domain  $\mathbb R$  and image exactly  $\mathbb Z$ . Show that Carl can choose his functional equation such that  $S$  is nonempty but  $S \subseteq X$ .

(b) Can Carl choose his functional equation such that  $|S|=1$  and  $S \subseteq X$ ?

*These can be defined formally in the following way: the set of functional expressions is the minimal one (by inclusion) such that (i) any fixed real constant is a functional expression, (ii) for any positive integer  $i$ , the variable  $x_i$  is a functional expression, and (iii) if  $V$  and  $W$  are functional expressions, then so are  $f(V)$ ,  $V+W$ ,  $V-W$ , and  $V \cdot W$ .

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks about the possibility of constructing functional equations $E=0$ such that the set of solutions $S$ has certain properties, where $S$ is the set of functions $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying the equation for all real values of the variables.

Part (a): Show that Carl can choose his functional equation such that $S$ is nonempty but $S \subseteq X$, where $X$ is the set of functions $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with image exactly $\mathbb{Z}$.

We need to find a functional equation $E=0$ such that any function $f$ satisfying the equation for all $x_1, x_2, \dots$ has its image exactly $\mathbb{Z}$, and there exists at least one such function.

Consider the equation $f(x_1) - \lfloor f(x_1) \rfloor = 0$. This equation holds if and only if $f(x_1) = \lfloor f(x_1) \rfloor$, which means $f(x_1)$ is an integer. This implies that for any input, the output of $f$ must be an integer.

The functional expression here is $f(x_1) - \lfloor f(x_1) \rfloor$. However, the definition of functional expressions does not include the floor function. We need to construct an expression using $f$, variables, constants, $+,-,\times$.

Let's aim for an equation that forces the image of $f$ to be integers.
Consider the equation $(f(x_1) - 0)(f(x_1) - 1)(f(x_1) - (-1))(f(x_1) - 2)(f(x_1) - (-2)) \cdots = 0$.
If this product is always zero, then for any $x_1$, $f(x_1)$ must be one of the integers $0, 1, -1, 2, -2, \dots$. This implies the image of $f$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$.

However, the product is infinite, which is not allowed in a finite functional expression.

Let's consider a finite product. If we want the image of $f$ to be a specific finite set of integers, say $\{0, 1\}$, we can use the equation $f(x_1)(f(x_1) - 1) = 0$. This implies $f(x_1) = 0$ or $f(x_1) = 1$ for all $x_1$.

Consider the equation $\sin^2(\pi f(x_1)) = 0$. This holds if and only if $\pi f(x_1) = k \pi$ for some integer $k$, so $f(x_1) = k \in \mathbb{Z}$. The image of $f$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$.
However, $\sin$ is not allowed.

Let's try to construct an equation directly that implies $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Consider the expression $\sin^2(\pi y)$, where $y$ is a real number. This is zero if and only if $y$ is an integer.
We need to involve $f(x_1)$ in such a way.

Consider the equation $(f(x_1) - \lfloor f(x_1) \rfloor)^2 = 0$. This implies $f(x_1) = \lfloor f(x_1) \rfloor$, so $f(x_1)$ is an integer.

Let's use properties of functions with integer values.
If $f(x)$ is always an integer, then $\sin^2(\pi f(x)) = 0$.
Can we express something like $\sin^2(\pi y)$ using allowed operations?

Consider the equation $(f(x_1) - n)^2 = 0$, where $n$ is an integer. This implies $f(x_1) = n$.
If the equation is $(f(x_1) - c)^2 = 0$, where $c$ is a constant, then $f(x_1) = c$ for all $x_1$. The image is $\{c\}$, a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ if $c$ is an integer.

We need the image to be exactly $\mathbb{Z}$.
Consider the equation involving $f(x_1) - n$ for all integers $n$.

Let's think about the structure of the functional expression. It's a finite combination of variables, constants, $f$, $+,-,\times$.

Consider the equation $\sin(\pi f(x_1)) = 0$. This means $f(x_1)$ is an integer.

Let the functional equation be $E = 0$. If $f \in S$, then $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and $E=0$ holds for all $x_1, x_2, \dots$.
We want $S \subseteq X$, so if $f \in S$, the image of $f$ is exactly $\mathbb{Z}$.

Consider the equation $( \sin(\pi f(x_1)) )^2 + \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{1}{(f(x_1) - n)^2 + 1} = C$, where $C$ is a constant. This involves infinite sums.

Try to construct a simple equation.
If the image of $f$ is $\mathbb{Z}$, then for every integer $n$, there exists $x$ such that $f(x) = n$.

Consider the equation $\sin^2(\pi f(x_1)) = 0$. If a function $f$ satisfies this for all $x_1$, then $f(x_1) \in \mathbb{Z}$ for all $x_1$, so the image of $f$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$.

We need an equation such that the image is exactly $\mathbb{Z}$.
Consider the equation $\prod_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (f(x_1) - n) = 0$. This implies $f(x_1)$ is an integer.

Consider the equation where the solutions are functions with image $\mathbb{Z}$.
Example of a function with image $\mathbb{Z}$: $f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor$.

Let's look at the example given: $f(2f(x_1)+x_2) - 2f(x_1)-x_2 = 0$.
If $f(y) = y$, then $2f(x_1)+x_2 = 2x_1+x_2$, so $f(2x_1+x_2) - (2x_1+x_2) = 0$, which is true.
So $f(x) = x$ is a solution.
If $f(y) = y$, the image is $\mathbb{R}$.

We need an equation that forces the image to be integers.
Consider the equation $(f(x_1) - \lfloor f(x_1) \rfloor) = 0$. This is not allowed.

Try to construct an equation whose solutions are functions like $f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor$.

Consider the equation $\sin^2(\pi f(x_1)) = 0$.
If $f$ satisfies this, then $f(x_1) \in \mathbb{Z}$ for all $x_1$. The image is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$.

To ensure the image is exactly $\mathbb{Z}$, we need that for every integer $n$, there exists some input that maps to $n$.

Consider the equation $\prod_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (y - n) = 0$. This holds iff $y \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Let's try a simple case where the image is $\{0, 1\}$.
Equation $f(x_1)(f(x_1) - 1) = 0$. Solutions are functions with image $\{0\}$ or $\{1\}$ or $\{0, 1\}$.

We need an equation where the solutions have image exactly $\mathbb{Z}$.

Consider the equation $\sin^2(\pi f(x_1)) = 0$. The solutions have image $\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$.
We need to enforce that the image covers all integers.

Consider the equation: $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \min(1, (f(y_n) - n)^2) = 0$, where $y_n$ are variables. This is not a finite expression.

Let's use a different approach. We need a property that characterizes functions with image $\mathbb{Z}$.

Consider the equation $\sin^2(\pi f(x_1)) = 0$. Let $S_0$ be the set of solutions to this equation. $S_0 = \{ f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \mid \text{image}(f) \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \}$.

We need to add constraints to ensure the image is exactly $\mathbb{Z}$.
This means for every integer $n$, there exists $x$ such that $f(x) = n$.

Consider the equation $\prod_{k=-N}^{N} (f(y_k) - k)^2 = 0$. This forces the image to contain integers from $-N$ to $N$.

Let's consider the case where $S$ is nonempty.
Example: $f(x_1) = 0$. Image is $\{0\}$.
Equation $f(x_1) = 0$. Solution $f(x) = 0$. Image $\{0\} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$. Solutions have image $\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$.
We need to ensure that every integer is in the image.

Consider the equation $\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \min(1, (f(x) - n)^2) = 0$. This implies $f(x) = n$ for all $x$, so $f$ is a constant integer function.

Consider the equation:
$(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \text{something related to } (f(y_n) - n)$.

Let's simplify the problem. We need a functional equation such that its solutions have image exactly $\mathbb{Z}$.

Consider the equation $\prod_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \sin^2(\pi (f(x_n) - n)) = 0$.
If this holds, then for some $n$, $\sin(\pi (f(x_n) - n)) = 0$, so $f(x_n) - n$ is an integer.

Consider the equation $\prod_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (f(y_n) - n)^2 = 0$.

Let's try a concrete example of a function in $X$. $f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor$.
We need an equation that $\lfloor x \rfloor$ satisfies.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$.
Solutions have image subset of $\mathbb{Z}$.

We need to ensure that all integers are attained.

Consider the equation $\prod_{n=-N}^{N} (f(y_n) - n)^2 = 0$, where $y_n$ are distinct variables.
This implies that for each $n \in [-N, N]$, there exists some value where $f$ takes the value $n$.

Let the functional equation be $E = 0$. If $f \in S$, then image($f$) = $\mathbb{Z}$.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$.
Solutions have image contained in $\mathbb{Z}$.

We need to force that for every integer $n$, there exists $x$ such that $f(x) = n$.

Consider the equation $\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (1 - \cos(2 \pi (f(y_n) - n))) = 0$.
This implies $\cos(2 \pi (f(y_n) - n)) = 1$, so $f(y_n) - n$ is an integer.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} ( \sin^2(\pi (f(y_n) - n)) ) = 0$.
This implies $\sin(\pi f(x_1)) = 0$ and $\sin(\pi (f(y_n) - n)) = 0$ for all $n$.
So $f(x_1) \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $f(y_n) - n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$. Solutions have image $\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$.
Nonempty set of solutions: $f(x) = 0$.

To ensure the image is exactly $\mathbb{Z}$, we need to force that every integer is reached.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \prod_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \text{something}$.

Let's go back to the definition of functional expression.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$.
If $f$ is a solution, then $f(x_1) \in \mathbb{Z}$ for all $x_1$. Image is subset of $\mathbb{Z}$.
Example solution: $f(x) = 0$. Image $\{0\}$.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} ( \min(1, (f(y_n) - n)^2) ) = 0$.

Let the functional equation be $E = 0$.
If $f \in S$, then image($f$) = $\mathbb{Z}$.

Consider the equation:
$(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \sum_{n=-N}^{N} (f(y_n) - n)^2 = 0$.
This implies $f(x_1) \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $f(y_n) = n$ for $n = -N, \dots, N$.
The image contains integers from $-N$ to $N$.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (f(y_n) - n)^2 = 0$.
This is not a finite expression.

Try a different approach. Consider a function $f$ with image $\mathbb{Z}$.
Example: $f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor$.

Consider the equation $f(x_1) - \lfloor f(x_1) \rfloor = 0$.

Consider the equation $\prod_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (f(y) - n)^2 = 0$.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$.
Solutions are functions with image $\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$.
Example solution: $f(x) = 0$. Image $\{0\}$.

We need to construct a functional equation $E=0$ such that the solutions have image exactly $\mathbb{Z}$.

Consider the equation:
$(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \prod_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} ( (f(y_n) - n)^2 + 1 )^{-1} = 1$.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$.
$S = \{ f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \mid \text{image}(f) \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \}$.
$S$ is nonempty (e.g., $f(x) = 0$).
$S \subseteq X$ is false, since functions with image $\{0\}$ are in $S$, but not in $X$.

Let's modify the equation.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \delta_{f(y_n), n} = \text{constant}$.

Let the equation be $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$. $S$ is nonempty, $S$ contains functions with image $\{0\}$.

Consider the equation $\prod_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (f(y_n) - n)^2 = 0$.

Consider the equation:
$(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (1 - \cos(2 \pi (f(y_n) - n))) = 0$.
This is not a finite sum.

Let's try a simpler problem: image is $\{0, 1\}$.
Equation $f(x_1)(f(x_1) - 1) = 0$.
Solutions have image $\subseteq \{0, 1\}$.
To enforce image is exactly $\{0, 1\}$, we need values $y_0, y_1$ such that $f(y_0) = 0, f(y_1) = 1$.
Equation: $f(x_1)(f(x_1) - 1) + (f(y_0)^2) + ((f(y_1) - 1)^2) = 0$.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \sum_{n=-N}^{N} (f(y_n) - n)^2 = 0$.
Solutions have image containing integers from $-N$ to $N$.

Let the functional equation be:
$(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (f(y_n) - n)^2 \cdot g_n(f(y_n))$, where $g_n$ ensures the terms are relevant.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \min(1, (f(y_n) - n)^2) = 0$.

Consider the equation:
$(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \min(1, (f(y_n) - n)^2) = 0$.
This implies $f(x_1) \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $f(y_n) = n$ for all $n$.
Image is $\mathbb{Z}$. But the sum is infinite.

Try a finite expression.

Equation: $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \prod_{n=-N}^{N} (f(y_n) - n)^2 = 0$.
This implies $f(x_1) \in \mathbb{Z}$ and for each $n \in [-N, N]$, $f(y_n) = n$.
Solutions have image containing integers from $-N$ to $N$.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$.
$S = \{ f \mid \text{image}(f) \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \}$.
Nonempty, $f(x) = 0 \in S$.
If $f \in S$, image is subset of $\mathbb{Z}$.

Part (a): Equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$.
$S = \{ f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \mid \forall x_1, f(x_1) \in \mathbb{Z} \}$.
$S$ is nonempty (e.g., $f(x) = 0$).
If $f \in S$, then image($f$) $\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$.

Consider the equation:
$(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \prod_{n=-N}^{N} (f(y_n) - n)^2 = 0$.
Solutions have image containing $\{-N, \dots, N\}$ and contained in $\mathbb{Z}$.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$.
Solutions have image $\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$.
Example: $f(x) = 0$. Image $\{0\}$.
Example: $f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor$. Image $\mathbb{Z}$.

Consider the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$.
$S = \{ f \mid \text{image}(f) \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \}$.
Take a function $f$ with image exactly $\mathbb{Z}$. Then $f \in S$.
So $S$ is nonempty.
If $f \in S$, then image($f$) $\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$.
We need $S \subseteq X$, so image($f$) is exactly $\mathbb{Z}$.

Part (a): Choose the equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$.
Then $S = \{ f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \mid \text{image}(f) \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \}$.
$S$ is nonempty (e.g., $f(x) = 0$).
However, $S \not\subseteq X$, since $f(x) = 0 \in S$, but image is $\{0\} \neq \mathbb{Z}$.

Try equation: $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (f(y_n) - n)^2 = 0$.

Consider equation: $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$.
$S = \{ f \mid \text{image}(f) \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \}$.
To ensure image is exactly $\mathbb{Z}$, we need that for every integer $n$, there exists $x$ such that $f(x) = n$.

Part (b): Can Carl choose his functional equation such that $|S|=1$ and $S \subseteq X$?
If $|S|=1$ and $S \subseteq X$, then $S = \{f\}$ where image($f$) = $\mathbb{Z}$.
We need a unique solution with image $\mathbb{Z}$.

Consider the equation $f(x_1) = \lfloor x_1 \rfloor$.
Equation $f(x_1) - \lfloor x_1 \rfloor = 0$. Not allowed.

Consider the equation $(f(x_1) - \lfloor x_1 \rfloor)^2 = 0$.

Final thoughts on part (a):
Equation $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 = 0$.
$S = \{ f \mid \text{image}(f) \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \}$. Nonempty, $f(x) = 0$.
If we need $S \subseteq X$, consider functions in $S$.

<text>Consider the equation $(f(x_1) - n)^2 = 0$, where $n$ is an integer. This implies $f(x_1) = n$.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies basic algebraic knowledge that if a squared term equals zero, then the term itself must equal zero, using this to construct constraints on the function.</explanation>

<start>4327</start>
<end>4390</end>
<text>We need an equation that forces the image to be integers.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes the need to apply mathematical knowledge to construct an equation with specific properties regarding the image of functions that satisfy it.</explanation>

<start>9271</start>
<end>9455</end>
<text>Consider the equation:
$(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \prod_{n=-N}^{N} (f(y_n) - n)^2 = 0$.
This implies $f(x_1) \in \mathbb{Z}$ and for each $n \in [-N, N]$, $f(y_n) = n$.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies knowledge of when trigonometric expressions equal zero and when squared terms equal zero to analyze the implications of a proposed equation for the properties of functions that satisfy it.</explanation>

<skill>Iterative Refinement</skill>
<definition>The ability to progressively improve a solution by repeatedly modifying and testing it, addressing identified issues or limitations.</definition>

<start>938</start>
<end>1043</end>
<text>Let's aim for an equation that forces the image of $f$ to be integers.</text>
<explanation>After recognizing constraints, the solver adjusts the approach, focusing on the core requirement that the function's image consists of integers.</explanation>

<start>1043</start>
<end>1252</end>
<text>Consider the equation $(f(x_1) - 0)(f(x_1) - 1)(f(x_1) - (-1))(f(x_1) - 2)(f(x_1) - (-2)) \cdots = 0$.
If this product is always zero, then for any $x_1$, $f(x_1)$ must be one of the integers $0, 1, -1, 2, -2, \dots$. This implies the image of $f$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver proposes a new approach after recognizing the floor function isn't allowed, iteratively refining the solution strategy.</explanation>

<start>2516</start>
<end>2593</end>
<text>If the equation is $(f(x_1) - c)^2 = 0$, where $c$ is a constant, then $f(x_1) = c$ for all $x_1$.</text>
<explanation>The solver refines the previous hypothesis by considering a more general case with a constant c instead of an integer n, showing iterative refinement of the mathematical approach.</explanation>

<start>8983</start>
<end>9026</end>
<text>Let's modify the equation.</text>
<explanation>After evaluating a proposed equation and finding it doesn't meet all requirements, the solver explicitly states the intention to refine the approach.</explanation>

<start>9455</start>
<end>9552</end>
<text>Solutions have image containing integers from $-N$ to $N$.</text>
<explanation>The solver refines the understanding of what the proposed equation accomplishes, recognizing it constrains the image to include a finite range of integers rather than all integers.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Planning</skill>
<definition>The ability to develop a systematic approach to solving a problem, breaking it down into manageable steps and identifying key subgoals.</definition>

<start>4390</start>
<end>4493</end>
<text>Consider the equation $(f(x_1) - \lfloor f(x_1) \rfloor) = 0$. This is not allowed.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that a direct approach isn't allowed by the problem constraints and implicitly begins planning an alternative strategy.</explanation>

<start>4493</start>
<end>4578</end>
<text>Try to construct an equation whose solutions are functions like $f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor$.</text>
<explanation>The solver establishes a strategic goal of finding an equation that would have the floor function as a solution, showing planning around a specific target function.</explanation>

<start>4579</start>
<end>4689</end>
<text>Consider the equation $\sin^2(\pi f(x_1)) = 0$.
If $f$ satisfies this, then $f(x_1) \in \mathbb{Z}$ for all $x_1$.</text>
<explanation>The solver proposes a specific equation as part of the strategy to constrain the function's outputs to integers.</explanation>

<start>4689</start>
<end>4798</end>
<text>The image is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$.
To ensure the image is exactly $\mathbb{Z}$, we need that for every integer $n$, there exists some input that maps to $n$.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies a key subgoal: not only must the function's outputs be integers, but every integer must be in the image of the function.</explanation>

<start>10795</start>
<end>10879</end>
<text>Try equation: $(\sin(\pi f(x_1)))^2 + \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (f(y_n) - n)^2 = 0$.</text>
<explanation>After identifying limitations in the previous approach, the solver strategically proposes a new equation that might address both requirements simultaneously.</explanation>
