Problem:
e. Calculate the projected physical separation, $r_{p}$, between the galaxy and the Voorwerp.g. High precision measurements showed that the Voorwerp is slightly further away than the galaxy, and so $\theta=125^{\circ}$. Use this with your expression from the previous part of the question to estimate an upper limit for the number of years that have passed since the quasar was last active.

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Here's a breakdown of the thinking process to arrive at the solution:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The overall goal is to estimate an upper limit on the time since the quasar was last active. This involves calculating the projected separation and then using the angle information and the speed of light to find the travel time of the light.

2. **Analyze Part (e):  Calculate Projected Separation**

   * **Recall the formula:** The projected physical separation formula is given as  `rp = D * tan(θ)`.
   * **Identify knowns:** From previous parts, we know `D` (the distance to the galaxy/quasar) and `θ` (the angular separation).
   * **Plug in values:** Substitute the numerical values into the formula.
   * **Calculate:** Perform the calculation, paying attention to units (kpc).

3. **Analyze Part (g): Estimate Time Since Quasar's Last Activity**

   * **Key Insight:** The Voorwerp is illuminated by light from the quasar. Since the Voorwerp is further away, the light we currently see from it originated *some time ago* when the quasar was active. The difference in distance is crucial.
   * **Visual Representation:**  Imagine a triangle:
      * One vertex is the observer on Earth.
      * Another vertex is the galaxy/quasar.
      * The third vertex is the Voorwerp.
   * **Relate Angle to Distance Difference:** The angle `θ` (125 degrees) *between the line of sight to the galaxy and the line of sight to the Voorwerp* is important. However, we need to be careful: this isn't the same `θ` as in part (e). The problem states this is a *new* high-precision measurement. This new `θ` is related to the *geometry* of the situation, particularly the small difference in distance.
   * **Consider the Light Path:** The light traveled from the quasar to the Voorwerp. The *extra distance* the light traveled to reach the Voorwerp compared to reaching the galaxy is what determines the time difference.
   * **Approximation:** Since the separation is small compared to the distance to the galaxy, we can approximate the extra distance the light traveled. Think about the geometry. The projected separation `rp` we calculated in part (e) is a reasonable approximation for this extra distance. *Self-correction:* Initially, I might think about using trigonometry with the new angle, but since the problem asks for an *upper limit*, and the projected separation is a reasonable estimate of the *shortest* distance between the galaxy and the Voorwerp *at the time the light was emitted*, using this value will provide a valid (though potentially slightly over-) estimate of the light travel time.
   * **Relate Distance and Time:** Use the fundamental relationship: `distance = speed × time`. We know the speed of light (`c`). We have an estimate for the extra distance (`rp`). Therefore, we can solve for the time.
   * **Units:** Ensure consistent units. `rp` is in kpc, and `c` is typically in km/s. Convert kpc to km. The resulting time will be in seconds.
   * **Convert to Years:** The question asks for the answer in years. Convert seconds to years.
   * **Address the "Upper Limit":** The approximation we used (projected separation) inherently provides an upper limit because it assumes the light traveled the shortest path between the galaxy's position and the Voorwerp's position *at the time of emission*. Any deviation from a straight line or any movement of the Voorwerp would increase the actual light travel time.

4. **Structure the Answer:**  Present the calculations clearly, step-by-step, labeling each part and showing the units. Explain the reasoning behind the approach, especially for part (g) and why it provides an upper limit.

**Self-Correction Example During Thinking:**

*Initial thought:* In part (g), should I use the new angle `θ = 125°` directly in a trigonometric calculation with the distance `D`?

*Correction:*  The problem states the Voorwerp is *slightly further away*. The `125°` angle describes the viewing angle *from Earth*. It doesn't directly give the physical separation at the time of emission. The *projected* separation we calculated earlier is a better proxy for the extra distance the light traveled. Using the projected separation is a more straightforward way to estimate the time and aligns with the idea of finding an *upper limit*. Using more complex trigonometry with the 125-degree angle would require knowing more about the precise geometry and could potentially lead to a more accurate, but not necessarily simpler, estimate. Since the question asks for an *upper limit*, the projected separation provides a conservative estimate.
