<skill>Problem Interpretation</skill>
<definition>The ability to understand and decode the problem statement, identifying key variables, constraints, and the goal of the problem.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>230</end>
<text>230</text>
<explanation>This is an interesting case where the solver has provided only the final answer (230) without showing their work. This suggests they understood the problem's goal was to find the value of m+n where z = m+√n+11i is a vertex of a right triangle with f(z) and f(f(z)). Even without seeing the work, we can infer they correctly interpreted what needed to be calculated.</explanation>

<skill>Complex Number Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to work with complex numbers, including performing operations and understanding their geometric representation in the complex plane.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>230</end>
<text>230</text>
<explanation>The problem involves working with complex numbers and their geometric interpretation as points in the complex plane. The solver would have needed to work with the complex number z = m+√n+11i, calculate f(z) and f(f(z)), and understand how these three points form a right triangle. The fact that they arrived at the correct answer suggests they successfully manipulated complex numbers.</explanation>

<skill>Function Evaluation</skill>
<definition>The ability to substitute values into functions and evaluate the resulting expressions.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>230</end>
<text>230</text>
<explanation>To solve this problem, the solver would have needed to evaluate f(z) = z²-19z when z = m+√n+11i, and then evaluate f(f(z)) by substituting the result back into the function. The correct answer indicates they properly evaluated these functions.</explanation>

<skill>Geometric Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to understand and apply geometric principles, particularly related to triangles and the Pythagorean theorem in this case.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>230</end>
<text>230</text>
<explanation>The problem requires understanding that three points form a right triangle with a right angle at f(z). This means applying the Pythagorean theorem or using the fact that two sides of the triangle are perpendicular. The solver would have used this geometric principle to set up equations that led to the correct answer of 230.</explanation>

<skill>Constraint Satisfaction</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and satisfy multiple constraints simultaneously, finding values that meet all required conditions.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>230</end>
<text>230</text>
<explanation>The problem has multiple constraints: z must be in the form m+√n+11i where m and n are positive integers, and z, f(z), and f(f(z)) must form a right triangle with the right angle at f(z). The solver successfully found values of m and n that satisfy all these constraints, resulting in m+n = 230.</explanation>

<skill>Equation Solving</skill>
<definition>The ability to set up and solve equations or systems of equations to find unknown values.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>230</end>
<text>230</text>
<explanation>To find the values of m and n, the solver would have needed to set up equations based on the right triangle condition and solve them. The fact that they arrived at the correct sum m+n = 230 indicates they successfully solved these equations.</explanation>
