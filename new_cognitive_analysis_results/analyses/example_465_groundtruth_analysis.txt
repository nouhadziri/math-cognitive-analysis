Problem:
You are given integrable random variables \( X, Y_0 \) and \( Z_0 \) on the same probability space \( (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P}) \), and two \( \sigma \)-algebras \( \mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{F}. \) For \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, \), let \[ Y_k := \mathbb{E}[X|\sigma(\mathcal{A}, Z_0, \ldots, Z_{k-1})] , \quad Z_k := \mathbb{E}[X|\sigma(\mathcal{B}, Y_0, \ldots, Y_{k-1})] . \] (a) Show that there exist integrable random variables \( Y_\infty \) and \( Z_\infty \) such that as \( n \to \infty \) both \( \mathbb{E}[|Y_n - Y_\infty|] \to 0 \) and \( \mathbb{E}[|Z_n - Z_\infty|] \to 0 \). (b) Prove that almost surely \( Y_\infty = Z_\infty. \)

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]\item Introduce the notations, $\mathcal{F}_n:=\sigma(\mathcal{A},Z_0, \ldots, Z_{n-1})$ and $\mathcal{G}_n:=\sigma(\mathcal{B},Y_0, \ldots, Y_{n-1})$, for all $n \geq 1$ and $\mathcal{F}_0:=\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{G}_0:=\mathcal{B}$. Clearly, both are filtrations and by definition,  $Y_n=\mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{F}_n \right]$ and $Z_n=\mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right]$, for all $n \geq 0$. Thus $\left\{Y_n\right\}_{n \geq 0}$ (or $\left\{Z_n\right\}_{n \geq 0}$ ) is a \textit{Doob's Martingale} with respect to filtration $\left\{\mathcal{F}_n\right\}_{n \geq 0}$ (or $\left\{\mathcal{G}_n\right\}_{n \geq 0}$) and hence is U.I., $X$ being integrable. (see \cite[Proposition 4.2.33]{dembo}). Now apply the fact that a Martingale is U.I. if and only if it converges in $L^1$ (see \cite[Proposition 5.3.12]{dembo}) and conclude. \item We provide two different proofs. \begin{enumerate}[label=(1)] \item Observe the following identity which follows from \textit{Tower Property}. \begin{equation}{\label{tower}} \mathbb{E} \left[Y_n \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ \mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{F}_n \right] \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ \mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] \rvert \mathcal{F}_n \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[Z_n \rvert \mathcal{F}_n \right].\end{equation} Note that $\mathbb{E}\rvert \mathbb{E} \left[Y_n \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] - \mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right]\rvert \leq \mathbb{E} |Y_n - Y_{\infty}| =o(1)$ and by \textit{Levy's Upward Theorem}, $\mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] \stackrel{L^1}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \right]$, where $\mathcal{G}_{\infty} = \sigma \left( \cup_{n \geq 0} \mathcal{G}_n\right) = \sigma(\mathcal{B},Y_0,Y_1 \ldots).$ It is evident that $Y_{\infty} \in m\mathcal{G}_{\infty}$ (since it is almost sure limit of $Y_n \in m\mathcal{G}_n$) and hence $\mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \right]=Y_{\infty}$ almost surely. Combining the above observations we conclude that $\mathbb{E} \left[Y_n \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] \stackrel{L^1}{\longrightarrow} Y_{\infty}.$ Similarly, $\mathbb{E} \left[Z_n \rvert \mathcal{F}_n \right] \stackrel{L^1}{\longrightarrow} Z_{\infty}.$ Now invoke Equation~({\ref{tower}}), to conclude that $Y_{\infty}=Z_{\infty}$ almost surely. \item Since $X$ is integrable, we have by \textit{Levy's Upward Theorem}, $Y_{\infty}= \lim_{n \to \infty} Y_n = \lim_{n \to \infty}\mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{F}_n \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{F}_{\infty} \right].$ Similarly, $Z_{\infty} = \mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \right].$ On the otherhand, in first proof we have observed that $Y_{\infty} \in m\mathcal{G}_{\infty}$ and hence $Y_{\infty} \in m\mathcal{G}_{\infty} \cap m\mathcal{F}_{\infty} = m\left(\mathcal{G}_{\infty} \cap \mathcal{F}_{\infty}\right)$. This yields the following. $$ Y_{\infty} =  \mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \cap \mathcal{F}_{\infty} \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ \mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{F}_{\infty} \right]\rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \cap \mathcal{F}_{\infty} \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[X\rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \cap \mathcal{F}_{\infty} \right]. $$ Similarly, $Z_{\infty} = \mathbb{E} \left[X\rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \cap \mathcal{F}_{\infty} \right].$ This proves that $Y_{\infty}=Z_{\infty}$ almost surely. \end{enumerate} \end{enumerate}

<text>Introduce the notations, $\mathcal{F}_n:=\sigma(\mathcal{A},Z_0, \ldots, Z_{n-1})$ and $\mathcal{G}_n:=\sigma(\mathcal{B},Y_0, \ldots, Y_{n-1})$, for all $n \geq 1$ and $\mathcal{F}_0:=\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{G}_0:=\mathcal{B}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver introduces new notation that reformulates the problem in terms of filtrations. This abstraction simplifies the subsequent analysis by creating a cleaner mathematical framework to work with. By defining these sigma-algebras as sequences, the solver transforms the problem into a more standard form in probability theory.</explanation>

<start>214</start>

<text>Clearly, both are filtrations and by definition, $Y_n=\mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{F}_n \right]$ and $Z_n=\mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right]$, for all $n \geq 0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver further reformulates the problem by rewriting the given expressions for Y_k and Z_k in terms of the newly defined filtrations. This abstraction makes the problem more tractable by connecting it to the well-established theory of martingales.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver recognizes that the sequences of random variables form Doob's martingales, a specific pattern in probability theory. This recognition allows them to apply known theoretical results about martingales to solve the problem. The solver also identifies that the martingales are uniformly integrable (U.I.), which is crucial for the convergence argument.</explanation>

<start>1181</start>
<end>1338</end>
<text>and by \textit{Levy's Upward Theorem}, $\mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] \stackrel{L^1}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \right]$</text>
<explanation>The solver applies Levy's Upward Theorem, a specific result from measure theory, to analyze the convergence behavior. This shows recognition of when a particular theoretical result is applicable to the problem structure.</explanation>

<start>1882</start>
<end>2057</end>
<text>Since $X$ is integrable, we have by \textit{Levy's Upward Theorem}, $Y_{\infty}= \lim_{n \to \infty} Y_n = \lim_{n \to \infty}\mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{F}_n \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{F}_{\infty} \right].$</text>

<explanation>The solver constructs a logical chain of equalities using the Tower Property of conditional expectation. Each step in this chain follows logically from the previous one, demonstrating precise deductive reasoning in probability theory.</explanation>

<start>1000</start>
<end>1181</end>
<text>Note that $\mathbb{E}\rvert \mathbb{E} \left[Y_n \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] - \mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right]\rvert \leq \mathbb{E} |Y_n - Y_{\infty}| =o(1)$</text>
<explanation>The solver applies properties of conditional expectation to establish an inequality, demonstrating logical deduction by connecting the convergence of Y_n to Y_â with the convergence of their conditional expectations.</explanation>

<start>1338</start>
<end>1464</end>
<text>, where $\mathcal{G}_{\infty} = \sigma \left( \cup_{n \geq 0} \mathcal{G}_n\right) = \sigma(\mathcal{B},Y_0,Y_1 \ldots).$ It is evident that $Y_{\infty} \in m\mathcal{G}_{\infty}$</text>
<explanation>The solver deduces that Y_â is measurable with respect to G_â based on the fact that it's the limit of random variables measurable with respect to G_n. This shows logical inference about measurability properties.</explanation>

<start>1464</start>
<end>1570</end>
<text>(since it is almost sure limit of $Y_n \in m\mathcal{G}_n$) and hence $\mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \right]=Y_{\infty}$ almost surely.</text>
