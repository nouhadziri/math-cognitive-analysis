Problem:
You are given integrable random variables \( X, Y_0 \) and \( Z_0 \) on the same probability space \( (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P}) \), and two \( \sigma \)-algebras \( \mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{F}. \) For \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, \), let \[ Y_k := \mathbb{E}[X|\sigma(\mathcal{A}, Z_0, \ldots, Z_{k-1})] , \quad Z_k := \mathbb{E}[X|\sigma(\mathcal{B}, Y_0, \ldots, Y_{k-1})] . \] (a) Show that there exist integrable random variables \( Y_\infty \) and \( Z_\infty \) such that as \( n \to \infty \) both \( \mathbb{E}[|Y_n - Y_\infty|] \to 0 \) and \( \mathbb{E}[|Z_n - Z_\infty|] \to 0 \). (b) Prove that almost surely \( Y_\infty = Z_\infty. \)

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]\item Introduce the notations, $\mathcal{F}_n:=\sigma(\mathcal{A},Z_0, \ldots, Z_{n-1})$ and $\mathcal{G}_n:=\sigma(\mathcal{B},Y_0, \ldots, Y_{n-1})$, for all $n \geq 1$ and $\mathcal{F}_0:=\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{G}_0:=\mathcal{B}$. Clearly, both are filtrations and by definition,  $Y_n=\mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{F}_n \right]$ and $Z_n=\mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right]$, for all $n \geq 0$. Thus $\left\{Y_n\right\}_{n \geq 0}$ (or $\left\{Z_n\right\}_{n \geq 0}$ ) is a \textit{Doob's Martingale} with respect to filtration $\left\{\mathcal{F}_n\right\}_{n \geq 0}$ (or $\left\{\mathcal{G}_n\right\}_{n \geq 0}$) and hence is U.I., $X$ being integrable. (see \cite[Proposition 4.2.33]{dembo}). Now apply the fact that a Martingale is U.I. if and only if it converges in $L^1$ (see \cite[Proposition 5.3.12]{dembo}) and conclude. \item We provide two different proofs. \begin{enumerate}[label=(1)] \item Observe the following identity which follows from \textit{Tower Property}. \begin{equation}{\label{tower}} \mathbb{E} \left[Y_n \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ \mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{F}_n \right] \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ \mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] \rvert \mathcal{F}_n \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[Z_n \rvert \mathcal{F}_n \right].\end{equation} Note that $\mathbb{E}\rvert \mathbb{E} \left[Y_n \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] - \mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right]\rvert \leq \mathbb{E} |Y_n - Y_{\infty}| =o(1)$ and by \textit{Levy's Upward Theorem}, $\mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] \stackrel{L^1}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \right]$, where $\mathcal{G}_{\infty} = \sigma \left( \cup_{n \geq 0} \mathcal{G}_n\right) = \sigma(\mathcal{B},Y_0,Y_1 \ldots).$ It is evident that $Y_{\infty} \in m\mathcal{G}_{\infty}$ (since it is almost sure limit of $Y_n \in m\mathcal{G}_n$) and hence $\mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \right]=Y_{\infty}$ almost surely. Combining the above observations we conclude that $\mathbb{E} \left[Y_n \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] \stackrel{L^1}{\longrightarrow} Y_{\infty}.$ Similarly, $\mathbb{E} \left[Z_n \rvert \mathcal{F}_n \right] \stackrel{L^1}{\longrightarrow} Z_{\infty}.$ Now invoke Equation~({\ref{tower}}), to conclude that $Y_{\infty}=Z_{\infty}$ almost surely. \item Since $X$ is integrable, we have by \textit{Levy's Upward Theorem}, $Y_{\infty}= \lim_{n \to \infty} Y_n = \lim_{n \to \infty}\mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{F}_n \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{F}_{\infty} \right].$ Similarly, $Z_{\infty} = \mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \right].$ On the otherhand, in first proof we have observed that $Y_{\infty} \in m\mathcal{G}_{\infty}$ and hence $Y_{\infty} \in m\mathcal{G}_{\infty} \cap m\mathcal{F}_{\infty} = m\left(\mathcal{G}_{\infty} \cap \mathcal{F}_{\infty}\right)$. This yields the following. $$ Y_{\infty} =  \mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \cap \mathcal{F}_{\infty} \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ \mathbb{E} \left[X \rvert \mathcal{F}_{\infty} \right]\rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \cap \mathcal{F}_{\infty} \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[X\rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \cap \mathcal{F}_{\infty} \right]. $$ Similarly, $Z_{\infty} = \mathbb{E} \left[X\rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \cap \mathcal{F}_{\infty} \right].$ This proves that $Y_{\infty}=Z_{\infty}$ almost surely. \end{enumerate} \end{enumerate}

<explanation>The solver constructs a logical chain of equalities using the Tower Property of conditional expectation. Each step in this chain follows logically from the previous one, demonstrating precise deductive reasoning in probability theory.</explanation>

<start>1000</start>
<end>1181</end>
<text>Note that $\mathbb{E}\rvert \mathbb{E} \left[Y_n \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right] - \mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_n \right]\rvert \leq \mathbb{E} |Y_n - Y_{\infty}| =o(1)$</text>
<explanation>The solver applies properties of conditional expectation to establish an inequality, demonstrating logical deduction by connecting the convergence of Y_n to Y_∞ with the convergence of their conditional expectations.</explanation>

<start>1338</start>
<end>1464</end>
<text>, where $\mathcal{G}_{\infty} = \sigma \left( \cup_{n \geq 0} \mathcal{G}_n\right) = \sigma(\mathcal{B},Y_0,Y_1 \ldots).$ It is evident that $Y_{\infty} \in m\mathcal{G}_{\infty}$</text>
<explanation>The solver deduces that Y_∞ is measurable with respect to G_∞ based on the fact that it's the limit of random variables measurable with respect to G_n. This shows logical inference about measurability properties.</explanation>

<start>1464</start>
<end>1570</end>
<text>(since it is almost sure limit of $Y_n \in m\mathcal{G}_n$) and hence $\mathbb{E} \left[Y_{\infty} \rvert \mathcal{G}_{\infty} \right]=Y_{\infty}$ almost surely.</text>
