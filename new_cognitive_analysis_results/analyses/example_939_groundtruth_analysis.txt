Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
### Part (a): Prove that \( |F| = \infty \)

1. **Partition the set \( \mathbb{Z} \times S \) into \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \)**:
   - Define \( S_1 = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{Z} \times S \mid x + y \text{ is even}\} \)
   - Define \( S_2 = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{Z} \times S \mid x + y \text{ is odd}\} \)

2. **Construct a function \( g: S_1 \to [0,1] \)**:
   - For any \( x \in \mathbb{Z} \), let \( g(x+1, 1) = a_1, g(x+3, 1) = a_2, \ldots, g(x+4n+1, 1) = a_{2n+1} \)
   - Ensure that \( g(x, 0) = g(x, 2n+1) = 0 \) for all \( (x, 0), (x, 2n+1) \in S_1 \)

3. **Satisfy the condition \( g(x-1, y) + g(x+1, y) + g(x, y-1) + g(x, y+1) = 1 \)**:
   - For \( y = 1 \), we have \( g(x+2n+1, 2n+1) = \sum_{i=1}^{2n+1} a_i - n = 0 \)
   - This implies \( \sum_{i=1}^{2n+1} a_i = n \)

4. **Determine the values of \( g \) in terms of \( a_i \)**:
   - Observe that \( g(x, y) \in \bigcup_{i=1}^{2n+1} \{ a_i, 1 - a_i - a_{i+1}, a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} - 1, \ldots, n - a_i - a_{i+1} - \ldots - a_{2n-1}, a_i + a_{i+1} + \ldots + a_{2n} - n \} \)

5. **Construct infinitely many functions \( g \)**:
   - Choose \( a_i \sim \frac{n}{2n+1} \) for all \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, 2n+1 \) such that \( \sum_{i=1}^{2n+1} a_i = n \)
   - This ensures \( g(x, y) \in [0, 1] \) for every \( (x, y) \in S_1 \)

6. **Conclusion**:
   - There exist infinitely many functions \( g \), hence \( |F| = \infty \)

### Part (b): Prove that for each \( f \in F \), \( |v(f)| < \infty \)

1. **Finite values of \( g \)**:
   - Since \( v(g: S_1 \to [0,1]) = \{ g(x, y) \mid (x, y) \in S_1 \} \) is finite, so is \( v(g: S_2 \to [0,1]) \)

2. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, \( |v(f)| \) is finite for each \( f \in F \)

### Part (c): Find the maximum value of \( |v(f)| \) for \( f \in F \)

1. **Union of values**:
   - Note that \( v(f) = v(g: S_1 \to [0,1]) \cup v(g: S_2 \to [0,1]) \)

2. **Determine the maximum value**:
   - Since \( g(x, y) \in \bigcup_{i=1}^{2n+1} \{ a_i, 1 - a_i - a_{i+1}, a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} - 1, \ldots, n - a_i - a_{i+1} - \ldots - a_{2n-1}, a_i + a_{i+1} + \ldots + a_{2n} - n \} \)
   - Plug in \( a_{2n+1} = n - a_1 - a_2 - \ldots - a_{2n} \) and consider \( a_i \) for all \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, 2n \) such that \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} \) are linearly independent basis \( \sim \frac{n}{(2n+1)} \)

3. **Maximum value**:
   - The maximum value of \( |v(f)| \) is \( 2n + 1 \)

The final answer is \( \boxed{ 2n + 1 } \)
