Problem:
The sequences of real numbers $\left\{a_{i}\right\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ and $\left\{b_{i}\right\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ satisfy $a_{n+1}=\left(a_{n-1}-1\right)\left(b_{n}+1\right)$ and $b_{n+1}=a_{n} b_{n-1}-1$ for $n \geq 2$, with $a_{1}=a_{2}=2015$ and $b_{1}=b_{2}=2013$. Evaluate, with proof, the infinite sum $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n}\left(\frac{1}{a_{n+1}}-\frac{1}{a_{n+3}}\right)$.

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
First note that $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$ are weakly increasing and tend to infinity. In particular, $a_{n}, b_{n} \notin\{0,-1,1\}$ for all $n$. For $n \geq 1$, we have $a_{n+3}=\left(a_{n+1}-1\right)\left(b_{n+2}+1\right)=\left(a_{n+1}-1\right)\left(a_{n+1} b_{n}\right)$, so $\frac{b_{n}}{a_{n+3}}=\frac{1}{a_{n+1}\left(a_{n+1}-1\right)}=\frac{1}{a_{n+1}-1}-\frac{1}{a_{n+1}}$. Therefore, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_{n}}{a_{n+1}}-\frac{b_{n}}{a_{n+3}} =\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_{n}}{a_{n+1}}-\left(\frac{1}{a_{n+1}-1}-\frac{1}{a_{n+1}}\right) =\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_{n}+1}{a_{n+1}}-\frac{1}{a_{n+1}-1}$. Furthermore, $b_{n}+1=\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n-1}-1}$ for $n \geq 2$. So the sum over $n \geq 2$ is $\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{a_{n-1}-1}-\frac{1}{a_{n+1}-1}\right) =\lim _{N \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=2}^{N}\left(\frac{1}{a_{n-1}-1}-\frac{1}{a_{n+1}-1}\right) =\frac{1}{a_{1}-1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}-1}-\lim _{N \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{1}{a_{N}-1}+\frac{1}{a_{N+1}-1}\right) =\frac{1}{a_{1}-1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}-1}$. Hence the final answer is $\left(\frac{b_{1}+1}{a_{2}}-\frac{1}{a_{2}-1}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{a_{1}-1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}-1}\right)$. Cancelling the common terms and putting in our starting values, this equals $\frac{2014}{2015}+\frac{1}{2014}=1-\frac{1}{2015}+\frac{1}{2014}=1+\frac{1}{2014 \cdot 2015}$

<text>First note that $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$ are weakly increasing and tend to infinity. In particular, $a_{n}, b_{n} \notin\{0,-1,1\}$ for all $n$. For $n \geq 1$, we have $a_{n+3}=\left(a_{n+1}-1\right)\left(b_{n+2}+1\right)=\left(a_{n+1}-1\right)\left(a_{n+1} b_{n}\right)$</text>
<explanation>The solver begins by recognizing important patterns in the sequences. They identify growth properties (weakly increasing and tending to infinity) and specific excluded values. Then they manipulate the recurrence relations to find a connection between $a_{n+3}$ and earlier terms, revealing a pattern that will be crucial for solving the problem.</explanation>

<start>190</start>
<end>282</end>
<text>so $\frac{b_{n}}{a_{n+3}}=\frac{1}{a_{n+1}\left(a_{n+1}-1\right)}=\frac{1}{a_{n+1}-1}-\frac{1}{a_{n+1}}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes a key pattern in the relationship between terms that allows them to express the ratio $\frac{b_{n}}{a_{n+3}}$ in terms of $a_{n+1}$, which is critical for manipulating the sum.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to transform mathematical expressions by applying valid operations to simplify, expand, factor, or rewrite them in more useful forms.</definition>

<start>190</start>
<end>282</end>
<text>so $\frac{b_{n}}{a_{n+3}}=\frac{1}{a_{n+1}\left(a_{n+1}-1\right)}=\frac{1}{a_{n+1}-1}-\frac{1}{a_{n+1}}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver skillfully transforms the expression $\frac{1}{a_{n+1}(a_{n+1}-1)}$ into partial fractions $\frac{1}{a_{n+1}-1}-\frac{1}{a_{n+1}}$, which is a sophisticated algebraic manipulation technique.</explanation>

<start>283</start>
<end>468</end>
<text>Therefore, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_{n}}{a_{n+1}}-\frac{b_{n}}{a_{n+3}} =\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_{n}}{a_{n+1}}-\left(\frac{1}{a_{n+1}-1}-\frac{1}{a_{n+1}}\right) =\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_{n}+1}{a_{n+1}}-\frac{1}{a_{n+1}-1}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver manipulates the sum by substituting the derived expression for $\frac{b_{n}}{a_{n+3}}$ and then combining like terms to rewrite the sum in a more useful form. This demonstrates advanced algebraic manipulation skills.</explanation>

<start>469</start>
<end>541</end>
<text>Furthermore, $b_{n}+1=\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n-1}-1}$ for $n \geq 2$. So the sum over $n \geq 2$ is</text>
<explanation>The solver derives another key relationship from the recurrence relations, showing how $b_n+1$ can be expressed in terms of $a$ terms, which will be crucial for further simplification of the sum.</explanation>

<text>$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{a_{n-1}-1}-\frac{1}{a_{n+1}-1}\right) =\lim _{N \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=2}^{N}\left(\frac{1}{a_{n-1}-1}-\frac{1}{a_{n+1}-1}\right) =\frac{1}{a_{1}-1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}-1}-\lim _{N \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{1}{a_{N}-1}+\frac{1}{a_{N+1}-1}\right)$</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that the sum can be expressed as a telescoping series, where consecutive terms cancel out. They rewrite the infinite sum as a limit of finite sums and identify that only the boundary terms remain. This is a sophisticated application of the telescoping series technique.</explanation>

<skill>Limit Evaluation</skill>

<explanation>The solver evaluates the limit as N approaches infinity. Since they established earlier that $a_n$ tends to infinity, they can determine that the limit of the terms $\frac{1}{a_{N}-1}$ and $\frac{1}{a_{N+1}-1}$ approaches zero as N approaches infinity.</explanation>

<start>775</start>
<end>793</end>
<text>=\frac{1}{a_{1}-1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}-1}</text>
<explanation>The solver correctly concludes that the limit terms vanish (approach zero), leaving only the initial terms. This demonstrates their understanding of limits and their ability to evaluate them in the context of the problem.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Substitution</skill>
<definition>The ability to substitute known values or expressions at the right moment to simplify a problem or make progress toward a solution.</definition>

<start>794</start>
<end>906</end>
<text>Hence the final answer is $\left(\frac{b_{1}+1}{a_{2}}-\frac{1}{a_{2}-1}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{a_{1}-1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}-1}\right)$.</text>
<explanation>The solver strategically combines their results, accounting for the n=1 term separately and adding it to the sum for nâ‰¥2. This shows their ability to track different parts of the problem and combine them appropriately.</explanation>

<start>907</start>
<end>1071</end>
<text>Cancelling the common terms and putting in our starting values, this equals $\frac{2014}{2015}+\frac{1}{2014}=1-\frac{1}{2015}+\frac{1}{2014}=1+\frac{1}{2014 \cdot 2015}$</text>

<explanation>The solver analyzes the given recurrence relations to derive properties of the sequences and establish relationships between terms that aren't immediately obvious from the original recurrence relations. This shows a deep understanding of how recurrence relations work.</explanation>

<start>469</start>
<end>541</end>
<text>Furthermore, $b_{n}+1=\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n-1}-1}$ for $n \geq 2$. So the sum over $n \geq 2$ is</text>
<explanation>The solver derives this relationship by manipulating the original recurrence relations, showing their ability to work with and extract useful information from recurrence relations.</explanation>

<skill>Arithmetic Simplification</skill>
<definition>The ability to perform calculations and simplify numerical expressions efficiently to reach a final, concise answer.</definition>

<start>907</start>
<end>1071</end>
<text>Cancelling the common terms and putting in our starting values, this equals $\frac{2014}{2015}+\frac{1}{2014}=1-\frac{1}{2015}+\frac{1}{2014}=1+\frac{1}{2014 \cdot 2015}$</text>
<explanation>The solver efficiently simplifies the numerical expression by first converting $\frac{2014}{2015}$ to $1-\frac{1}{2015}$, then finding a common denominator for the fractions, and finally expressing the result in the simplest possible form. This demonstrates their skill in arithmetic simplification.</explanation>
