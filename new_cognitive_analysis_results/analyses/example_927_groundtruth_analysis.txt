Problem:
A fenced, rectangular field measures 24 meters by 52 meters. An agricultural researcher has 1994 meters of fence that can be used for internal fencing to partition the field into congruent, square test plots. The entire field must be partitioned, and the sides of the squares must be parallel to the edges of the field. What is the largest number of square test plots into which the field can be partitioned using all or some of the 1994 meters of fence?

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
702

Analysis:
I need to analyze a mathematical problem-solving trajectory, but I notice that the provided trajectory is extremely brief - it only contains the answer "702" without showing the solver's thinking process. This makes it difficult to analyze the cognitive skills used.

Since I don't have access to the actual thinking trajectory that led to this answer, I can only make limited observations:

<skill>Solution verification</skill>
<definition>The ability to check that a final answer is reasonable and addresses all parts of the problem.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>702</text>
<explanation>The solver has provided a final numerical answer of 702, which appears to be the result of calculating the maximum number of square test plots. However, without seeing the work, I cannot analyze the verification process that led to this conclusion.</explanation>

Without the actual thinking trajectory showing the problem-solving steps, I cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of the cognitive skills demonstrated. The answer "702" alone doesn't reveal the mathematical reasoning, calculations, or strategies used to arrive at this solution.

SUMMARY_START
1. Solution verification - The solver provided a final numerical answer, though without seeing the work process, I cannot analyze the verification methods used.
SUMMARY_END

Note: To properly analyze cognitive skills in mathematical problem-solving, I would need to see the complete thinking trajectory showing the solver's step-by-step reasoning, not just the final answer.

Summary of Key Skills:
1. Solution verification - The solver provided a final numerical answer, though without seeing the work process, I cannot analyze the verification methods used.
