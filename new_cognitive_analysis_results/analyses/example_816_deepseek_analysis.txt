Problem:
A scientist studies the stress response of barley to increased temperatures and finds a protein which contributes to heat tolerance through the stabilisation of cell membrane. The scientist is very happy and wants to create a heat-tolerant cultivar of diploid wheat. Using databases, they find a heat tolerance protein homologue and start analysing its accumulation under heat stress. Soon enough, the scientist discovers this protein is not synthesised in the wheat cultivar they study. There are many possible reasons for such behaviour, including:
Answer Choices:
(A) The proteolysis process disrupts a quaternary structure of the protein, preserving only a tertiary structure
(B) A stop-codon occurs in the 5’-UTR region of the gene encoding the target protein
(C) A miRNA targets the protein, which makes exonucleases cut it immediately after the end of translation and before processing in ER
(D) Trimethylation of lysine of H3 histone in position 27 at the promoter of the gene encoding the target protein

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Alright, let's tackle this question. So, the scenario is a scientist who found a protein in barley that helps with heat tolerance by stabilizing cell membranes. Now, they're trying to create a heat-tolerant wheat cultivar but they found that the homologous protein in wheat isn't being synthesized. The question is asking for possible reasons why the protein isn't being made. The answer choices are A through D.

First, I need to recall the possible steps involved in gene expression and protein synthesis because if the protein isn't being synthesized, the issue could be at any of those steps: transcription, RNA processing, translation, post-translational modifications, or even protein degradation.

Looking at the answer choices:

Option A: Proteolysis disrupting quaternary structure, leaving tertiary. Proteolysis is the breakdown of proteins. If the protein is being broken down after it's made, maybe it's not functional. But the quaternary structure refers to multiple subunits; if it's disrupted, maybe the protein can't function, but the question says the protein isn't synthesized. So this might relate to the protein being degraded after synthesis. But the scientist observed the protein isn't synthesized, meaning maybe it's not made at all. So maybe A is not the right answer because it's about degradation after synthesis.

Option B: Stop codon in the 5’-UTR of the gene. The 5’-UTR is the untranslated region of the mRNA, which is part of the mRNA that's not translated into protein. If a stop codon is in the 5’-UTR, that doesn't make sense. Wait, but the gene structure includes exons and introns, the mRNA has 5'-UTR, then the coding sequence. The 5’-UTR is upstream of the start codon. So if there's a stop codon in the 5’-UTR, the ribosomes wouldn't have started translating yet. Wait, maybe the mRNA has the stop codon before the actual coding sequence. But then how would that affect? Because the mRNA's start codon is after the UTR. If the UTR has a stop codon, but the ribosome starts translating at the start codon, which is after the UTR, maybe this is a mistake? Wait, maybe the gene has a mutation in the 5’-UTR (which would be part of the DNA) causing a stop codon there. Wait, no. The UTR is transcribed but not translated, unless there's a mutation in the coding region. Alternatively, if the stop codon is mistakenly in the coding region, but given that the question mentions the 5’-UTR. Let me think. The 5' UTR is part of the mRNA that's not translated. So even if there's a stop codon in the UTR, since ribosomes look for the start codon, which is downstream of the UTR, the UTR isn't translated. So a stop codon there wouldn't affect protein synthesis. Unless... Hmm, maybe it's a mutation that introduces a stop codon in the actual coding sequence. But the question says the 5’-UTR region. So perhaps option B is wrong. If the stop codon is in the 5’-UTR, that wouldn't cause premature termination because the translation starts after the UTR. So this might not prevent the protein from being synthesized. So B might not be a correct answer.

Option C: miRNA targets the protein, exonucleases cut it after translation. Wait, miRNAs typically bind to mRNA molecules, not proteins. They usually bind to the 3’ UTR of mRNA to either inhibit translation or lead to mRNA degradation. Exonucleases break down nucleic acids. If the miRNA is targeting the protein, that doesn't align. Wait, the option says the miRNA targets the protein, which makes exonucleases cut it after translation. That seems confused. Because miRNAs target mRNA, not proteins. So maybe this option is mixing up concepts. If miRNA binds to the mRNA, leading to its degradation or translational inhibition. But if the protein is being targeted after translation by something else, that would be proteolysis. But the way option C is written sounds incorrect because miRNA doesn't target proteins. Exonucleases act on nucleic acids; maybe endonucleases or proteases would act on proteins. So this might not make sense. Option C seems flawed. The only way this could be correct is if the miRNA is causing the mRNA to be cut before translation, but even then, the description says "after the end of translation and before processing in ER." Once translation is done, the protein is made. Processing in the ER happens during translation (for secretory proteins). If the protein is cut immediately after translation, maybe by exonucleases (which shouldn't target proteins), but exonucleases are for nucleic acids. So I think option C is incorrect due to incorrect biology.

Option D: Trimethylation of H3 histone lysine 27 at the promoter. Histone modifications can affect gene expression. Trimethylation of H3K27 (H3 histone at lysine 27) is generally associated with gene repression. The promoter region's chromatin being in a repressive state due to H3K27me3 (trimethylation) would mean the gene is not being transcribed. So if this modification is present at the promoter of the gene encoding the target protein, the gene would be silenced. That would prevent the mRNA from being transcribed, hence the protein not being synthesized. That makes sense. If the gene is epigenetically silenced, then even if the gene is present, it's not expressed. So option D is a valid reason.

So going back to the options. The scientist observes that the protein is not synthesized. The possible reasons could be issues in gene expression at any level.

Option D would lead to the gene not being transcribed, no mRNA, so the protein can't be made. That's a solid reason.

Option B: If a stop codon is in the 5’-UTR, as I thought earlier, since the UTR isn't translated, that shouldn't affect the protein. Unless maybe in the gene structure, but in 5’-UTR, DNA mutations leading to a premature stop codon in the actual coding sequence... Wait, no, the 5’-UTR is in the mRNA before the start codon. But perhaps if the stop codon is in the DNA region that corresponds to the mRNA's 5’-UTR, but the start codon is after that. However, stop codons are in the reading frame. Unless there's an upstream open reading frame (uORF) which can regulate translation. However, in general, the presence of a stop codon in the 5’ UTR might lead to some regulation, but usually, the ribosomes would initiate at the correct start codon. However, in some cases, uORFs can affect the translation efficiency of the main ORF. But if the stop codon is present in the 5’-UTR region (as per the answer), but the correct start codon is after that, would that create a problem? For example, if the DNA has a nonsense mutation in the 5’-UTR, would that cause the mRNA to have a premature stop codon? No, because the 5’-UTR is not part of the coding sequence. So even if the 5’-UTR has a stop codon in its sequence, the translation would start later at the correct start codon, so the protein would still be made. Therefore, a stop codon in the 5’-UTR shouldn't prevent the protein from being synthesized. Hence, option B is incorrect.

Option A is about proteolysis of the protein after it's made, but the problem is that the protein isn't synthesized. So A is about degradation after synthesis, which isn't the case here. The protein is not made at all. Therefore, A is not the right answer.

Option C is biologically incorrect because miRNAs target mRNA, not proteins. So if the mRNA is being targeted by miRNA, it would have less mRNA available for translation. However, option C says the miRNA targets the protein, which is a mistake. So C is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Histone trimethylation leading to gene silencing would stop transcription, so the protein isn't synthesized.
