Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let's break down the problem into smaller pieces and address each part systematically.

Part (a): Express \( f_{t, \varepsilon}(x) \) in terms of the standard normal distribution function \( \Phi(\cdot).\)

We are asked for the probability density of \( W(1) \) at \( x \ge 0, \) conditioned on the event \( \{X(0, t) > -\varepsilon\}. \)
The event \( \{X(0, t) > -\varepsilon\} \) means that \( \inf_{u \in [0,t]} \{W(u)\} > -\varepsilon \).
We are looking for \( P(W(1) \in dy \mid \inf_{u \in [0,t]} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \) for \( y \ge 0 \).
Using the definition of conditional probability, this is equal to \( \frac{P(W(1) \in dy, \inf_{u \in [0,t]} W(u) > -\varepsilon)}{P(\inf_{u \in [0,t]} W(u) > -\varepsilon)} \).

Let's find the numerator: \( P(W(1) \in dy, \inf_{u \in [0,t]} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \).
Since \( W(1) \in dy \) implies \( W(1) \approx y \), we have \( P(W(1) \in dy, \inf_{u \in [0,t]} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \approx P(y \in dy, \inf_{u \in [0,t]} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \).
If \( y < 0 \), the probability is 0 since \( \inf_{u \in [0,t]} W(u) > -\varepsilon \) doesn't automatically imply \( W(1) \ge 0 \). However, we are considering the density of \( W(1) \) at \( x \ge 0 \), so \( y \ge 0 \).
For \( y \ge 0 \), \( \inf_{u \in [0,t]} W(u) > -\varepsilon \) is the main condition.
We can write \( P(W(1) \in dy, \inf_{u \in [0,t]} W(u) > -\varepsilon) = P(y \in dy, \min_{u \in [0,t]} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \).
For \(y \ge 0\), the condition \( \min_{u \in [0,t]} W(u) > -\varepsilon \) is equivalent to saying the Brownian motion stays above \( -\varepsilon \) up to time \( t \).
We know from the reflection principle that \( P(\inf_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) \le a) = 2 P(W(t) \le a) \) for \( a \le 0 \).
So, \( P(\inf_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > -\varepsilon) = 1 - P(\inf_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) \le -\varepsilon) = 1 - 2 P(W(t) \le -\varepsilon) = 1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t}) \).

Now consider the numerator \( P(W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > -\varepsilon) \) for \( x \ge 0 \).
This is the probability that \( W(1) \in dx \) and the minimum of the Brownian motion up to time \( t \) is greater than \( -\varepsilon \).
Since \( 1 < t \), the minimum in the interval \( [0, t] \) is influenced by the behavior of the Brownian motion up to time \( 1 \) and beyond.
Let's consider the event \( \{W(1) \in dx, \min_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > -\varepsilon\} \).
If \( x \ge 0 \), then \( \min_{0 \le s \le 1} W(s) > -\varepsilon \) implies \( \min_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > -\varepsilon \).
We need to consider the paths where \( W(1) \in dx \) and the minimum is above \( -\varepsilon \).
Using the reflection principle, \( P(W(1) \in dx, \min_{0 \le s \le 1} W(s) > -\varepsilon) = P(W(1) \in dx) - P(W(1) \in dx, \min_{0 \le s \le 1} W(s) \le -\varepsilon) \).
\( P(W(1) \in dx, \min_{0 \le s \le 1} W(s) \le -\varepsilon) = P(W(1) \in dx, \sup_{0 \le s \le 1} -W(s) \ge \varepsilon) \).
This seems more complex than necessary.

Let's go back to the conditional probability formula.
The denominator is \( P(\inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon) = 1 - P(\inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) \le -\varepsilon) = 1 - 2 P(W(t) \le -\varepsilon) = 1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t}) \).
The numerator is \( P(W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \). For \( x \ge 0 \), the condition \( \inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon \) is important.
Consider the event \( A = \{W(1) \in dx\} \) and \( B = \{\inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon\} \). We want \( P(A \cap B) \).
Since \( 1 < t \), the minimum up to time \( t \) is influenced by the path up to time 1.
We can use the result that \( P(W(t) \in da, \min_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > b) = P(W(t) \in da) - P(W(t) \in da, \min_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) \le b) \).
Using the reflection principle at the level \( b \): \( P(W(t) > a, \min_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > b) = P(W(t) > a) - P(W(t) < 2b - a) \), for \( a > b \).
Here we have \( \inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon \), which means \( W(u) > -\varepsilon \) for all \( u \in [0, t] \).
We want the density of \( W(1) \) at \( x \ge 0 \) conditioned on \( \inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon \).
For \( x \ge 0 \), the event is \( \{W(1) \in dx\} \cap \{\inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon\} \).
Since \( x \ge 0 \), if the minimum up to time 1 is greater than \( -\varepsilon \), it doesn't guarantee the minimum up to time \( t \) is.

Let's use the joint density of \( (W(1), \min_{0 \le u \le t} W(u)) \). This seems hard.

Consider the event \( \{W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon\} \) for \( x \ge 0 \).
This is equivalent to \( \{W(1) \in dx\} \cap \{\inf_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon\} \) because if \( W(1) = x \ge 0 \) and the minimum up to \( t \) is greater than \( -\varepsilon \), then the minimum up to \( 1 \) must be greater than \( -\varepsilon \).
So, the numerator is \( P(W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \).
For \( x \ge 0 \), this is \( P(W(1) \in dx) - P(W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) \le -\varepsilon) \).
\( P(W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) \le -\varepsilon) = P(W(1) \in dx, \sup_{0 \le u \le 1} -W(u) \ge \varepsilon) \).
Using the reflection principle: \( P(\sup_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) \ge a, W(t) \in dy) = P(W(t) \in dy, \exists s \le t: W(s) \ge a) \).
This is equal to \( P(W(t) \in dy, M_t \ge a) \), where \( M_t = \sup_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) \).
The joint density of \( (W(t), M_t) \) is given by \( f_{W_t, M_t}(y, m) = \frac{2(2m-y)}{\sqrt{2\pi t^3}} e^{-\frac{(2m-y)^2}{2t}} \) for \( m \ge 0, y \le m \).

Let's use the formula \( P(\inf_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > a, W(t) \in db) = (n(b; 0, t) - n(2a - b; 0, t)) db \) for \( b > a \), where \( n(x; \mu, \sigma^2) \) is the density of \( N(\mu, \sigma^2) \).
Here, \( a = -\varepsilon \) and \( t = 1 \). We are interested in \( W(1) = x \ge 0 > -\varepsilon \).
\( P(\inf_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon, W(1) \in dx) = (\phi(x) - \phi(-2\varepsilon - x)) dx \), where \( \phi(x) \) is the standard normal density.
\( \phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2} \).
So the numerator is \( (\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)) dx \).
The denominator is \( P(\inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon) = 1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t}) \).
Therefore, \( f_{t, \varepsilon}(x) = \frac{\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)}{1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t})} \) for \( x \ge 0 \).

Part (b): Compute the density \( g(x) \) of \( R := \sqrt{G_1^2 + G_2^2 + G_3^2}, \) for i.i.d. standard normal variables \( G_i, i = 1,2,3. \) Then deduce from (a) that \[ g(x) = \lim_{t \to \infty, \varepsilon \downarrow 0} \{f_{t, \varepsilon}(x)\} . \]

The random variable \( R \) follows a chi distribution with \( k=3 \) degrees of freedom.
The density of \( R \) is given by \( g(x) = \frac{2}{\Gamma(k/2)} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{k/2} x^{k-1} e^{-x^2/2} \) for \( x \ge 0 \).
For \( k=3 \), \( \Gamma(3/2) = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \).
\( g(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}/2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{3/2} x^{3-1} e^{-x^2/2} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{\pi}} \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} x^2 e^{-x^2/2} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}} x^2 e^{-x^2/2} \) for \( x \ge 0 \).

Now we need to compute the limit of \( f_{t, \varepsilon}(x) \) as \( t \to \infty \) and \( \varepsilon \downarrow 0 \).
\( f_{t, \varepsilon}(x) = \frac{\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)}{1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t})} \) for \( x \ge 0 \).

Consider the denominator as \( t \to \infty \): \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t}) = \Phi(0) = 1/2 \).
So, \( \lim_{t \to \infty} (1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t})) = 1 - 2(1/2) = 0 \). This seems problematic.

Let's re-evaluate the numerator.
We used the fact that for \( x \ge 0 \), \( \{W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon\} \) is equivalent to \( \{W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon\} \). This is because if \( W(1) = x \ge 0 \), and the minimum on \( [0, t] \) is above \( -\varepsilon \), then the minimum on \( [0, 1] \) is also above \( -\varepsilon \).

The denominator: \( \lim_{t \to \infty} P(\inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon) = P(\inf_{0 \le u < \infty} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \).
Since Brownian motion drifts to \( -\infty \), this probability is 0. This is also problematic.

Let's think about the conditioning. We are conditioning on an event that has probability approaching 0 as \( t \to \infty \).

Let's re-examine the numerator and denominator separately.
Numerator: \( \lim_{\varepsilon \downarrow 0} (\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)) = \phi(x) - \phi(x) = 0 \).

Let's check the standard result for Brownian motion conditioned to stay positive.
The density of \( W(t) \) conditioned on \( \inf_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > 0 \) is \( \frac{P(W(t) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > 0)}{P(\inf_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > 0)} \).
\( P(\inf_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > 0) = P(\min_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > 0) = 1 - P(\min_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) \le 0) = 1 - 2 P(W(t) \le 0) = 1 - 2 \Phi(0) = 1 - 2(1/2) = 0 \).

Let's consider the case when the conditioning level is \( -\varepsilon \).
Denominator: \( P(\inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon) = 1 - P(\inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) \le -\varepsilon) = 1 - 2 P(W(t) \le -\varepsilon) = 1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t}) \).
As \( \varepsilon \downarrow 0 \), \( \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t}) \to \Phi(0) = 1/2 \), so the denominator approaches \( 1 - 2(1/2) = 0 \).

Numerator: \( P(W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \).
For \( x \ge 0 \), this is \( P(W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon) = (\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)) dx \).

Let's focus on the limit. First, let \( t \to \infty \).
\( \lim_{t \to \infty} f_{t, \varepsilon}(x) = \frac{\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)}{1 - 2 \lim_{t \to \infty} \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t})} = \frac{\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)}{1 - 2 \Phi(0)} = \frac{\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)}{0} \).

There must be a mistake in my interpretation or calculation.

Consider the probability density of \( W(1) \) conditioned on \( \inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon \).
Let \( A = \{W(1) \in dx\} \) and \( B = \{\inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon\} \).
We are looking for \( P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \).
\( P(B) = 1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t}) \).
\( P(A \cap B) = P(W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \).
For \( x \ge 0 \), this is \( P(W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \).
The density of \( W(1) \) is \( \phi(y) \).
We need \( P(W(1) \in dx, \min_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \).
This is the probability that the Brownian motion stays above \( -\varepsilon \) up to time 1 and \( W(1) \in dx \).
Using the reflection principle: \( P(\min_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > a, W(t) \in db) = P(W(t) \in db) - P(W(t) \in db, \min_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) \le a) \).
\( = P(W(t) \in db) - P(W(t) \in db, \sup_{0 \le s \le t} -W(s) \ge -a) \).
Using the reflection principle at level \( a \): \( P(W(t) > a, \min_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > b) = P(W(t) > a) - P(W(t) < 2b - a) \) for \( a > b \).
Here, we have \( \min_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon \).
Consider the event \( \{W(1) > x, \min_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon\} \) for \( x \ge 0 > -\varepsilon \).
Using the formula with \( t=1, a=x, b=-\varepsilon \):
\( P(W(1) > x, \min_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon) = P(W(1) > x) - P(W(1) < -2\varepsilon - x) \)
\( = (1 - \Phi(x)) - \Phi(-2\varepsilon - x) \).
The probability \( P(W(1) \in dx, \min_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \) corresponds to the density.
The density is the derivative with respect to \( x \).
\( \frac{d}{dx} [ (1 - \Phi(x)) - \Phi(-2\varepsilon - x) ] = -\phi(x) - \phi(-2\varepsilon - x) (-1) = -\phi(x) + \phi(2\varepsilon + x) \).
So the density of \( W(1) \) conditioned on \( \inf_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon \) at \( x \ge 0 \) is \( \frac{\phi(x + 2\varepsilon) - \phi(x)}{P(\inf_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon)} \).
\( P(\inf_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon) = 1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon) \).
So, \( f_{t, \varepsilon}(x) = \frac{\phi(x + 2\varepsilon) - \phi(x)}{1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon)} \) for \( x \ge 0 \).
This does not depend on \( t \) anymore.

Let's reconsider the condition \( \inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon \).

We are looking for the density of \( W(1) \) at \( x \ge 0 \) conditioned on \( \min_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon \).
The conditional density is \( f_{t, \varepsilon}(x) = \frac{\frac{d}{dx} P(W(1) \le x, \min_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon)}{P(\min_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon)} \).
Denominator: \( 1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t}) \).
Numerator (CDF): \( P(W(1) \le x, \min_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \).
For \( x \ge 0 \), this is \( P(W(1) \le x, \min_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \).
\( = P(-\varepsilon < \min_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u), W(1) \le x) \).
Using the joint distribution of \( (\min_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u), W(1)) \).
\( P(\min_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon, W(1) \le x) = P(W(1) \le x) - P(\min_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) \le -\varepsilon, W(1) \le x) \).
\( = \Phi(x) - P(\sup_{0 \le u \le 1} -W(u) \ge \varepsilon, W(1) \le x) \).
\( = \Phi(x) - P(\exists u \in [0, 1]: -W(u) \ge \varepsilon, W(1) \le x) \).
Using reflection principle: \( P(\min_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) > a, W(t) \le b) = P(W(t) \le b) - P(W(t) \le b, \min_{0 \le s \le t} W(s) \le a) \).
\( = \Phi(b/\sqrt{t}) - P(W(t) \le b, M_t^* \ge -a) \), where \( M_t^* = \sup_{0 \le s \le t} (-W(s)) \).
\( = \Phi(b/\sqrt{t}) - P(-W(t) \ge -b, M_t^* \ge -a) \).

Let's use the density directly.
The density of \( W(1) \) conditioned on \( \inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon \) at \( x \ge 0 \) is
\( f_{t, \varepsilon}(x) = \frac{P(W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon)}{P(\inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon)} \).
Numerator: \( (\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)) dx \).
Denominator: \( 1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t}) \).
\( f_{t, \varepsilon}(x) = \frac{\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)}{1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t})} \) for \( x \ge 0 \).

Now consider the limit: \( \lim_{t \to \infty, \varepsilon \downarrow 0} f_{t, \varepsilon}(x) \).
Limit as \( \varepsilon \downarrow 0 \): \( \lim_{\varepsilon \downarrow 0} \frac{\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)}{1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t})} \).
Numerator \( \to \phi(x) - \phi(x) = 0 \).
Denominator \( \to 1 - 2 \Phi(0) = 0 \).
Use L'Hopital's rule with respect to \( \varepsilon \).
Derivative of numerator wrt \( \varepsilon \): \( -\phi'(x + 2\varepsilon) \cdot 2 \).
Derivative of denominator wrt \( \varepsilon \): \( -2 \phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t}) \cdot (-1/\sqrt{t}) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{t}} \phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t}) \).
Limit \( \frac{-2 \phi'(x)}{ \frac{2}{\sqrt{t}} \phi(0) } = -\sqrt{t} \frac{\phi'(x)}{\phi(0)} \). This depends on \( t \).

Let's consider the limits in the specified order.
First \( t \to \infty \): \( \lim_{t \to \infty} f_{t, \varepsilon}(x) = \frac{\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)}{1 - 2 \Phi(0)} = \frac{\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)}{0} \).

Consider the density of \( |W(1)| \). For \( x > 0 \), it is \( \phi(x) + \phi(-x) = 2 \phi(x) \).
The distribution of \( \sqrt{W_1^2 + W_2^2 + W_3^2} \) where \( W_i \) are independent standard normal is the chi distribution with 3 degrees of freedom.

The result in part (a) should involve \( \Phi \).
Final check of part (a):
\( f_{t, \varepsilon}(x) = \frac{\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)}{1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t})} \) for \( x \ge 0 \).

Consider the limit of \( g(x) \).
\( \lim_{t \to \infty, \varepsilon \downarrow 0} \frac{\phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon)}{1 - 2 \Phi(-\varepsilon/\sqrt{t})} \).
Limit as \( \varepsilon \downarrow 0 \): \( \frac{\phi(x) - \phi(x)}{1 - 2 \Phi(0)} = \frac{0}{0} \).

Let's use the alternative expression for the numerator:
\( P(W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le u \le t} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \). For \( x \ge 0 \), this is \( P(W(1) \in dx, \inf_{0 \le u \le 1} W(u) > -\varepsilon) \).
Density is \( \phi(x) - \phi(x + 2\varepsilon) \).
