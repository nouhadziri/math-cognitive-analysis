Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let X and Y be metric spaces and $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ be a continuous function.
We are given that for every compact set $K \subseteq Y$, its pre-image $f^{pre}(K) = \{x \in X : f(x) \in K\}$ is a compact set in X.
We need to prove that $f$ is a closed function, i.e., for every closed set $C \subseteq X$, its image $f(C) = \{f(x) : x \in C\}$ is a closed subset of Y.

To prove that $f(C)$ is a closed subset of Y, we need to show that it contains all of its limit points.
Let $y$ be a limit point of $f(C)$. This means that there exists a sequence $(y_n)$ in $f(C)$ such that $y_n \to y$.
Since $y_n \in f(C)$, for each $n$, there exists $x_n \in C$ such that $f(x_n) = y_n$.
So, we have a sequence $(x_n)$ in $C$. We need to show that $y \in f(C)$.
If the sequence $(x_n)$ has a convergent subsequence in $C$, then we are done. Let $(x_{n_k})$ be a subsequence of $(x_n)$ that converges to some $x \in C$. Since $f$ is continuous, $f(x_{n_k}) \to f(x)$. Also, $f(x_{n_k}) = y_{n_k}$, and since $y_n \to y$, the subsequence $y_{n_k} \to y$. Therefore, $f(x) = y$, and since $x \in C$, $y \in f(C)$.

However, we don't know if $(x_n)$ has a convergent subsequence in $C$.

Consider the set $K = \{y\} \cup \{y_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. Since $y_n \to y$, the set $K$ is a compact subset of Y.
By the given condition, $f^{pre}(K)$ is a compact subset of X.
Since $y_n \in K$, $x_n \in f^{pre}(K)$.
So, $(x_n)$ is a sequence in the compact set $f^{pre}(K)$. Therefore, there exists a convergent subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ that converges to some $x \in f^{pre}(K)$.
Since $C$ is a closed set and $x_n \in C$ for all $n$, the limit of the subsequence $x$ must also be in $C$. So $x \in C$.
Since $f$ is continuous, $f(x_{n_k}) \to f(x)$.
Also, $f(x_{n_k}) = y_{n_k}$, and since $y_n \to y$, the subsequence $y_{n_k} \to y$.
Therefore, $f(x) = y$.
Since $x \in C$, we have $y = f(x) \in f(C)$.
Thus, $f(C)$ contains all of its limit points and is therefore closed.

Alternative approach:
Let C be a closed subset of X. We want to show that $Y \setminus f(C)$ is an open set.
Let $y \in Y \setminus f(C)$. This means $y \notin f(C)$, so there is no $x \in C$ such that $f(x) = y$.
Consider the compact sets in Y.

Let $y \in \overline{f(C)}$. Then there exists a sequence $(y_n)$ in $f(C)$ such that $y_n \to y$.
For each $y_n$, there exists $x_n \in C$ such that $f(x_n) = y_n$.
Consider the set $K = \{y\} \cup \{y_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. Since $y_n \to y$, $K$ is compact.
Then $f^{-1}(K)$ is compact in X.
The sequence $(x_n)$ is in $f^{-1}(K)$. Since $f^{-1}(K)$ is compact, there is a convergent subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ that converges to some $x \in f^{-1}(K)$.
Since $C$ is closed and $x_n \in C$ for all $n$, the limit $x$ is also in $C$.
Since $f$ is continuous, $f(x_{n_k}) \to f(x)$.
Also, $f(x_{n_k}) = y_{n_k}$, and $y_{n_k} \to y$.
So $f(x) = y$.
Since $x \in C$, $y = f(x) \in f(C)$.
Thus $\overline{f(C)} \subseteq f(C)$. Since $f(C) \subseteq \overline{f(C)}$, we have $f(C) = \overline{f(C)}$, which means $f(C)$ is closed.

Final check of the argument:
Let C be a closed subset of X.
We want to show that $f(C)$ is closed in Y.
Let $y$ be a limit point of $f(C)$.
Then there exists a sequence $(y_n)$ in $f(C)$ such that $y_n \to y$.
For each $n$, since $y_n \in f(C)$, there exists $x_n \in C$ such that $f(x_n) = y_n$.
Consider the set $K = \{y\} \cup \{y_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. Since $y_n \to y$, $K$ is a compact subset of Y.
By the given condition, the preimage $f^{-1}(K)$ is a compact subset of X.
The sequence $(x_n)$ is in $f^{-1}(K)$ because $f(x_n) = y_n \in K$.
Since $f^{-1}(K)$ is compact, the sequence $(x_n)$ has a convergent subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ that converges to some $x \in f^{-1}(K)$.
Since $C$ is closed and $x_n \in C$ for all $n$, the limit of the subsequence $x$ must also be in $C$.
So $x \in C$.
Since $f$ is continuous, $f(x_{n_k}) \to f(x)$.
We also know that $f(x_{n_k}) = y_{n_k}$, and since $(y_n)$ converges to $y$, the subsequence $(y_{n_k})$ also converges to $y$.
Therefore, $f(x) = y$.
Since $x \in C$, we have $y = f(x) \in f(C)$.
Since every limit point of $f(C)$ is in $f(C)$, the set $f(C)$ is closed.

<text>To prove that $f(C)$ is a closed subset of Y, we need to show that it contains all of its limit points.</text>
<explanation>The solver translates the abstract definition of a closed set (a set containing all its limit points) into a concrete approach for the proof. This demonstrates the ability to convert formal mathematical definitions into actionable proof strategies.</explanation>

<start>1863</start>
<end>1967</end>
<text>Let C be a closed subset of X. We want to show that $Y \setminus f(C)$ is an open set.</text>
<explanation>In the alternative approach, the solver translates the problem of showing $f(C)$ is closed into the equivalent problem of showing its complement is open, demonstrating flexibility in conceptual representation.</explanation>

<text>Let $y$ be a limit point of $f(C)$. This means that there exists a sequence $(y_n)$ in $f(C)$ such that $y_n \to y$.</text>
<explanation>The solver sets up what could develop into a proof by contradiction by assuming $y$ is a limit point of $f(C)$ and then working to show that $y$ must be in $f(C)$. If it weren't, this would contradict the assumption that $f(C)$ is closed.</explanation>

So, we have a sequence $(x_n)$ in $C$. We need to show that $y \in f(C)$.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates sequential reasoning by establishing a logical chain: since each $y_n$ is in $f(C)$, there must be corresponding $x_n$ values in $C$. This creates a sequence in $C$ that will be crucial for the next steps in the proof.</explanation>

<start>2122</start>

Consider the set $K = \{y\} \cup \{y_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. Since $y_n \to y$, $K$ is compact.
Then $f^{-1}(K)$ is compact in X.
The sequence $(x_n)$ is in $f^{-1}(K)$. Since $f^{-1}(K)$ is compact, there is a convergent subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ that converges to some $x \in f^{-1}(K)$.</text>
<explanation>This passage shows sequential reasoning through a chain of logical deductions: from the existence of a convergent sequence in $f(C)$ to the construction of a compact set $K$, to the application of the given condition about pre-images, to the existence of a convergent subsequence.</explanation>

<text>Let C be a closed subset of X.
We want to show that $f(C)$ is closed in Y.
Let $y$ be a limit point of $f(C)$.
Then there exists a sequence $(y_n)$ in $f(C)$ such that $y_n \to y$.
For each $n$, since $y_n \in f(C)$, there exists $x_n \in C$ such that $f(x_n) = y_n$.
Consider the set $K = \{y\} \cup \{y_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. Since $y_n \to y$, $K$ is a compact subset of Y.
By the given condition, the preimage $f^{-1}(K)$ is a compact subset of X.
The sequence $(x_n)$ is in $f^{-1}(K)$ because $f(x_n) = y_n \in K$.
Since $f^{-1}(K)$ is compact, the sequence $(x_n)$ has a convergent subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ that converges to some $x \in f^{-1}(K)$.
Since $C$ is closed and $x_n \in C$ for all $n$, the limit of the subsequence $x$ must also be in $C$.
So $x \in C$.
Since $f$ is continuous, $f(x_{n_k}) \to f(x)$.
We also know that $f(x_{n_k}) = y_{n_k}$, and since $(y_n)$ converges to $y$, the subsequence $(y_{n_k})$ also converges to $y$.
Therefore, $f(x) = y$.
Since $x \in C$, we have $y = f(x) \in f(C)$.
Since every limit point of $f(C)$ is in $f(C)$, the set $f(C)$ is closed.</text>

Consider the compact sets in Y.</text>
<explanation>Here the solver begins developing a completely different approach to the problem by trying to show the complement of $f(C)$ is open, which is an equivalent condition to $f(C)$ being closed.
