Problem:
For her zeroth project at Magic School, Emilia needs to grow six perfectly-shaped apple trees. First she plants six tree saplings at the end of Day  $0$ . On each day afterwards, Emilia attempts to use her magic to turn each sapling into a perfectly-shaped apple tree, and for each sapling she succeeds in turning it into a perfectly-shaped apple tree that day with a probability of  $\frac{1}{2}$ . (Once a sapling is turned into a perfectly-shaped apple tree, it will stay a perfectly-shaped apple tree.) The expected number of days it will take Emilia to obtain six perfectly-shaped apple trees is  $\frac{m}{n}$  for relatively prime positive integers  $m$  and  $n$ . Find  $100m+n$ .

*Proposed by Yannick Yao*

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
To solve this problem, we need to find the expected number of days it will take Emilia to obtain six perfectly-shaped apple trees. We will use the concept of expected value and probability to solve this problem.

1. **Define the Random Variable:**
   Let \( X \) be the number of days it takes to turn all six saplings into perfectly-shaped apple trees.

2. **Probability of Success:**
   Each day, the probability that a single sapling turns into a perfectly-shaped apple tree is \( \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, the probability that a sapling does not turn into a perfectly-shaped apple tree on a given day is also \( \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   We need to calculate the expected value \( E(X) \). We will use the fact that the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their expected values.

4. **Expected Value for Each Tree:**
   Let \( E_i \) be the expected number of days to turn the \( i \)-th sapling into a perfectly-shaped apple tree. Since each sapling has an independent probability of \( \frac{1}{2} \) to turn into a tree each day, the expected number of days for one sapling is:
   \[
   E_i = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^k = 2
   \]
   This is because the expected value of a geometric distribution with success probability \( p \) is \( \frac{1}{p} \).

5. **Expected Value for All Trees:**
   Since the trees are independent, the expected number of days for all six trees is the sum of the expected values for each tree. However, we need to account for the fact that the trees are not all independent in terms of the total time taken. We use the linearity of expectation and the fact that the expected value of the maximum of independent geometric random variables is given by:
   \[
   E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{6} \frac{1}{i}
   \]
   This is because the expected value of the maximum of \( n \) independent geometric random variables with parameter \( p \) is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{i} \).

6. **Harmonic Series:**
   The sum \( \sum_{i=1}^{6} \frac{1}{i} \) is the 6th harmonic number:
   \[
   H_6 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6}
   \]

7. **Calculate the Harmonic Number:**
   \[
   H_6 = 1 + 0.5 + 0.3333 + 0.25 + 0.2 + 0.1667 = 2.45
   \]

8. **Expected Value:**
   Therefore, the expected number of days \( E(X) \) is:
   \[
   E(X) = 2 \cdot H_6 = 2 \cdot 2.45 = 4.9
   \]

9. **Simplify the Fraction:**
   The expected number of days is \( \frac{49}{10} \). Here, \( m = 49 \) and \( n = 10 \).

10. **Final Calculation:**
    \[
    100m + n = 100 \cdot 49 + 10 = 4900 + 10 = 4910
    \]

The final answer is \( \boxed{4910} \).
