Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the area of the intersection of two congruent triangles, $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle BAD$, which share a common side $AB$. The vertices $C$ and $D$ are on the same side of the line $AB$.

The given side lengths are $AB=9, BC=AD=10, CA=DB=17$.
Since the side lengths of $\triangle ABC$ are $AB=9, BC=10, CA=17$, and the side lengths of $\triangle BAD$ are $BA=9, AD=10, DB=17$, the two triangles are indeed congruent.

Let the coordinates of $A$ be $(0,0)$ and $B$ be $(9,0)$. We need to find the coordinates of $C$ and $D$.

For point $C$, let its coordinates be $(x,y)$. Using the distance formula:
$AC^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 17^2 = 289$
$BC^2 = (x-9)^2 + y^2 = 10^2 = 100$

Substituting $y^2 = 289 - x^2$ into the second equation:
$(x-9)^2 + (289 - x^2) = 100$
$x^2 - 18x + 81 + 289 - x^2 = 100$
$-18x + 370 = 100$
$-18x = 100 - 370 = -270$
$x = \frac{270}{18} = 15$

Now, find $y$:
$y^2 = 289 - x^2 = 289 - 15^2 = 289 - 225 = 64$
$y = \pm 8$

Since $C$ and $D$ are on the same side of line $AB$, we can assume the positive $y$ value for one of the points. Let $C = (15, 8)$.

Now consider $\triangle BAD$. The vertices are $B=(9,0), A=(0,0), D=(x', y')$.
$AD^2 = (x'-0)^2 + (y'-0)^2 = x'^2 + y'^2 = 10^2 = 100$
$BD^2 = (x'-9)^2 + (y'-0)^2 = (x'-9)^2 + y'^2 = 17^2 = 289$

Substituting $y'^2 = 100 - x'^2$ into the second equation:
$(x'-9)^2 + (100 - x'^2) = 289$
$x'^2 - 18x' + 81 + 100 - x'^2 = 289$
$-18x' + 181 = 289$
$-18x' = 289 - 181 = 108$
$x' = -\frac{108}{18} = -6$

Now, find $y'$:
$y'^2 = 100 - x'^2 = 100 - (-6)^2 = 100 - 36 = 64$
$y' = \pm 8$

Since $C$ and $D$ are on the same side of line $AB$, and $C$ has a positive $y$-coordinate, $D$ must also have a positive $y$-coordinate. So, $y' = 8$.
Thus, $D = (-6, 8)$.

The vertices of the two triangles are $A=(0,0), B=(9,0), C=(15,8)$ and $A=(0,0), B=(9,0), D=(-6,8)$.

The intersection of the two triangular regions is a polygon. The vertices of this polygon are the points where the sides of the two triangles intersect.

The sides of $\triangle ABC$ are the line segments $AB, BC, CA$.
The sides of $\triangle BAD$ are the line segments $BA, AD, DB$.

Equations of the lines containing the sides:
Line $AB$: $y = 0$
Line $BC$: Passes through $B(9,0)$ and $C(15,8)$. Slope $m = \frac{8-0}{15-9} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}$.
Equation: $y - 0 = \frac{4}{3}(x - 9) \implies y = \frac{4}{3}x - 12$

Line $CA$: Passes through $C(15,8)$ and $A(0,0)$. Slope $m = \frac{8-0}{15-0} = \frac{8}{15}$.
Equation: $y = \frac{8}{15}x$

Line $AD$: Passes through $A(0,0)$ and $D(-6,8)$. Slope $m = \frac{8-0}{-6-0} = -\frac{8}{6} = -\frac{4}{3}$.
Equation: $y = -\frac{4}{3}x$

Line $DB$: Passes through $D(-6,8)$ and $B(9,0)$. Slope $m = \frac{0-8}{9-(-6)} = \frac{-8}{15}$.
Equation: $y - 0 = -\frac{8}{15}(x - 9) \implies y = -\frac{8}{15}x + \frac{72}{15}$

The intersection of the two triangles is a quadrilateral. The vertices of this quadrilateral are $A, B$, and the intersection points of the other sides.

Intersection of $BC$ and $AD$:
$\frac{4}{3}x - 12 = -\frac{4}{3}x$
$\frac{8}{3}x = 12$
$x = 12 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{36}{8} = \frac{9}{2}$
$y = -\frac{4}{3} \times \frac{9}{2} = -6$. This intersection point is below the x-axis, which is not possible since the intersection is within the triangles. Let's recheck the geometry.

Let's visualize the setup. The two triangles share the base $AB$.
The order of vertices matters for congruence. $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle BAD$.
This means the transformation that maps $\triangle ABC$ to $\triangle BAD$ maps $A \to B, B \to A, C \to D$.

The intersection of the two triangles is a quadrilateral $APBQ$, where $P$ is the intersection of $AC$ and $BD$, and $Q$ is the intersection of $BC$ and $AD$.

Intersection of $AC$ and $BD$:
$y = \frac{8}{15}x$ and $y = -\frac{8}{15}x + \frac{72}{15}$
$\frac{8}{15}x = -\frac{8}{15}x + \frac{72}{15}$
$\frac{16}{15}x = \frac{72}{15}$
$16x = 72$
$x = \frac{72}{16} = \frac{9}{2}$
$y = \frac{8}{15} \times \frac{9}{2} = \frac{72}{30} = \frac{12}{5}$
So, $P = (\frac{9}{2}, \frac{12}{5})$.

Intersection of $BC$ and $AD$:
$y = \frac{4}{3}x - 12$ and $y = -\frac{4}{3}x$
$\frac{4}{3}x - 12 = -\frac{4}{3}x$
$\frac{8}{3}x = 12$
$x = \frac{36}{8} = \frac{9}{2}$
$y = -\frac{4}{3} \times \frac{9}{2} = -6$.

There must be an error in the assumption about the intersection points.
Let's consider the vertices of the intersection polygon. These are the vertices shared by both triangles and the intersection points of the sides. The shared vertices are $A$ and $B$.

The intersection polygon is formed by the overlapping region. The boundaries of this region are parts of the sides of the triangles.

Consider the ordering of the vertices around the intersection polygon. The vertices are $A, X, B, Y$, where $X$ is on $AC$ and $AD$, and $Y$ is on $BC$ and $BD$.

Intersection of $AC$ and $AD$: Only at point $A$.
Intersection of $AC$ and $BD$: Point $P = (\frac{9}{2}, \frac{12}{5})$.
Intersection of $AC$ and $AB$: Point $A$.

Intersection of $BC$ and $AD$: Let's recheck the equations.
Line $BC$: $4x - 3y - 36 = 0$
Line $AD$: $4x + 3y = 0$
Adding the equations: $8x - 36 = 0 \implies x = \frac{36}{8} = \frac{9}{2}$
$3y = -4x = -4 \times \frac{9}{2} = -18 \implies y = -6$.
This intersection point is outside the region of interest.

Intersection of $BC$ and $BD$: Point $B$.

Consider the geometry without coordinates. The intersection is a quadrilateral with vertices $A, B$, and the intersection of the sides $AC$ with $BD$, and $BC$ with $AD$.

Let the intersection point of $AC$ and $BD$ be $P$.
Let the intersection point of $BC$ and $AD$ be $Q$.

The intersection polygon has vertices $A, B, P$. It seems like a triangle. Let's sketch the configuration.

Draw line segment $AB$. Place $C$ and $D$ on the same side.
$\triangle ABC \cong \triangle BAD$.

The intersection is likely a quadrilateral $APBQ$, where $P$ is the intersection of $AC$ and $BD$, and $Q$ is the intersection of $BC$ and $AD$.

Let's re-evaluate the intersection points.
Point $P$ lies on $AC$, so it can be written as $(1-\lambda)A + \lambda C$ for $0 < \lambda < 1$.
Point $P$ lies on $BD$, so it can be written as $(1-\mu)B + \mu D$ for $0 < \mu < 1$.

Point $Q$ lies on $BC$, so it can be written as $(1-\alpha)B + \alpha C$ for $0 < \alpha < 1$.
Point $Q$ lies on $AD$, so it can be written as $(1-\beta)A + \beta D$ for $0 < \beta < 1$.

Using vector representation:
$\vec{P} = (1-\lambda)\vec{A} + \lambda \vec{C} = (1-\mu)\vec{B} + \mu \vec{D}$
$\vec{Q} = (1-\alpha)\vec{B} + \alpha \vec{C} = (1-\beta)\vec{A} + \beta \vec{D}$

With $A=(0,0), B=(9,0), C=(15,8), D=(-6,8)$.
$\vec{P} = \lambda (15, 8) = (1-\mu)(9,0) + \mu (-6, 8)$
$(15\lambda, 8\lambda) = (9(1-\mu) - 6\mu, 8\mu) = (9 - 9\mu - 6\mu, 8\mu) = (9 - 15\mu, 8\mu)$
$8\lambda = 8\mu \implies \lambda = \mu$
$15\lambda = 9 - 15\lambda \implies 30\lambda = 9 \implies \lambda = \frac{9}{30} = \frac{3}{10}$
So, $\lambda = \mu = \frac{3}{10}$.
$\vec{P} = \frac{3}{10} (15, 8) = (\frac{45}{10}, \frac{24}{10}) = (\frac{9}{2}, \frac{12}{5})$. This confirms the coordinates of $P$.

$\vec{Q} = (1-\alpha)(9,0) + \alpha (15, 8) = ((1-\alpha)9 + 15\alpha, 8\alpha) = (9 - 9\alpha + 15\alpha, 8\alpha) = (9 + 6\alpha, 8\alpha)$
$\vec{Q} = (1-\beta)(0,0) + \beta (-6, 8) = (-6\beta, 8\beta)$
Equating components:
$8\alpha = 8\beta \implies \alpha = \beta$
$9 + 6\alpha = -6\alpha \implies 12\alpha = -9 \implies \alpha = -\frac{9}{12} = -\frac{3}{4}$.
This negative value indicates an issue. The intersection point should lie on the segments.

Let's reconsider the order of vertices.
The intersection is bounded by segments of the sides.

Consider the equations of the lines again.
Line $BC: y = \frac{4}{3}x - 12$ for $9 \le x \le 15$.
Line $AD: y = -\frac{4}{3}x$ for $-6 \le x \le 0$.

If the intersection point $Q$ exists, its x-coordinate must satisfy both ranges.
Intersection point of lines $BC$ and $AD$ had $x = \frac{9}{2}$.
For line $BC$, $9 \le \frac{9}{2} \le 15$, which is false ($4.5$).
For line $AD$, $-6 \le \frac{9}{2} \le 0$, which is false.
The line segments $BC$ and $AD$ do not intersect.

The intersection polygon has vertices $A, B$, and the intersection point $P$ of $AC$ and $BD$.
The shape of the intersection is $\triangle ABP$.

Area of $\triangle ABP$ with vertices $A=(0,0), B=(9,0), P=(\frac{9}{2}, \frac{12}{5})$.
We can use the determinant formula for area:
Area = $\frac{1}{2} |x_A(y_B - y_P) + x_B(y_P - y_A) + x_P(y_A - y_B)|$
Area = $\frac{1}{2} |0(0 - \frac{12}{5}) + 9(\frac{12}{5} - 0) + \frac{9}{2}(0 - 0)|$
Area = $\frac{1}{2} |0 + 9 \times \frac{12}{5} + 0| = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{108}{5} = \frac{54}{5}$.

If the intersection is $\triangle ABP$, then the vertices of intersection are $A, B, P$.
The sides of the intersection are $AB$, the segment of $AC$ from $A$ to $P$, and the segment of $BD$ from $B$ to $P$.

Let's check the geometry again. The intersection is a region contained within both triangles.

Consider the vertices of the intersection polygon. These are the original vertices that lie in the other triangle.
Does $A$ of $\triangle ABC$ lie in $\triangle BAD$? Yes, trivially.
Does $B$ of $\triangle ABC$ lie in $\triangle BAD$? Yes, trivially.
Does $C$ of $\triangle ABC$ lie in $\triangle BAD$? We need to check if $C$ is on the correct side of lines $BA, AD, DB$.

Equation of line $BA$: $y = 0$. $C=(15,8)$ is above the line.
Equation of line $AD$: $4x + 3y = 0$. For $C=(15,8)$, $4(15) + 3(8) = 60 + 24 = 84 > 0$.
The region of $\triangle BAD$ is where $4x + 3y \le 0$. So $C$ is not in $\triangle BAD$.

Does $D$ of $\triangle BAD$ lie in $\triangle ABC$?
Equation of line $AB$: $y = 0$. $D=(-6,8)$ is above the line.
Equation of line $BC$: $4x - 3y - 36 = 0$. For $D=(-6,8)$, $4(-6) - 3(8) - 36 = -24 - 24 - 36 = -84 < 0$.
The region of $\triangle ABC$ is where $4x - 3y - 36 \le 0$. So $D$ satisfies this.
Equation of line $CA$: $8x - 15y = 0$. For $D=(-6,8)$, $8(-6) - 15(8) = -48 - 120 = -168 < 0$.
The region of $\triangle ABC$ is where $8x - 15y \ge 0$. So $D$ is not in $\triangle ABC$.

The vertices of the intersection polygon are $A, B, P$.
The intersection is $\triangle ABP$.

Let's verify the intersection logic. The intersection of two convex polygons is a convex polygon. The vertices of the intersection polygon are either vertices of the original polygons or intersection points of the edges.

Vertices of $\triangle ABC$: $A, B, C$.
Vertices of $\triangle BAD$: $A, B, D$.
Possible vertices of the intersection: $A, B$, and intersections of edges.
Intersection of $AC$ and $BD$: $P$.
Intersection of $AC$ and $AB$: $A$.
Intersection of $AC$ and $AD$: $A$.
Intersection of $AC$ and $BA$: $A$.

Intersection of $BC$ and $BD$: $B$.
Intersection of $BC$ and $AB$: $B$.
Intersection of $BC$ and $AD$: No intersection.

The vertices of the intersection polygon are $A, B, P$. The intersection is $\triangle ABP$.

Area of $\triangle ABP = \frac{54}{5}$.
The area is $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{54}{5}$.
$m = 54, n = 5$.
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime: gcd(54, 5) = 1.
$m+n = 54 + 5 = 59$.

Final check: The problem statement ensures the intersection is non-empty.
The intersection consists of points that belong to both triangles.

The intersection polygon has vertices $A, B$, and the intersection of the non-common sides.
The non-common sides are $AC, BC$ of $\triangle ABC$ and $AD, BD$ of $\triangle BAD$.
Intersection of $AC$ and $BD$ is $P$.
Intersection of $BC$ and $AD$: No intersection.

The intersection is bounded by segments $AP$ of $AC$, $BP$ of $BD$, and $AB$.
The intersection is $\triangle ABP$.

Equation of line $AD$: $4x + 3y = 0$. For $C=(15,8)$, $4(15) + 3(8) = 60 + 24 = 84 > 0$.
The region of $\triangle BAD$ is where $4x + 3y \le 0$. So $C$ is not in $\triangle BAD$.</text>

<text>Does $D$ of $\triangle BAD$ lie in $\triangle ABC$?
Equation of line $AB$: $y = 0$. $D=(-6,8)$ is above the line.
Equation of line $BC$: $4x - 3y - 36 = 0$. For $D=(-6,8)$, $4(-6) - 3(8) - 36 = -24 - 24 - 36 = -84 < 0$.
The region of $\triangle ABC$ is where $4x - 3y - 36 \le 0$. So $D$ satisfies this.
Equation of line $CA$: $8x - 15y = 0$. For $D=(-6,8)$, $8(-6) - 15(8) = -48 - 120 = -168 < 0$.
The region of $\triangle ABC$ is where $8x - 15y \ge 0$. So $D$ is not in $\triangle ABC$.</text>
<explanation>The solver continues applying half-plane tests to determine whether points lie inside triangles, demonstrating geometric reasoning about the relationships between points and regions defined by lines.</explanation>

<text>Area of $\triangle ABP$ with vertices $A=(0,0), B=(9,0), P=(\frac{9}{2}, \frac{12}{5})$.
We can use the determinant formula for area:
Area = $\frac{1}{2} |x_A(y_B - y_P) + x_B(y_P - y_A) + x_P(y_A - y_B)|$
Area = $\frac{1}{2} |0(0 - \frac{12}{5}) + 9(\frac{12}{5} - 0) + \frac{9}{2}(0 - 0)|$
Area = $\frac{1}{2} |0 + 9 \times \frac{12}{5} + 0| = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{108}{5} = \frac{54}{5}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the determinant formula to calculate the area of a triangle given the coordinates of its vertices, demonstrating knowledge of area calculation techniques for polygons in a coordinate system.</explanation>
