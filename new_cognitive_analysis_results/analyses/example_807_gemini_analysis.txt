Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
The problem asks for the Binormal vector of a given vector function r(t). The binormal vector B is defined as the cross product of the unit tangent vector T and the unit normal vector N, i.e., B = T x N.

First, find the tangent vector r'(t).
r(t) = (6t+2)i + 5t^2j - 8tk
r'(t) = d/dt (6t+2)i + d/dt (5t^2)j - d/dt (8t)k
r'(t) = 6i + 10tj - 8k

Next, find the unit tangent vector T(t) = r'(t) / |r'(t)|.
|r'(t)| = sqrt(6^2 + (10t)^2 + (-8)^2)
|r'(t)| = sqrt(36 + 100t^2 + 64)
|r'(t)| = sqrt(100t^2 + 100)
|r'(t)| = sqrt(100(t^2 + 1))
|r'(t)| = 10 sqrt(t^2 + 1)
T(t) = (6i + 10tj - 8k) / (10 sqrt(t^2 + 1))
T(t) = (3 / (5 sqrt(t^2 + 1)))i + (t / sqrt(t^2 + 1))j - (4 / (5 sqrt(t^2 + 1)))k

Next, find the derivative of the unit tangent vector T'(t).
Let u = (t^2 + 1)^(-1/2)
dT/dt = d/dt [3/5 * u * i + t * u * j - 4/5 * u * k]
dT/dt = 3/5 * (-1/2) * (t^2 + 1)^(-3/2) * 2t * i + [1 * u + t * (-1/2) * (t^2 + 1)^(-3/2) * 2t] * j - 4/5 * (-1/2) * (t^2 + 1)^(-3/2) * 2t * k
dT/dt = -3t / (5 (t^2 + 1)^(3/2)) i + [(t^2 + 1)^(-1/2) - t^2 / (t^2 + 1)^(3/2)] j + 4t / (5 (t^2 + 1)^(3/2)) k
dT/dt = -3t / (5 (t^2 + 1)^(3/2)) i + [(t^2 + 1 - t^2) / (t^2 + 1)^(3/2)] j + 4t / (5 (t^2 + 1)^(3/2)) k
dT/dt = -3t / (5 (t^2 + 1)^(3/2)) i + 1 / (t^2 + 1)^(3/2) j + 4t / (5 (t^2 + 1)^(3/2)) k

Next, find the unit normal vector N(t) = T'(t) / |T'(t)|.
|T'(t)| = sqrt((-3t / (5 (t^2 + 1)^(3/2)))^2 + (1 / (t^2 + 1)^(3/2))^2 + (4t / (5 (t^2 + 1)^(3/2)))^2)
|T'(t)| = sqrt((9t^2 / (25 (t^2 + 1)^3)) + (1 / (t^2 + 1)^3) + (16t^2 / (25 (t^2 + 1)^3)))
|T'(t)| = sqrt((9t^2 + 25 + 16t^2) / (25 (t^2 + 1)^3))
|T'(t)| = sqrt((25t^2 + 25) / (25 (t^2 + 1)^3))
|T'(t)| = sqrt((25(t^2 + 1)) / (25 (t^2 + 1)^3))
|T'(t)| = sqrt(1 / (t^2 + 1)^2)
|T'(t)| = 1 / (t^2 + 1)
N(t) = T'(t) / |T'(t)| = [-3t / (5 (t^2 + 1)^(3/2)) i + 1 / (t^2 + 1)^(3/2) j + 4t / (5 (t^2 + 1)^(3/2)) k] / [1 / (t^2 + 1)]
N(t) = [-3t / (5 sqrt(t^2 + 1))] i + [1 / sqrt(t^2 + 1)] j + [4t / (5 sqrt(t^2 + 1))] k

Finally, find the binormal vector B(t) = T(t) x N(t).
T(t) = (3 / (5 sqrt(t^2 + 1)))i + (t / sqrt(t^2 + 1))j - (4 / (5 sqrt(t^2 + 1)))k
N(t) = (-3t / (5 sqrt(t^2 + 1))) i + (1 / sqrt(t^2 + 1)) j + (4t / (5 sqrt(t^2 + 1))) k
B(t) = | i     j     k   |
       | 3/(5s) t/s   -4/(5s) |
       | -3t/(5s) 1/s  4t/(5s) |
where s = sqrt(t^2 + 1)
B(t) = i * ( (t/s) * (4t/(5s)) - (-4/(5s)) * (1/s) ) - j * ( (3/(5s)) * (4t/(5s)) - (-4/(5s)) * (-3t/(5s)) ) + k * ( (3/(5s)) * (1/s) - (t/s) * (-3t/(5s)) )
B(t) = i * ( 4t^2/(5s^2) + 4/(5s^2) ) - j * ( 12t/(25s^2) - 12t/(25s^2) ) + k * ( 3/(5s^2) + 3t^2/(5s^2) )
B(t) = i * ( 4(t^2 + 1)/(5(t^2 + 1)) ) - j * ( 0 ) + k * ( 3(1 + t^2)/(5(t^2 + 1)) )
B(t) = i * ( 4/5 ) - j * ( 0 ) + k * ( 3/5 )
B(t) = (4/5)i + 0j + (3/5)k

So, x = 4/5, y = 0, z = 3/5.
