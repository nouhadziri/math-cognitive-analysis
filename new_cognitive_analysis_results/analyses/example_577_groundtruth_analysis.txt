all  $x\in G$ . Prove that either  $f(x)=x$  for all  $x\in G$ , or  $f(x)=x^{-1}$ for all  $x\in G$ .

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Assume Definitions and Initial Setup:**
   Let \( (G, \cdot) \) be a group with no elements of order 4, and let \( f: G \rightarrow G \) be a group homomorphism such that \( f(x) \in \{x, x^{-1}\} \) for all \( x \in G \).

2. **Define Subsets:**
   Define the subsets:
   \[
   S_1 = \{ x \in G \mid f(x) = x \}
   \]
   \[
   S_2 = \{ y \in G \mid o(y) \neq 2 \text{ and } f(y) = y^{-1} \}
   \]

3. **Consider Elements in \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \):**
   Take \( x \in S_1 \) and \( y \in S_2 \). Then \( f(x) = x \) and \( f(y) = y^{-1} \).

4. **Evaluate \( f(xy) \):**
   Since \( f \) is a homomorphism:
   \[
   f(xy) = f(x)f(y) = xy^{-1}
   \]
   Since \( f(xy) \) must be either \( xy \) or \( (xy)^{-1} \), and \( xy^{-1} \neq xy \) (as \( y \neq y^{-1} \)), it must be that:
   \[
   f(xy) = (xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   xyx = y
   \]

5. **Consider the Implications:**
   From \( xyx = y \), we have:
   \[
   xyx = y \implies xy = yx
   \]
   This shows that \( x \) and \( y \) commute.

6. **Consider Elements in \( S_2 \):**
   Take \( a, b \in S_2 \). Then:
   \[
   f(ab) = (ab)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}
   \]
   Since \( f \) is a homomorphism:
   \[
   f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = a^{-1}b^{-1}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   ab = ba
   \]
   Thus, elements of \( S_2 \) commute with each other.

7. **Evaluate \( ab \in S_1 \):**
   If \( ab \in S_1 \), then:
   \[
   f(ab) = ab = a^{-1}b^{-1}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   a^2b^2 = e
   \]

8. **Consider \( y, z \in S_2 \) and \( x \in S_1 \) with \( o(x) \neq 2 \):**
   If \( yz \in S_2 \), then:
   \[
   x(yz)x = yz \implies yx^2z = yz \implies o(x) = 2
   \]
   This is a contradiction since \( o(x) \neq 2 \).

9. **Conclude \( S_2 \) Properties:**
   Therefore, there cannot exist such \( y, z \in S_2 \). Consequently, \( a^2b^2 = e \) for all \( a, b \in S_2 \).

10. **Consider the Size of \( S_2 \):**
    If \( |S_2| > 3 \), then:
    \[
    a^2b^2 = b^2c^2 = c^2a^2 = e \implies a^4 = e \implies o(a) = 4
    \]
    This is a contradiction since \( G \) has no elements of order 4.

11. **Consider \( |S_2| = 3 \):**
    If \( |S_2| = 3 \), let \( a \neq b \neq e \in S_2 \) with \( a^2b^2 = e \). At least one of \( xa \) or \( xb \) cannot be in \( S_2 \). Without loss of generality, assume \( xa \notin S_2 \). Then:
    \[
    (xa)^2 = xaxa = a^2 = e
    \]
    This is a contradiction.

12. **Conclude \( S_1 \) or \( S_2 \):**
    Therefore, we must have either \( |S_1| \) or \( |S_2| = 1 \).

13. **Final Conclusion:**
    Since \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) partition \( G \), and \( |S_2| = 1 \) implies \( f(x) = x^{-1} \) for all \( x \in G \), we conclude that either \( f(x) = x \) for all \( x \in G \) or \( f(x) = x^{-1} \) for all \( x \in G \).
