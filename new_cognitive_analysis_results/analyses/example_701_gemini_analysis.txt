Problem:
A load dissipates 1.5kW of power in an ac series RC circuit. Given that the power factor is 0.75, what is its reactive power $(P_r)$? What is its apparent power $(P_a)$? Represent the answer in a list [$P_r, P_a$] with unit kVA and kVAR respectively.

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let the real power be P, the reactive power be Pr, and the apparent power be Pa.
The power factor (PF) is defined as the ratio of real power to apparent power:
PF = P / Pa

Given P = 1.5 kW and PF = 0.75.
We can find the apparent power Pa:
Pa = P / PF
Pa = 1.5 kW / 0.75
Pa = 2 kVA

The relationship between real power, reactive power, and apparent power is given by the power triangle:
Pa^2 = P^2 + Pr^2

We can solve for the reactive power Pr:
Pr^2 = Pa^2 - P^2
Pr^2 = (2 kVA)^2 - (1.5 kW)^2
Pr^2 = 4 - 2.25
Pr^2 = 1.75
Pr = sqrt(1.75)

Calculate the square root of 1.75:
Pr ≈ 1.32287 kVAR

The question asks to represent the answer in a list [$P_r, P_a$] with units kVAR and kVA respectively.
So the list will be [Pr, Pa] = [sqrt(1.75), 2].

Let's verify the units. Real power is in kW, apparent power is in kVA, and reactive power is in kVAR. The question asks for units of kVAR for Pr and kVA for Pa.

Final Answer: The final answer should be a list with two values.
Pr = sqrt(1.75) kVAR
Pa = 2 kVA

Convert sqrt(1.75) to decimal to a reasonable number of decimal places.
sqrt(1.75) ≈ 1.32

The list should be [Pr, Pa] = [1.32, 2].

Let's double check the calculations.
Pa = P / PF = 1.5 / 0.75 = 2 kVA
Pr = sqrt(Pa^2 - P^2) = sqrt(2^2 - 1.5^2) = sqrt(4 - 2.25) = sqrt(1.75) kVAR
sqrt(1.75) ≈ 1.3228756555

Round to a reasonable number of decimal places, let's use two decimal places.
Pr ≈ 1.32 kVAR
Pa = 2 kVA

The answer should be in the format [$P_r$, $P_a$].
