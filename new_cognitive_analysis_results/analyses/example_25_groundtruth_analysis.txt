Problem:
The path of an asteroid that comes close to the Earth can be modeled as follows: neglect gravitational effects due to other bodies, and assume the asteroid comes in from far away with some speed $v$ and lever arm distance $r$ to Earth's center. On January 26, 2023, a small asteroid called 2023 BU came to a close distance of $3541 \mathrm{~km}$ to Earth's surface with a speed of $9300 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Although BU had a very small mass estimated to be about $300,000 \mathrm{~kg}$, if it was much more massive, it could have hit the Earth. How massive would BU have had to have been to make contact with the Earth? Express your answer in scientific notation with 3 significant digits. Use $6357 \mathrm{~km}$ as the radius of the Earth. The parameters that remain constant when the asteroid mass changes are $v$ and $r$, where $v$ is the speed at infinity and $r$ is the impact parameter.

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Let $v_{1}=9300 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, d=3541 \mathrm{~km}$, and $m=300,000 \mathrm{~kg}$, and let $M$ and $R$ be the Earth's mass and radius.

First we find $v$ and $r$. We use the reference frame of the Earth, where the asteroid has reduced mass $\mu=\frac{M m}{M+m}$ and the Earth has mass $M+m$. Then by energy and angular momentum conservation, we have

$$
\mu v r=\mu v_{1}(R+d)
$$



and

$$
\frac{1}{2} \mu v^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \mu v_{1}^{2}-\frac{G M m}{R+d}
$$

We solve for

$$
v=\sqrt{2 G(M+m) \cdot \frac{R+d}{r^{2}-(R+d)^{2}}}
$$

so

$$
v_{1}=\sqrt{\frac{2 G(M+m)}{R+d} \cdot \frac{r^{2}}{r^{2}-(R+d)^{2}}},
$$

and we compute $r=37047 \mathrm{~km}$ and $v=2490 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

Now we consider when the asteroid is massive enough to touch the Earth. We let $m^{\prime}$ and $\mu^{\prime}$ be the mass of the asteroid and its reduced mass, and using a similar method to above, we arrive at

$$
v=\sqrt{2 G\left(M+m^{\prime}\right) \cdot \frac{R}{r^{2}-R^{2}}}
$$

so we can solve for $m^{\prime}=3.74 \times 10^{24} \mathrm{~kg}$.
