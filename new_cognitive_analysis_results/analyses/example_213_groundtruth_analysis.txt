<end>4</end>
<text>True</text>
<explanation>The solver correctly answers the question, demonstrating knowledge of a key theorem in group theory: that a group whose order is a product of distinct primes must be cyclic and therefore abelian. This requires understanding the relationship between a group's order and its structure.</explanation>

<definition>Ability to identify and correctly apply relevant theorems to solve a mathematical problem.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>4</end>
<text>True</text>
<explanation>The solver applies (implicitly) a fundamental theorem of group theory stating that if the order of a group is a product of distinct primes, then the group must be cyclic. This requires recognizing which theorem is applicable to the given problem.</explanation>

<definition>Checking that the conditions of a theorem are satisfied before applying it to reach a conclusion.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>4</end>
<text>True</text>
<explanation>The solver has verified (implicitly) that 5, 7, and 47 are all distinct primes and that their product equals 1645, confirming that the conditions for the relevant theorem are met.</explanation>

<definition>The ability to make logical deductions based on mathematical principles and properties.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>4</end>
<text>True</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates mathematical reasoning by correctly deducing that since 1645 is a product of distinct primes, any group of this order must be cyclic (and therefore abelian), leading to the correct answer of "True".</explanation>
