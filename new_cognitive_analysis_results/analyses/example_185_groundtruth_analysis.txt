Problem:
For a permutation $\sigma$ of $1,2, \ldots, 7$, a transposition is a swapping of two elements. Let $f(\sigma)$ be the minimum number of transpositions necessary to turn $\sigma$ into the permutation $1,2,3,4,5,6,7$. Find the sum of $f(\sigma)$ over all permutations $\sigma$ of $1,2, \ldots, 7$.

Domain: Combinatorics

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
To solve this problem, we use the idea of a cycle in a permutation. If $\sigma$ is a permutation, we say that $\left(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{k}\right)$ is a cycle if $\sigma\left(a_{i}\right)=\sigma\left(a_{i+1}\right)$ for $1 \leq i \leq k-1$ and $\sigma\left(a_{k}\right)=a_{1}$. Any permutation can be decomposed into disjoint cycles; for instance, the permutation $3,7,6,4,5,1,2$, can be written as $(136)(27)(4)(5)$. For a permutation $\sigma$, let $g(\sigma)$ be the number of cycles in its cycle decomposition. Claim: For any permutation $\sigma$ on $n$ elements, $f(\sigma)=n-g(\sigma)$. Proof: Given a cycle $\left(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{k}\right)$ (with $\left.k \geq 2\right)$ of a permutation $\sigma$, we can turn this cycle into the identity permutation with $k-1$ transpositions; first we swap $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$. Now, for any $\sigma$, we resolve each cycle in this way, making a total of $n-g(\sigma)$ transpositions, to turn $\sigma$ into the identity permutation. Thus, we want to find $\sum_{\sigma \in S_{7}}(7-g(\sigma))=7 \cdot 7!-\sum_{\sigma \in S_{7}} g(\sigma)$. For any $1 \leq k \leq 7$, the number of cycles of size $k$ is $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k}$, and the number of permutations each such cycle can appear in is $(n-k)$!. Thus we get that the answer is $7 \cdot 7!-\sum_{k=1}^{7} \frac{7!}{k}=22212$.
