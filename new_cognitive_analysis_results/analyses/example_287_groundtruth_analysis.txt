Problem:
Let  $A$  be a finite ring and  $a,b \in A,$  such that  $(ab-1)b=0.$  Prove that  $b(ab-1)=0.$ 

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Given Condition:**
   We start with the given condition \((ab - 1)b = 0\). This implies:
   \[
   ab^2 - b = 0 \implies ab^2 = b
   \]

2. **Generalization for Positive Integers \(k\):**
   We claim that for all positive integers \(k\), \(a^k b^{k+1} = b\). We will prove this by induction.

   - **Base Case:**
     For \(k = 1\), we have:
     \[
     a^1 b^{1+1} = ab^2 = b
     \]
     which is true by the given condition.

   - **Inductive Step:**
     Assume that for some \(k = m\), \(a^m b^{m+1} = b\). We need to show that \(a^{m+1} b^{m+2} = b\).

     Using the inductive hypothesis:
     \[
     a^{m+1} b^{m+2} = a \cdot a^m b^{m+2} = a \cdot b = b
     \]
     Thus, by induction, \(a^k b^{k+1} = b\) holds for all positive integers \(k\).

3. **Finite Set and Cyclic Group:**
   Since \(A\) is a finite ring, the set \(\{b, b^2, b^3, \ldots\}\) is also finite. Therefore, there exist positive integers \(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\) with \(\beta_1 < \beta_2\) such that:
   \[
   b^{\beta_1} = b^{\beta_2}
   \]
   Let \(n = \beta_2 - \beta_1\) be the minimal positive integer such that \(b^{\beta_1} = b^{\beta_1 + n}\). Then:
   \[
   b = b^{\beta_1} = b^{\beta_1 + n} = b \cdot b^n
   \]
   Let \(e_b = b^n\). By the minimality of \(n\), the elements \(e_b, b, b^2, \ldots, b^{n-1}\) are distinct. Thus, the set \(\{e_b, b, b^2, \ldots, b^{n-1}\}\) forms a cyclic group of order \(n\).

4. **Using the Cyclic Group Property:**
   Since \(e_b = b^n\) is the identity element in this cyclic group, we have:
   \[
   ab = ab^{n+1} = b^n
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   b(ab - 1) = b \cdot ab - b = b^n - b = 0
   \]

Thus, we have proved that \(b(ab - 1) = 0\).

<text>1. **Given Condition:**
   We start with the given condition \((ab - 1)b = 0\). This implies:
   \[
   ab^2 - b = 0 \implies ab^2 = b
   \]

2. **Generalization for Positive Integers \(k\):**
   We claim that for all positive integers \(k\), \(a^k b^{k+1} = b\). We will prove this by induction.

   - **Base Case:**
     For \(k = 1\), we have:
     \[
     a^1 b^{1+1} = ab^2 = b
     \]
     which is true by the given condition.

   - **Inductive Step:**
     Assume that for some \(k = m\), \(a^m b^{m+1} = b\). We need to show that \(a^{m+1} b^{m+2} = b\).

     Using the inductive hypothesis:
     \[
     a^{m+1} b^{m+2} = a \cdot a^m b^{m+2} = a \cdot b = b

     Thus, by induction, \(a^k b^{k+1} = b\) holds for all positive integers \(k\).

3. **Finite Set and Cyclic Group:**
   Since \(A\) is a finite ring, the set \(\{b, b^2, b^3, \ldots\}\) is also finite. Therefore, there exist positive integers \(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\) with \(\beta_1 < \beta_2\) such that:
   \[
   b^{\beta_1} = b^{\beta_2}
   \]
   Let \(n = \beta_2 - \beta_1\) be the minimal positive integer such that \(b^{\beta_1} = b^{\beta_1 + n}\). Then:
   \[
   b = b^{\beta_1} = b^{\beta_1 + n} = b \cdot b^n
   \]
   Let \(e_b = b^n\). By the minimality of \(n\), the elements \(e_b, b, b^2, \ldots, b^{n-1}\) are distinct. Thus, the set \(\{e_b, b, b^2, \ldots, b^{n-1}\}\) forms a cyclic group of order \(n\).

4. **Using the Cyclic Group Property:**
   Since \(e_b = b^n\) is the identity element in this cyclic group, we have:
   \[
   ab = ab^{n+1} = b^n
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   b(ab - 1) = b \cdot ab - b = b^n - b = 0
   \]

Thus, we have proved that \(b(ab - 1) = 0\).</text>
