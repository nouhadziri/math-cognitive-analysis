Problem:
ii. Estimate the time $t_{2}$ needed for the radius to shrink from $r_{0}$ to $r_{2}=0.95 r_{0}$. Neglect the change of the gravity field at the position of a falling gas particle.

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
The problem refers to a previous part, let's denote it as part i. In part i, we derived the differential equation for the radius of the gas cloud as a function of time: $\frac{dr}{dt} = - \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R_0}} \sqrt{\frac{R_0}{r} - 1}$. We need to find the time $t_2$ it takes for the radius to shrink from $r_0$ to $r_2 = 0.95 r_0$.

We have the differential equation:
$\frac{dr}{dt} = - \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R_0}} \sqrt{\frac{R_0}{r} - 1}$

Let $C = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R_0}}$, which is a constant. The equation becomes:
$\frac{dr}{dt} = - C \sqrt{\frac{R_0}{r} - 1}$

We need to integrate this equation with respect to time to find the relationship between $r$ and $t$. We can rearrange the equation to separate variables:
$\frac{dr}{\sqrt{\frac{R_0}{r} - 1}} = -C dt$

Integrate both sides. The integration limits for $r$ are from $r_0$ to $r_2 = 0.95 r_0$, and for $t$ are from $0$ to $t_2$.
$\int_{r_0}^{0.95 r_0} \frac{dr}{\sqrt{\frac{R_0}{r} - 1}} = \int_{0}^{t_2} -C dt$

Let's evaluate the integral on the left side:
$I = \int_{r_0}^{0.95 r_0} \frac{dr}{\sqrt{\frac{R_0}{r} - 1}} = \int_{r_0}^{0.95 r_0} \frac{dr}{\sqrt{\frac{R_0 - r}{r}}} = \int_{r_0}^{0.95 r_0} \sqrt{\frac{r}{R_0 - r}} dr$

Let $r = R_0 \sin^2 \theta$. Then $dr = 2 R_0 \sin \theta \cos \theta d\theta$.
When $r = r_0$, $r_0 = R_0 \sin^2 \theta_1$, $\sin \theta_1 = \sqrt{r_0/R_0}$.
When $r = 0.95 r_0$, $0.95 r_0 = R_0 \sin^2 \theta_2$, $\sin \theta_2 = \sqrt{0.95 r_0/R_0}$.
$R_0 - r = R_0 - R_0 \sin^2 \theta = R_0 (1 - \sin^2 \theta) = R_0 \cos^2 \theta$.

The integral becomes:
$I = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \sqrt{\frac{R_0 \sin^2 \theta}{R_0 \cos^2 \theta}} 2 R_0 \sin \theta \cos \theta d\theta = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} 2 R_0 \sin \theta \cos \theta d\theta$
$I = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} 2 R_0 \sin^2 \theta d\theta = 2 R_0 \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \frac{1 - \cos 2\theta}{2} d\theta = R_0 \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} (1 - \cos 2\theta) d\theta$
$I = R_0 [\theta - \frac{1}{2} \sin 2\theta]_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} = R_0 [(\theta_2 - \theta_1) - \frac{1}{2} (\sin 2\theta_2 - \sin 2\theta_1)]$
$I = R_0 [(\theta_2 - \theta_1) - (\sin \theta_2 \cos \theta_2 - \sin \theta_1 \cos \theta_1)]$

This looks complicated. Let's reconsider the integral with the given limits.

$\int_{r_0}^{0.95 r_0} \sqrt{\frac{r}{R_0 - r}} dr = -C \int_{0}^{t_2} dt = -C t_2$

The limits of integration for $r$ are from $r_0$ to $0.95 r_0$. Since the radius is shrinking, $dr$ is negative. The LHS should be negative, and the RHS is also negative.

Let's change the limits of integration:
$\int_{0.95 r_0}^{r_0} \sqrt{\frac{r}{R_0 - r}} dr = C t_2$

Consider the case when $r_0 \approx R_0$. In that case, $\sqrt{\frac{r}{R_0 - r}}$ is large.
However, the problem statement does not specify this condition.

Let's use a more direct approach. Assume $r$ is close to $r_0$.
$\frac{dr}{dt} = - \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R_0}} \sqrt{\frac{R_0}{r} - 1}$
When $r$ is close to $r_0$, let $r = r_0 - \delta r$, where $\delta r$ is small and positive.
$\frac{R_0}{r} - 1 = \frac{R_0}{r_0 - \delta r} - 1 = \frac{R_0 - (r_0 - \delta r)}{r_0 - \delta r} = \frac{R_0 - r_0 + \delta r}{r_0 - \delta r}$
If $R_0 = r_0$, then $\frac{\delta r}{r_0 - \delta r} \approx \frac{\delta r}{r_0}$.
This approximation assumes $R_0 \approx r_0$. However, $R_0$ is the initial radius, which is $r_0$. So, this is the case at the beginning.

The original differential equation was derived based on the condition that a particle falls from the surface $R_0$ to radius $r$.

Let's go back to the integrated form:
$\int_{0.95 r_0}^{r_0} \frac{dr}{\sqrt{\frac{R_0}{r} - 1}} = C t_2$

We are given that the change in the gravity field is negligible. This means we can use the result from part i.

Consider the integrand near $r = r_0$. Let $r = r_0 - \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is small and positive.
$\sqrt{\frac{R_0}{r} - 1} = \sqrt{\frac{R_0}{r_0 - \epsilon} - 1} = \sqrt{\frac{R_0 - (r_0 - \epsilon)}{r_0 - \epsilon}} = \sqrt{\frac{R_0 - r_0 + \epsilon}{r_0 - \epsilon}}$
At the start, $R_0 = r_0$, so $\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{r_0 - \epsilon}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{r_0}}$.

Let's reconsider the differential equation:
$\frac{dr}{dt} = - \sqrt{2GM} \sqrt{\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_0}}$ (This is the equation from part i)

Now, integrate this from $r=r_0$ at $t=0$ to $r=0.95 r_0$ at $t=t_2$.
$\int_{r_0}^{0.95 r_0} \frac{dr}{-\sqrt{2GM} \sqrt{\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_0}}} = \int_{0}^{t_2} dt$
$t_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2GM}} \int_{0.95 r_0}^{r_0} \frac{dr}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_0}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2GM}} \int_{0.95 r_0}^{r_0} \frac{dr}{\sqrt{\frac{R_0 - r}{r R_0}}} = \frac{\sqrt{R_0}}{\sqrt{2GM}} \int_{0.95 r_0}^{r_0} \sqrt{\frac{r}{R_0 - r}} dr$

Let $r = R_0 \sin^2 \theta$. $dr = 2 R_0 \sin \theta \cos \theta d\theta$.
When $r = 0.95 r_0$, $0.95 r_0 = R_0 \sin^2 \theta_1$, $\sin \theta_1 = \sqrt{0.95 r_0 / R_0}$.
When $r = r_0$, $r_0 = R_0 \sin^2 \theta_2$, $\sin \theta_2 = \sqrt{r_0 / R_0} = 1$, so $\theta_2 = \pi/2$.
$R_0 - r = R_0 \cos^2 \theta$.
$\sqrt{\frac{r}{R_0 - r}} = \sqrt{\frac{R_0 \sin^2 \theta}{R_0 \cos^2 \theta}} = \tan \theta$.

$t_2 = \frac{\sqrt{R_0}}{\sqrt{2GM}} \int_{\arcsin(\sqrt{0.95 r_0 / R_0})}^{\pi/2} \tan \theta \cdot 2 R_0 \sin \theta \cos \theta d\theta$
$t_2 = \frac{2 R_0 \sqrt{R_0}}{\sqrt{2GM}} \int_{\arcsin(\sqrt{0.95 r_0 / R_0})}^{\pi/2} \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \sin \theta \cos \theta d\theta$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 R_0^3}{GM}} \int_{\arcsin(\sqrt{0.95 r_0 / R_0})}^{\pi/2} \sin^2 \theta d\theta$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 R_0^3}{GM}} \int_{\arcsin(\sqrt{0.95 r_0 / R_0})}^{\pi/2} \frac{1 - \cos 2\theta}{2} d\theta$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{R_0^3}{2GM}} [\theta - \frac{1}{2} \sin 2\theta]_{\arcsin(\sqrt{0.95 r_0 / R_0})}^{\pi/2}$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{R_0^3}{2GM}} [(\frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin(\sqrt{0.95 r_0 / R_0})) - \frac{1}{2} (\sin \pi - \sin(2 \arcsin(\sqrt{0.95 r_0 / R_0})))]$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{R_0^3}{2GM}} [\arccos(\sqrt{0.95 r_0 / R_0}) - \frac{1}{2} (0 - 2 \sin(\arcsin(\sqrt{0.95 r_0 / R_0})) \cos(\arcsin(\sqrt{0.95 r_0 / R_0})))]$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{R_0^3}{2GM}} [\arccos(\sqrt{0.95 r_0 / R_0}) + \sqrt{0.95 r_0 / R_0} \sqrt{1 - 0.95 r_0 / R_0}]$

We need to consider the specific case where the radius shrinks from $r_0$. This implies the initial state. At the start, the radius is $R_0 = r_0$.

Substituting $R_0 = r_0$:
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{2GM}} [\arccos(\sqrt{0.95}) + \sqrt{0.95} \sqrt{1 - 0.95}]$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{2GM}} [\arccos(\sqrt{0.95}) + \sqrt{0.95} \sqrt{0.05}]$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{2GM}} [\arccos(0.9747) + \sqrt{0.0475}]$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{2GM}} [0.2257 + 0.2179]$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{2GM}} [0.4436]$

Alternative approach: Consider the velocity of a particle at the surface.
From part i, the speed of a particle falling from rest at $R_0$ to radius $r$ is $v = \sqrt{2GM (\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_0})}$.
The rate of change of the radius is the velocity of the particles at the surface.
$\frac{dr}{dt} = -v = - \sqrt{2GM (\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_0})}$
The negative sign indicates that the radius is decreasing.

We need to integrate this equation.
$\int_{r_0}^{0.95 r_0} \frac{dr}{-\sqrt{2GM (\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r_0})}} = \int_{0}^{t_2} dt$
$t_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2GM}} \int_{0.95 r_0}^{r_0} \frac{dr}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r_0}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2GM}} \int_{0.95 r_0}^{r_0} \sqrt{\frac{r r_0}{r_0 - r}} dr$
$t_2 = \frac{\sqrt{r_0}}{\sqrt{2GM}} \int_{0.95 r_0}^{r_0} \sqrt{\frac{r}{r_0 - r}} dr$

Let $r = r_0 \sin^2 \theta$. $dr = 2 r_0 \sin \theta \cos \theta d\theta$.
When $r = 0.95 r_0$, $0.95 r_0 = r_0 \sin^2 \theta_1$, $\sin \theta_1 = \sqrt{0.95}$.
When $r = r_0$, $r_0 = r_0 \sin^2 \theta_2$, $\sin \theta_2 = 1$, $\theta_2 = \pi/2$.
$r_0 - r = r_0 (1 - \sin^2 \theta) = r_0 \cos^2 \theta$.
$\sqrt{\frac{r}{r_0 - r}} = \sqrt{\frac{r_0 \sin^2 \theta}{r_0 \cos^2 \theta}} = \tan \theta$.

$t_2 = \frac{\sqrt{r_0}}{\sqrt{2GM}} \int_{\arcsin(\sqrt{0.95})}^{\pi/2} \tan \theta \cdot 2 r_0 \sin \theta \cos \theta d\theta$
$t_2 = \frac{2 r_0 \sqrt{r_0}}{\sqrt{2GM}} \int_{\arcsin(\sqrt{0.95})}^{\pi/2} \sin^2 \theta d\theta$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 r_0^3}{GM}} \int_{\arcsin(\sqrt{0.95})}^{\pi/2} \frac{1 - \cos 2\theta}{2} d\theta$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{2GM}} [\theta - \frac{1}{2} \sin 2\theta]_{\arcsin(\sqrt{0.95})}^{\pi/2}$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{2GM}} [(\frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin(\sqrt{0.95})) - \frac{1}{2} (\sin \pi - \sin(2 \arcsin(\sqrt{0.95})))]$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{2GM}} [\arccos(\sqrt{0.95}) - \frac{1}{2} (0 - 2 \sin(\arcsin(\sqrt{0.95})) \cos(\arcsin(\sqrt{0.95})))]$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{2GM}} [\arccos(\sqrt{0.95}) + \sqrt{0.95} \sqrt{1 - 0.95}]$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{2GM}} [\arccos(0.9747) + \sqrt{0.95} \sqrt{0.05}]$
$t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{2GM}} [0.2257 + 0.2179] = 0.4436 \sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{2GM}}$

Let's calculate the numerical value.
$\arccos(\sqrt{0.95}) = \arccos(0.974679) = 0.2257$ radians.
$\sqrt{0.95} \sqrt{0.05} = \sqrt{0.0475} = 0.2179$.
Sum = $0.4436$.

The time scale for the collapse is the free-fall time, which is of the order $\sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{GM}}$.

The question assumes that the formula from part i is applicable, where the particle starts from rest at the surface $R_0$. In this case, the initial radius is $r_0$, so $R_0 = r_0$.
The time derived is the time for the outer edge of the cloud to shrink.

Final check of the steps. The integration limits and the substitution seem correct. The use of the result from part i, where the gravity field change is neglected, justifies setting $R_0 = r_0$ in the velocity formula.
