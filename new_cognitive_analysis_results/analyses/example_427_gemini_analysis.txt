Problem:
Consider the natural implementation of computing Fibonacci numbers:

\begin{tabular}{l}
1: \textbf{FUNCTION}  $\text{FIB}(n)$ : 
2: $\qquad$  \textbf{IF}  $n = 0$  \textbf{OR}  $n = 1$  \textbf{RETURN} 1 
3: $\qquad$  \textbf{RETURN}  $\text{FIB}(n-1) + \text{FIB}(n-2)$ \end{tabular}

When  $\text{FIB}(10)$  is evaluated, how many recursive calls to  $\text{FIB}$  occur?

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let's analyze the input and the question.
The input is a recursive function for calculating Fibonacci numbers.
The question asks for the number of recursive calls to the FIB function when FIB(10) is evaluated.

Let's trace the execution for small values of n:
FIB(0): returns 1 (0 recursive calls)
FIB(1): returns 1 (0 recursive calls)
FIB(2): calls FIB(1) and FIB(0) (2 recursive calls)
FIB(3): calls FIB(2) and FIB(1)
       FIB(2) calls FIB(1) and FIB(0)
       FIB(1) returns 1
       Total recursive calls: 2 (from FIB(2)) + 0 (from FIB(1)) + 1 (for FIB(2)) = 3

Let C(n) be the number of recursive calls for FIB(n).
C(0) = 0
C(1) = 0
C(2) = C(1) + C(0) + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1  This is incorrect, let's rethink.

When FIB(n) is called, if n > 1, it calls FIB(n-1) and FIB(n-2).
The number of recursive calls for FIB(n) is the sum of the number of recursive calls for FIB(n-1) and FIB(n-2), plus 1 for the current call.

Let R(n) be the number of recursive calls for FIB(n).
R(0) = 0
R(1) = 0
R(2) = R(1) + R(0) + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
R(3) = R(2) + R(1) + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2
R(4) = R(3) + R(2) + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
R(5) = R(4) + R(3) + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

Let's trace the calls for FIB(4):
FIB(4)
  FIB(3)
    FIB(2)
      FIB(1)
      FIB(0)
    FIB(1)
  FIB(2)
    FIB(1)
    FIB(0)

The calls are: FIB(3), FIB(2), FIB(1), FIB(0), FIB(1), FIB(2), FIB(1), FIB(0).
Number of calls = 8. This is not matching R(4).

Let's rethink what a recursive call means. A recursive call occurs when the function calls itself.
When FIB(n) is evaluated, if n > 1, it makes two recursive calls: FIB(n-1) and FIB(n-2).

Let C(n) be the number of recursive calls when evaluating FIB(n).
C(0) = 0
C(1) = 0
C(2) = C(1) + C(0) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2
C(3) = C(2) + C(1) + 2 = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4
C(4) = C(3) + C(2) + 2 = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8
C(5) = C(4) + C(3) + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14

Let's go back to the trace of calls for FIB(4).
FIB(4) calls FIB(3) and FIB(2) (2 calls)
FIB(3) calls FIB(2) and FIB(1) (2 calls)
FIB(2) calls FIB(1) and FIB(0) (2 calls)
FIB(1) (base case) (0 calls)
FIB(0) (base case) (0 calls)
FIB(1) (base case) (0 calls)
FIB(2) calls FIB(1) and FIB(0) (2 calls)
FIB(1) (base case) (0 calls)
FIB(0) (base case) (0 calls)

The recursive calls are:
FIB(3)
FIB(2)
FIB(1)
FIB(0)
FIB(1)
FIB(2)
FIB(1)
FIB(0)
Number of recursive calls = 8.

Let C(n) be the number of recursive calls made when computing FIB(n).
If n = 0 or n = 1, C(n) = 0.
If n > 1, when we compute FIB(n), we make one call to FIB(n-1) and one call to FIB(n-2).
The number of recursive calls made by FIB(n-1) is C(n-1), and the number of recursive calls made by FIB(n-2) is C(n-2).
So, C(n) = 1 + C(n-1) + C(n-2).

C(0) = 0
C(1) = 0
C(2) = 1 + C(1) + C(0) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
C(3) = 1 + C(2) + C(1) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
C(4) = 1 + C(3) + C(2) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
C(5) = 1 + C(4) + C(3) = 1 + 4 + 2 = 7

This still doesn't match the manual trace.

Let's consider the number of function calls, including the initial call.
Let N(n) be the number of function calls to compute FIB(n).
N(0) = 1 (FIB(0))
N(1) = 1 (FIB(1))
N(2) = 1 (FIB(2)) + N(1) + N(0) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
N(3) = 1 (FIB(3)) + N(2) + N(1) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5
N(4) = 1 (FIB(4)) + N(3) + N(2) = 1 + 5 + 3 = 9

The number of recursive calls is the total number of calls minus 1 (the initial call).
R(n) = N(n) - 1
R(0) = 1 - 1 = 0
R(1) = 1 - 1 = 0
R(2) = 3 - 1 = 2
R(3) = 5 - 1 = 4
R(4) = 9 - 1 = 8

This matches the manual trace for FIB(4).
So, the number of recursive calls R(n) follows the relation:
R(n) = R(n-1) + R(n-2) + 1 for n > 1
R(0) = 0
R(1) = 0

Let's compute for FIB(10):
R(0) = 0
R(1) = 0
R(2) = R(1) + R(0) + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
R(3) = R(2) + R(1) + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2
R(4) = R(3) + R(2) + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
R(5) = R(4) + R(3) + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
R(6) = R(5) + R(4) + 1 = 7 + 4 + 1 = 12
R(7) = R(6) + R(5) + 1 = 12 + 7 + 1 = 20
R(8) = R(7) + R(6) + 1 = 20 + 12 + 1 = 33
R(9) = R(8) + R(7) + 1 = 33 + 20 + 1 = 54
R(10) = R(9) + R(8) + 1 = 54 + 33 + 1 = 88

Let's double check the logic.
When FIB(n) is evaluated, and n > 1, there are two recursive calls: FIB(n-1) and FIB(n-2).
The number of recursive calls is the sum of the recursive calls made by FIB(n-1) and FIB(n-2).

Consider the call tree for FIB(4):
      FIB(4)
     /      \
  FIB(3)    FIB(2)
  /   \     /   \
FIB(2) FIB(1) FIB(1) FIB(0)
/   \
FIB(1) FIB(0)

Recursive calls are all calls except the initial call.
Calls: FIB(3), FIB(2), FIB(1), FIB(0), FIB(1), FIB(2), FIB(1), FIB(0)
Number of recursive calls = 8.

Let the number of calls to FIB(n) be $C_n$.
$C_0 = 1$
$C_1 = 1$
$C_n = 1 + C_{n-1} + C_{n-2}$ for $n > 1$.

The number of recursive calls is the total number of calls minus 1.
Let $R_n$ be the number of recursive calls to compute FIB(n).
$R_n = C_n - 1$.

$R_0 = C_0 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$
$R_1 = C_1 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$
$R_n = (1 + C_{n-1} + C_{n-2}) - 1 = C_{n-1} + C_{n-2} = (R_{n-1} + 1) + (R_{n-2} + 1) = R_{n-1} + R_{n-2} + 2$.

This doesn't seem correct based on the trace.

Let's rethink from the definition of a recursive call.
When FIB(n) is evaluated, if n > 1, it makes two calls to FIB. These are the recursive calls made by this evaluation of FIB(n).

Let RC(n) be the number of recursive calls when evaluating FIB(n).
If n = 0 or n = 1, there are no recursive calls. RC(0) = 0, RC(1) = 0.
If n > 1, when evaluating FIB(n), we call FIB(n-1) and FIB(n-2).
The number of recursive calls is the sum of the recursive calls made in evaluating FIB(n-1) and FIB(n-2), plus the two calls made by the current invocation of FIB(n).

RC(n) = RC(n-1) + RC(n-2) + 2 for n > 1.
RC(0) = 0
RC(1) = 0
RC(2) = RC(1) + RC(0) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2
RC(3) = RC(2) + RC(1) + 2 = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4
RC(4) = RC(3) + RC(2) + 2 = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8
RC(5) = RC(4) + RC(3) + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14
RC(6) = RC(5) + RC(4) + 2 = 14 + 8 + 2 = 24
RC(7) = RC(6) + RC(5) + 2 = 24 + 14 + 2 = 40
RC(8) = RC(7) + RC(6) + 2 = 40 + 24 + 2 = 66
RC(9) = RC(8) + RC(7) + 2 = 66 + 40 + 2 = 108
RC(10) = RC(9) + RC(8) + 2 = 108 + 66 + 2 = 176

Let's consider the call tree again and count the edges that represent recursive calls.
      FIB(4)
     /      \
  FIB(3)    FIB(2)   (2 recursive calls from FIB(4))
  /   \     /   \
FIB(2) FIB(1) FIB(1) FIB(0) (2 from FIB(3), 2 from FIB(2))
/   \
FIB(1) FIB(0) (2 from FIB(2))

Total recursive calls = 2 (from level 4) + 2 (from FIB(3)) + 2 (from FIB(2) of left branch) + 2 (from FIB(2) of right branch) = 8.

Let's verify the formula RC(n) = RC(n-1) + RC(n-2) + 2.
RC(2) = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2. Calls are FIB(1), FIB(0).
RC(3). Calls from FIB(3): FIB(2), FIB(1).
Calls within FIB(2): FIB(1), FIB(0).
Calls within FIB(1): none.
Total recursive calls = 2 (from FIB(3)) + RC(2) + RC(1) = 2 + 2 + 0 = 4.

Consider the number of nodes in the call tree, excluding the root.
Number of calls N(n):
N(0) = 1
N(1) = 1
N(2) = N(1) + N(0) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
N(3) = N(2) + N(1) + 1 = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5
N(4) = N(3) + N(2) + 1 = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9

Number of recursive calls = Number of calls - 1.
RC(n) = N(n) - 1.
RC(0) = 1 - 1 = 0
RC(1) = 1 - 1 = 0
RC(2) = 3 - 1 = 2
RC(3) = 5 - 1 = 4
RC(4) = 9 - 1 = 8

This confirms the formula RC(n) = RC(n-1) + RC(n-2) + 2.

Now let's compute up to RC(10).
RC(0) = 0
RC(1) = 0
RC(2) = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2
RC(3) = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4
RC(4) = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8
RC(5) = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14
RC(6) = 14 + 8 + 2 = 24
RC(7) = 24 + 14 + 2 = 40
RC(8) = 40 + 24 + 2 = 66
RC(9) = 66 + 40 + 2 = 108
RC(10) = 108 + 66 + 2 = 176

Alternative approach:
Consider the number of times FIB(0) and FIB(1) are called in the computation of FIB(n).
Let $C_0(n)$ be the number of times FIB(0) is called when computing FIB(n).
Let $C_1(n)$ be the number of times FIB(1) is called when computing FIB(n).

FIB(2): FIB(1), FIB(0). $C_0(2) = 1, C_1(2) = 1$.
FIB(3): FIB(2) -> FIB(1), FIB(0); FIB(1). $C_0(3) = 1, C_1(3) = 2$.
FIB(4): FIB(3) -> FIB(2) -> FIB(1), FIB(0); FIB(1); FIB(2) -> FIB(1), FIB(0). $C_0(4) = 2, C_1(4) = 3$.
FIB(5): FIB(4) -> $C_0=2, C_1=3$; FIB(3) -> $C_0=1, C_1=2$. $C_0(5) = 2+1=3, C_1(5) = 3+2=5$.

$C_0(n) = C_0(n-1) + C_0(n-2)$ for $n > 1$, with $C_0(0) = 1, C_0(1) = 0$.
$C_1(n) = C_1(n-1) + C_1(n-2)$ for $n > 1$, with $C_1(0) = 0, C_1(1) = 1$.

$C_0(n) = F_{n-1}$
$C_1(n) = F_n$

Number of calls to FIB is the number of nodes in the call tree.
Number of calls = 1 + (number of calls to FIB(n-1)) + (number of calls to FIB(n-2)).
N(n) = 1 + N(n-1) + N(n-2).

Number of recursive calls = Total number of calls - 1.
Number of recursive calls = N(n) - 1.

Let $R_n$ be the number of recursive calls for FIB(n).
$R_n = N(n) - 1$.
$R_n = (1 + N(n-1) + N(n-2)) - 1 = N(n-1) + N(n-2) = (R_{n-1} + 1) + (R_{n-2} + 1) = R_{n-1} + R_{n-2} + 2$.

The base cases are when the function returns without making recursive calls.
For FIB(0) and FIB(1), the function returns. No recursive calls.
So, R(0) = 0, R(1) = 0.

The number of recursive calls when FIB(n) is evaluated is the number of times FIB is called, excluding the initial call.

Consider the number of additions performed.
FIB(n) makes one addition.
Total number of additions = Number of calls to FIB(n) - 1. This is not true.

The number of recursive calls is the number of times the FIB function is called within the evaluation of FIB(n), excluding the initial call.

When FIB(n) is called (n > 1), it calls FIB(n-1) and FIB(n-2). These are two recursive calls.

Final check:
FIB(2): Calls FIB(1), FIB(0). 2 recursive calls. RC(2) = 2.
FIB(3): Calls FIB(2), FIB(1).
       FIB(2) calls FIB(1), FIB(0).
       Recursive calls: FIB(2), FIB(1), FIB(1), FIB(0). Total 4. RC(3) = 4.
FIB(4): Calls FIB(3), FIB(2).
       FIB(3) calls FIB(2), FIB(1).
       FIB(2) calls FIB(1), FIB(0).
       FIB(2) calls FIB(1), FIB(0).
       Recursive calls: FIB(3), FIB(2), FIB(2), FIB(1), FIB(1), FIB(0), FIB(1), FIB(0). Total 8. RC(4) = 8.

The number of recursive calls is the sum of the recursive calls made in evaluating FIB(n-1) and FIB(n-2), plus the two calls made by the current invocation of FIB(n).</text>
<explanation>The solver creates a precise mathematical formulation of the problem, defining variables and recurrence relations that capture the structure of recursive calls in the Fibonacci function.</explanation>

<text>Let C(n) be the number of recursive calls when evaluating FIB(n).
C(0) = 0
C(1) = 0
C(2) = C(1) + C(0) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2
C(3) = C(2) + C(1) + 2 = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4
C(4) = C(3) + C(2) + 2 = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8
C(5) = C(4) + C(3) + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14</text>
<explanation>The solver proposes a new hypothesis (the recurrence relation with +2 instead of +1) and tests it by calculating values for small cases, showing a hypothesis testing approach.</explanation>

<text>Total recursive calls = 2 (from level 4) + 2 (from FIB(3)) + 2 (from FIB(2) of left branch) + 2 (from FIB(2) of right branch) = 8.

Let's verify the formula RC(n) = RC(n-1) + RC(n-2) + 2.</text>
<explanation>The solver tests their hypothesis (the recurrence relation) by manually counting recursive calls in their visual model and checking if it matches the formula's prediction.</explanation>

<text>RC(2) = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2. Calls are FIB(1), FIB(0).
RC(3). Calls from FIB(3): FIB(2), FIB(1).
Calls within FIB(2): FIB(1), FIB(0).
Calls within FIB(1): none.
Total recursive calls = 2 (from FIB(3)) + RC(2) + RC(1) = 2 + 2 + 0 = 4.</text>
<explanation>The solver continues to test their hypothesis by manually tracing the execution for specific cases (RC(2) and RC(3)), comparing the results with their formula's predictions.</explanation>

<text>Consider the number of nodes in the call tree, excluding the root.
Number of calls N(n):
N(0) = 1
N(1) = 1
N(2) = N(1) + N(0) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
N(3) = N(2) + N(1) + 1 = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5
N(4) = N(3) + N(2) + 1 = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes another pattern related to the number of nodes in the call tree, showing their ability to identify multiple patterns in the same problem context.</explanation>
