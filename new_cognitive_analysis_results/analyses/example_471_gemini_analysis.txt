Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let $f:D \to \mathbb{C}\setminus \{0\}$ be a holomorphic function such that $f(a)=1$ and $f(-a)=-1$ for $0<a<1$. We want to prove that $\sup_{z \in D} |f(z)| \geqslant \exp\left(\frac{1-a^2}{4a}\pi\right)$.
Since $f(z) \ne 0$ on $D$, there is a holomorphic function $g(z)$ on $D$ such that $f(z) = e^{g(z)}$.
Then $|f(z)| = |e^{g(z)}| = e^{\mathrm{Re}(g(z))}$.
The condition becomes $\sup_{z \in D} e^{\mathrm{Re}(g(z))} \geqslant \exp\left(\frac{1-a^2}{4a}\pi\right)$, which is equivalent to $\sup_{z \in D} \mathrm{Re}(g(z)) \geqslant \frac{1-a^2}{4a}\pi$.
From $f(a)=1$, we have $e^{g(a)}=1$, so $g(a) = 2\pi i k$ for some integer $k$.
From $f(-a)=-1$, we have $e^{g(-a)}=-1$, so $g(-a) = (2n+1)\pi i$ for some integer $n$.
