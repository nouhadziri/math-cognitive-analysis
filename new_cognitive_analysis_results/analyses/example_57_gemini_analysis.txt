Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let X be the real line R.
Let $\mathcal{B}_x$ be the collection of all Lebesgue-measurable sets containing x whose density at x equals 1.
We need to show that the collection of $\mathcal{B}_x$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ forms a neighborhood basis for a topology on $\mathbb{R}$.

To show that this defines a topology, we need to verify the neighborhood basis axioms:
1. For every $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $\mathcal{B}_x \neq \emptyset$.
   The set $\mathbb{R}$ is Lebesgue-measurable and its density at any point is 1. So $\mathbb{R} \in \mathcal{B}_x$.
2. For every $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$, $x \in B$.
   This is given in the definition of $\mathcal{B}_x$.
3. For every $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}_x$, there exists $B_3 \in \mathcal{B}_x$ such that $B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$.
   Let $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}_x$. Then $B_1$ and $B_2$ are Lebesgue-measurable sets containing x, and $D(B_1, x) = 1$ and $D(B_2, x) = 1$.
   $B_1 \cap B_2$ is Lebesgue-measurable and contains x.
   The density of $B_1 \cap B_2$ at x is $D(B_1 \cap B_2, x) = \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{m(B_1 \cap B_2 \cap (x-r, x+r))}{2r}$.
   We know that $m(B_1 \cap B_2 \cap (x-r, x+r)) = m(B_1 \cap (x-r, x+r)) + m(B_2 \cap (x-r, x+r)) - m((B_1 \cup B_2) \cap (x-r, x+r))$.
   Also $m((B_1 \cup B_2) \cap (x-r, x+r)) \le 2r$.
   $m(B_1 \cap (x-r, x+r))/2r \to 1$ and $m(B_2 \cap (x-r, x+r))/2r \to 1$.
   $m((B_1 \cup B_2) \cap (x-r, x+r))/2r \le 1$.
   $D(B_1 \cap B_2, x) = \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{m(B_1 \cap (x-r, x+r))}{2r} + \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{m(B_2 \cap (x-r, x+r))}{2r} - \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{m((B_1 \cup B_2) \cap (x-r, x+r))}{2r} \ge 1 + 1 - 1 = 1$.
   Since the density is always $\le 1$, $D(B_1 \cap B_2, x) = 1$.
   So $B_1 \cap B_2 \in \mathcal{B}_x$. We can choose $B_3 = B_1 \cap B_2$.
4. For every $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$, there exists $B' \in \mathcal{B}_x$ such that for every $y \in B'$, there exists $B'' \in \mathcal{B}_y$ such that $B'' \subseteq B$.
   Let $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$. This means $B$ is Lebesgue-measurable, $x \in B$, and $D(B, x) = 1$.
   Consider the interior of B in the standard topology, int(B). If int(B) is non-empty, we can choose a small open interval around x contained in B. This interval belongs to $\mathcal{B}_x$.
   Let's consider $B' = B$. For any $y \in B$, we need to find $B'' \in \mathcal{B}_y$ such that $B'' \subseteq B$.
   If $D(B, y) = 1$, we can choose $B'' = B$. But we don't know if $D(B, y) = 1$ for all $y \in B$.
   Let $A \in \mathcal{B}_x$. Then $D(A,x) = 1$. Consider the set of points y such that $D(A,y) = 1$. This set has full measure within A.
   Let $B' = \{y \in B : D(B, y) = 1\}$. This set contains x and is Lebesgue measurable. The density of $B'$ at x is 1.
   For any $y \in B'$, $D(B, y) = 1$, so $B \in \mathcal{B}_y$. We can choose $B'' = B$.

Now we need to show that this topology is regular.
A topological space is regular if for any point $x$ and any closed set $F$ not containing $x$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \in U$ and $F \subseteq V$.
Equivalently, for any point $x$ and any neighborhood $N$ of $x$, there exists a neighborhood $M$ of $x$ such that $\overline{M} \subseteq N$.
Let $N$ be a neighborhood of $x$. Then there exists a Lebesgue-measurable set $A$ containing $x$ with $D(A, x) = 1$ such that $A \subseteq N$.
Consider the complement of $N$, $N^c$, which is a closed set not containing $x$. We need to find disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \in U$ and $N^c \subseteq V$.
Let $A \in \mathcal{B}_x$. Consider the set of points with density 1 in A.
Let $F$ be a closed set and $x \notin F$. We want to find $U \in \mathcal{B}_x$ and an open set $V$ containing $F$ such that $U \cap V = \emptyset$.
Let $F$ be a closed set (in the new topology) and $x \notin F$. This means there exists a basis element $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$ such that $B \cap F = \emptyset$.
So there exists a Lebesgue-measurable set $B$ containing $x$ with $D(B, x) = 1$ such that $B \cap F = \emptyset$.
We need to find disjoint open sets in the topology.
Let $y \in F$. Since $B \cap F = \emptyset$, $y \notin B$. Since $F$ is closed, there exists a basis element $C_y \in \mathcal{B}_y$ such that $C_y \cap B = \emptyset$.
The union of $C_y$ for all $y \in F$ is an open set containing $F$.

Consider regularity. Let $x \in O$ where $O$ is open. Then there is $A \in \mathcal{B}_x$ such that $A \subseteq O$.
We need to find a neighborhood $W$ of $x$ such that $\overline{W} \subseteq O$.
Let $W = A$. We need to show that the closure of $A$ is contained in $O$.
The closure of $A$ is the set of all points $y$ such that every neighborhood of $y$ intersects $A$.
Let $y \notin O$. Since $O$ is open, there exists $B \in \mathcal{B}_y$ such that $B \subseteq O^c$.
Since $A \subseteq O$, $A \cap B = \emptyset$. So $y$ is not in the closure of $A$.
Thus, $\overline{A} \subseteq O$.
So the topology is regular.

Now we need to show that this topology is not normal.
A topological space is normal if for any two disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $A \subseteq U$ and $B \subseteq V$.
Consider two disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$.
Since $A$ is closed, for any $x \notin A$, there exists a basis element $U_x \in \mathcal{B}_x$ such that $U_x \cap A = \emptyset$.
Similarly, for any $y \notin B$, there exists a basis element $V_y \in \mathcal{B}_y$ such that $V_y \cap B = \emptyset$.
Consider the set of Lebesgue measure zero. Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be two disjoint Lebesgue measure zero sets (which can be uncountable).
The complement of a set with density 1 at a point has density 0 at that point.
Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint closed sets.
Suppose $U$ and $V$ are disjoint open sets such that $A \subseteq U$ and $B \subseteq V$.
For each $a \in A$, there exists a basis element $U_a \in \mathcal{B}_a$ such that $U_a \subseteq U$.
For each $b \in B$, there exists a basis element $V_b \in \mathcal{B}_b$ such that $V_b \subseteq V$.
Consider two disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$.
This means for every $x \notin A$, there exists a Lebesgue measurable set $W_x$ with density 1 at $x$ such that $W_x \cap A = \emptyset$.
For every $y \notin B$, there exists a Lebesgue measurable set $Z_y$ with density 1 at $y$ such that $Z_y \cap B = \emptyset$.

Consider the case of the real line with the standard topology. Let $A$ and $B$ be disjoint closed sets. We can find disjoint open sets.

Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint closed sets in this topology.
For each $a \in A$, since $a \notin B$ and $B$ is closed, there exists a Lebesgue measurable set $U_a$ containing $a$ with density 1 at $a$ such that $U_a \cap B = \emptyset$.
Similarly, for each $b \in B$, there exists a Lebesgue measurable set $V_b$ containing $b$ with density 1 at $b$ such that $V_b \cap A = \emptyset$.
Let $U = \bigcup_{a \in A} U_a$ and $V = \bigcup_{b \in B} V_b$. $U$ and $V$ are open sets, $A \subseteq U$ and $B \subseteq V$.
We need to show that it is possible to have $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$.

Consider two disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$.
Since they are closed, their complements are open.
$\mathbb{R} \setminus A = \bigcup_{x \notin A} B_x$, where $B_x \in \mathcal{B}_x$.
$\mathbb{R} \setminus B = \bigcup_{y \notin B} C_y$, where $C_y \in \mathcal{B}_y$.

Let $Z$ be a Lebesgue measure zero set. Consider two disjoint Lebesgue measure zero sets $A$ and $B$.
Consider the complements $A^c$ and $B^c$.
If the topology is normal, there exist disjoint open sets $U \supseteq A$ and $V \supseteq B$.
For each $a \in A$, there exists a Lebesgue measurable set $W_a$ containing $a$ with density 1 at $a$ such that $W_a \subseteq U$.
For each $b \in B$, there exists a Lebesgue measurable set $Z_b$ containing $b$ with density 1 at $b$ such that $Z_b \subseteq V$.
Since $U \cap V = \emptyset$, $W_a \cap Z_b = \emptyset$ for all $a \in A, b \in B$.

Consider the case where $A = \{0\}$ and $B = \{1\}$. These are closed sets.
We can take $U = (- \epsilon, \epsilon)$ and $V = (1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)$.

Consider two disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$.
For every $a \in A$, since $B$ is closed and $a \notin B$, there exists a neighborhood $N_a$ of $a$ such that $N_a \cap B = \emptyset$. This means there exists a Lebesgue measurable set $W_a$ containing $a$ with density 1 at $a$ such that $W_a \cap B = \emptyset$.
Similarly, for every $b \in B$, there exists a Lebesgue measurable set $Z_b$ containing $b$ with density 1 at $b$ such that $Z_b \cap A = \emptyset$.

Let $A$ be a closed set. For any $x \notin A$, there exists a basis element $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$ such that $B \cap A = \emptyset$.
Consider two disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$.
Assume the topology is normal. Then there exist disjoint open sets $U \supseteq A$ and $V \supseteq B$.
For each $a \in A$, there exists $U_a \in \mathcal{B}_a$ such that $U_a \subseteq U$.
For each $b \in B$, there exists $V_b \in \mathcal{B}_b$ such that $V_b \subseteq V$.
$U_a \cap V_b = \emptyset$ for all $a \in A, b \in B$.

Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint closed sets.
Consider the characteristic functions $\chi_A$ and $\chi_B$. These are lower semi-continuous functions.

Consider the example given by A. Csaszar.
Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint sets such that any Lebesgue measurable set with density 1 at a point of $A$ intersects any Lebesgue measurable set with density 1 at a point of $B$.
Consider $A = \{0\}$ and $B = \{1\}$.
Let $U$ be an open set containing 0. There exists a Lebesgue measurable set $M$ containing 0 with density 1 at 0 such that $M \subseteq U$.
Let $V$ be an open set containing 1. There exists a Lebesgue measurable set $N$ containing 1 with density 1 at 1 such that $N \subseteq V$.
If the topology is normal, we can find disjoint $U$ and $V$.
So we need to find two disjoint closed sets such that for any open $U \supseteq A$ and open $V \supseteq B$, $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$.

Consider two disjoint sets $A$ and $B$ such that for any neighborhoods $U$ of $A$ and $V$ of $B$, $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$.
Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint dense in themselves sets.
Consider the standard topology.

Let $A$ be a closed set. Then for every $x \notin A$, there exists a Lebesgue measurable set $B$ with density 1 at $x$ such that $B \cap A = \emptyset$.
Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint closed sets.
Assume there exist disjoint open sets $U \supseteq A$ and $V \supseteq B$.
For every $a \in A$, there exists a Lebesgue measurable set $U_a$ with density 1 at $a$ such that $U_a \subseteq U$.
For every $b \in B$, there exists a Lebesgue measurable set $V_b$ with density 1 at $b$ such that $V_b \subseteq V$.
Since $U \cap V = \emptyset$, we have $U_a \cap V_b = \emptyset$ for all $a \in A, b \in B$.

Consider the Cantor set $C$. It has measure zero.
Let $x \in C$. Any Lebesgue measurable set containing $x$ with density 1 at $x$ must intersect the complement of $C$, which has full measure.
Consider two disjoint perfect sets $A$ and $B$.
Consider non-measurable sets.

Let $A$ be a closed set. For any $x \notin A$, there exists a measurable set $M$ with density 1 at $x$ such that $M \cap A = \emptyset$.
Consider two disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$.
If the space is normal, there exist disjoint open sets $U \supseteq A$ and $V \supseteq B$.
For each $a \in A$, there exists a measurable set $U_a$ with density 1 at $a$, $U_a \subseteq U$.
For each $b \in B$, there exists a measurable set $V_b$ with density 1 at $b$, $V_b \subseteq V$.
$U_a \cap V_b = \emptyset$.

Consider two disjoint sets of full measure $E_1$ and $E_2$. This is not possible.
Consider two disjoint sets with non-zero measure.

Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint closed sets.
Assume the space is normal. There exist disjoint open sets $U \supseteq A$ and $V \supseteq B$.
For each $a \in A$, there is a measurable set $M_a$ with density 1 at $a$, $M_a \subseteq U$.
For each $b \in B$, there is a measurable set $N_b$ with density 1 at $b$, $N_b \subseteq V$.
$M_a \cap N_b = \emptyset$.

Consider the case of the density topology. This is regular but not completely regular.
The neighborhoods are sets with density 1 at the point.
Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint closed sets.
If the topology is normal, there exist disjoint open sets $U \supseteq A$ and $V \supseteq B$.
$U = \bigcup_{a \in A} M_a$, $V = \bigcup_{b \in B} N_b$, where $M_a$ has density 1 at $a$, $N_b$ has density 1 at $b$.

Consider two disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$.
For every $a \in A$, since $B$ is closed, there exists a neighborhood $W_a$ of $a$ such that $W_a \cap B = \emptyset$. This means there exists a measurable set $M_a$ with density 1 at $a$ such that $M_a \cap B = \emptyset$.
Similarly, for every $b \in B$, there exists a measurable set $N_b$ with density 1 at $b$ such that $N_b \cap A = \emptyset$.
Let $U = \bigcup_{a \in A} M_a$ and $V = \bigcup_{b \in B} N_b$. $U$ and $V$ are open, $A \subseteq U$, $B \subseteq V$.
We need to show that it's possible that $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$.

Consider two disjoint sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ such that every measurable set with density 1 at a point of $S_1$ intersects every measurable set with density 1 at a point of $S_2$.
Let $S_1 = \{0\}$ and $S_2 = \{1\}$.
Let $M$ be a measurable set with density 1 at 0, and $N$ be a measurable set with density 1 at 1.
We need to see if it is possible that $M \cap N = \emptyset$.
Consider $M = (-\epsilon, \epsilon)$ and $N = (1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)$ for small $\epsilon$. These have density 1 at 0 and 1 respectively. We can choose $\epsilon < 1/2$ so they are disjoint.

Consider two disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$ such that for any open $U \supseteq A$ and $V \supseteq B$, $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$.

   Let $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}_x$. Then $B_1$ and $B_2$ are Lebesgue-measurable sets containing x, and $D(B_1, x) = 1$ and $D(B_2, x) = 1$.
   $B_1 \cap B_2$ is Lebesgue-measurable and contains x.
   The density of $B_1 \cap B_2$ at x is $D(B_1 \cap B_2, x) = \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{m(B_1 \cap B_2 \cap (x-r, x+r))}{2r}$.
   We know that $m(B_1 \cap B_2 \cap (x-r, x+r)) = m(B_1 \cap (x-r, x+r)) + m(B_2 \cap (x-r, x+r)) - m((B_1 \cup B_2) \cap (x-r, x+r))$.
   Also $m((B_1 \cup B_2) \cap (x-r, x+r)) \le 2r$.
   $m(B_1 \cap (x-r, x+r))/2r \to 1$ and $m(B_2 \cap (x-r, x+r))/2r \to 1$.
   $m((B_1 \cup B_2) \cap (x-r, x+r))/2r \le 1$.
   $D(B_1 \cap B_2, x) = \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{m(B_1 \cap (x-r, x+r))}{2r} + \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{m(B_2 \cap (x-r, x+r))}{2r} - \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{m((B_1 \cup B_2) \cap (x-r, x+r))}{2r} \ge 1 + 1 - 1 = 1$.
   Since the density is always $\le 1$, $D(B_1 \cap B_2, x) = 1$.

   $B_1 \cap B_2$ is Lebesgue-measurable and contains x.
   The density of $B_1 \cap B_2$ at x is $D(B_1 \cap B_2, x) = \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{m(B_1 \cap B_2 \cap (x-r, x+r))}{2r}$.

<text>Consider two disjoint sets of full measure $E_1$ and $E_2$. This is not possible.
Consider two disjoint sets with non-zero measure.

Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint closed sets.
Assume the space is normal. There exist disjoint open sets $U \supseteq A$ and $V \supseteq B$.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies measure theory knowledge by recognizing that two disjoint sets of full measure cannot exist, which is a fundamental property of measure spaces. This demonstrates understanding of measure-theoretic principles in relation to the topology being studied.</explanation>

<text>For each $a \in A$, there is a measurable set $M_a$ with density 1 at $a$, $M_a \subseteq U$.
For each $b \in B$, there is a measurable set $N_b$ with density 1 at $b$, $N_b \subseteq V$.
$M_a \cap N_b = \emptyset$.

Consider the case of the density topology. This is regular but not completely regular.
The neighborhoods are sets with density 1 at the point.
Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint closed sets.</text>
<explanation>The solver begins constructing a counterexample to normality by considering the density topology and exploring its properties, working toward finding specific closed sets that cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.</explanation>

<text>Consider two disjoint sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ such that every measurable set with density 1 at a point of $S_1$ intersects every measurable set with density 1 at a point of $S_2$.
Let $S_1 = \{0\}$ and $S_2 = \{1\}$.
Let $M$ be a measurable set with density 1 at 0, and $N$ be a measurable set with density 1 at 1.
We need to see if it is possible that $M \cap N = \emptyset$.
Consider $M = (-\epsilon, \epsilon)$ and $N = (1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)$ for small $\epsilon$. These have density 1 at 0 and 1 respectively. We can choose $\epsilon < 1/2$ so they are disjoint.</text>
<explanation>The solver attempts to construct a specific counterexample to normality by considering the sets S₁ = {0} and S₂ = {1}, and exploring whether measurable sets with density 1 at these points can be disjoint. This is a direct attempt to find a concrete case where normality fails.</explanation>
