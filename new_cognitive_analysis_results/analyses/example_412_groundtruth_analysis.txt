Problem:
Let G, H be two finite groups, and let  $\varphi, \psi: G \to H$  be two surjective but non-injective homomorphisms. Prove that there exists an element of G that is not the identity element of G but whose images under  $\varphi$  and  $\psi$  are the same.

Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Define the problem and initial assumptions:**
   Let \( G \) and \( H \) be two finite groups, and let \( \varphi, \psi: G \to H \) be two surjective but non-injective homomorphisms. We need to prove that there exists an element of \( G \) that is not the identity element of \( G \) but whose images under \( \varphi \) and \( \psi \) are the same.

2. **Identity and kernel sizes:**
   Let \( e \) be the identity element in \( G \). Since \( \varphi \) and \( \psi \) are surjective but non-injective, their kernels are non-trivial. Let \( k = |\ker \varphi| \) and \( m = |H| \). Since \( \varphi \) is not injective, \( k > 1 \). By the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have:
   \[
   |G| = |\ker \varphi| \cdot |H| = k \cdot m
   \]
   Similarly, for \( \psi \), we have:
   \[
   |G| = |\ker \psi| \cdot |H| = k' \cdot m
   \]
   Since \( |G| \) and \( |H| \) are the same for both homomorphisms, it follows that \( |\ker \varphi| = |\ker \psi| = k \).

3. **Intersection of kernels:**
   If \( \ker \varphi \cap \ker \psi \) is non-trivial, then there exists an element in \( G \) (other than the identity) that is mapped to the identity in both \( \varphi \) and \( \psi \), and we are done. Assume \( \ker \varphi \cap \ker \psi = \{ e \} \). This implies that the product of the kernels has size:
   \[
   |\ker \varphi \ker \psi| = k^2
   \]

4. **Cosets and their properties:**
   Let \( G_i \) and \( S_i \) be the sets of left cosets \( G / \ker \varphi \) and \( G / \ker \psi \), respectively. For \( 1 \leq i \leq m \), let \( G_1 = \ker \varphi \) and \( S_1 = \ker \psi \). Define:
   \[
   G_i S_i^{-1} := \{ g_i s_i^{-1} \mid g_i \in G_i, s_i \in S_i \}
   \]

5. **Non-empty intersection of cosets:**
   We claim that it suffices to show that \( G_i S_i^{-1} \cap G_1 S_1^{-1} \) is non-empty for some \( i \), \( 2 \leq i \leq m \). Assume \( g_i s_i^{-1} = ab \) with \( ab \in G_1 S_1^{-1} \). Then:
   \[
   a^{-1} g_i = b s_i \implies \varphi(a^{-1} g_i) = \varphi(g_i) = \psi(s_i) = \psi(b s_i)
   \]

6. **Contradiction assumption:**
   Assume for the sake of contradiction that \( G_i S_i^{-1} \cap G_1 S_1^{-1} \) is empty for \( 2 \leq i \leq m \).

7. **Size and disjointness of cosets:**
   We claim that \( |G_i S_i^{-1}| = k^2 \) and \( G_i S_i^{-1} \cap G_j S_j^{-1} \) is empty for \( i \neq j \). If \( g_i s_i^{-1} = g_i a b^{-1} s_i^{-1} \) where \( a \in G_1 \) and \( b \in S_1 \), then \( a = b \), which is possible if and only if \( a = b = e \). This shows that:
   \[
   |G_i S_i^{-1}| = |G_i| \cdot |S_i| = k^2
   \]
   If \( g_i s_i^{-1} = g_j s_j^{-1} \), then \( g_j^{-1} g_i (s_j^{-1} s_i)^{-1} = e \). This is a contradiction since if \( g_j^{-1} g_i \in G_{\ell} \), then \( s_j^{-1} s_i \in S_{\ell} \) for some \( \ell \geq 2 \).

8. **Summing up the sizes:**
   We have shown that the sets \( G_i S_i^{-1} \) are pairwise disjoint, and \( |G_i S_i^{-1}| = k^2 \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \). Therefore:
   \[
   |G| = |\ker \varphi| \cdot |H| = m k \geq \sum_{i=1}^{m} |G_i S_i^{-1}| = m k^2
   \]
   Hence:
   \[
   k \leq 1
   \]
   This is a contradiction since \( k > 1 \).

Therefore, there must exist an element in \( G \) that is not the identity element of \( G \) but whose images under \( \varphi \) and \( \psi \) are the same.

<explanation>The solver begins by clearly restating the problem, identifying the mathematical objects (finite groups G and H), the mappings (surjective non-injective homomorphisms), and the goal (finding a non-identity element with same images).

   |G| = |\ker \varphi| \cdot |H| = k \cdot m
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the First Isomorphism Theorem from group theory to establish a relationship between the size of the group G, the kernel of the homomorphism, and the size of group H.

   \]
   Since \( |G| \) and \( |H| \) are the same for both homomorphisms, it follows that \( |\ker \varphi| = |\ker \psi| = k \).</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the same theorem to the second homomorphism and then uses logical deduction to conclude that the kernels must have the same size. This demonstrates the ability to chain logical steps to reach a valid conclusion.</explanation>

<text>**Intersection of kernels:**
   If \( \ker \varphi \cap \ker \psi \) is non-trivial, then there exists an element in \( G \) (other than the identity) that is mapped to the identity in both \( \varphi \) and \( \psi \), and we are done. Assume \( \ker \varphi \cap \ker \psi = \{ e \} \). This implies that the product of the kernels has size:
   \[
   |\ker \varphi \ker \psi| = k^2
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies a case that would immediately solve the problem, then assumes the opposite to set up a proof by contradiction. This demonstrates the strategic approach of assuming what you want to disprove and working toward a contradiction.</explanation>

<skill>Case Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to break down a problem into distinct cases or scenarios and analyze each one separately to build a comprehensive solution.</definition>

   If \( \ker \varphi \cap \ker \psi \) is non-trivial, then there exists an element in \( G \) (other than the identity) that is mapped to the identity in both \( \varphi \) and \( \psi \), and we are done. Assume \( \ker \varphi \cap \ker \psi = \{ e \} \).</text>
<explanation>The solver breaks down the problem into two cases: (1) when the intersection of kernels is non-trivial, which immediately solves the problem, and (2) when the intersection contains only the identity element, which requires further analysis. This demonstrates the ability to identify and separate distinct scenarios.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Modeling</skill>
<definition>The ability to create abstract mathematical structures to represent relationships in a problem and use these structures to derive new insights.</definition>

   \[
   G_i S_i^{-1} := \{ g_i s_i^{-1} \mid g_i \in G_i, s_i \in S_i \}
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver constructs a mathematical model using cosets to represent the problem in a different way. This demonstrates the ability to create abstract structures that capture the essential relationships in the problem and provide a framework for further analysis.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Insight</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify key observations or relationships that simplify the problem or provide a path to the solution.</definition>

<start>1424</start>
<end>1731</end>
<text>**Non-empty intersection of cosets:**
   We claim that it suffices to show that \( G_i S_i^{-1} \cap G_1 S_1^{-1} \) is non-empty for some \( i \), \( 2 \leq i \leq m \). Assume \( g_i s_i^{-1} = ab \) with \( ab \in G_1 S_1^{-1} \). Then:
   \[
   a^{-1} g_i = b s_i \implies \varphi(a^{-1} g_i) = \varphi(g_i) = \psi(s_i) = \psi(b s_i)
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver makes a crucial insight that reduces the problem to showing a certain intersection is non-empty. This demonstrates the ability to identify a key relationship that provides a path to the solution, simplifying the overall approach.</explanation>

<skill>Contradiction Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to work with an assumption that contradicts the desired conclusion and systematically derive logical consequences until reaching an actual contradiction.</definition>

<start>1732</start>
<end>2706</end>
<text>**Contradiction assumption:**
   Assume for the sake of contradiction that \( G_i S_i^{-1} \cap G_1 S_1^{-1} \) is empty for \( 2 \leq i \leq m \).

7. **Size and disjointness of cosets:**
   We claim that \( |G_i S_i^{-1}| = k^2 \) and \( G_i S_i^{-1} \cap G_j S_j^{-1} \) is empty for \( i \neq j \). If \( g_i s_i^{-1} = g_i a b^{-1} s_i^{-1} \) where \( a \in G_1 \) and \( b \in S_1 \), then \( a = b \), which is possible if and only if \( a = b = e \). This shows that:
   \[
   |G_i S_i^{-1}| = |G_i| \cdot |S_i| = k^2
   \]
   If \( g_i s_i^{-1} = g_j s_j^{-1} \), then \( g_j^{-1} g_i (s_j^{-1} s_i)^{-1} = e \). This is a contradiction since if \( g_j^{-1} g_i \in G_{\ell} \), then \( s_j^{-1} s_i \in S_{\ell} \) for some \( \ell \geq 2 \).</text>
<explanation>The solver works systematically with the contradiction assumption, deriving properties about the sizes and disjointness of the cosets. This demonstrates the ability to explore the logical consequences of an assumption until finding a contradiction.</explanation>

<skill>Quantitative Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to work with numerical relationships and inequalities to draw conclusions about mathematical quantities.</definition>

<start>2707</start>
<end>2970</end>
<text>**Summing up the sizes:**
   We have shown that the sets \( G_i S_i^{-1} \) are pairwise disjoint, and \( |G_i S_i^{-1}| = k^2 \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \). Therefore:
   \[
   |G| = |\ker \varphi| \cdot |H| = m k \geq \sum_{i=1}^{m} |G_i S_i^{-1}| = m k^2
   \]
   Hence:
   \[
   k \leq 1
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver uses quantitative reasoning to establish size relationships and derive an inequality. This demonstrates the ability to work with numerical constraints and draw conclusions based on these relationships.</explanation>

<skill>Proof Completion</skill>
<definition>The ability to recognize when a contradiction has been reached or when sufficient evidence has been provided to conclude the proof.</definition>

<start>2971</start>
<end>3227</end>
<text>This is a contradiction since \( k > 1 \).

Therefore, there must exist an element in \( G \) that is not the identity element of \( G \) but whose images under \( \varphi \) and \( \psi \) are the same.

\(\blacksquare\)</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies that a contradiction has been reached (k ≤ 1 contradicts k > 1) and correctly concludes that the original statement must be true. This demonstrates the ability to recognize when a proof has been completed and to articulate the final conclusion.</explanation>
