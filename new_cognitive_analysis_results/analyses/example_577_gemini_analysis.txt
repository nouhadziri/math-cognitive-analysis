Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group with no elements of order 4, and let $f:G \rightarrow G$ be a group morphism such that $f(x) \in \{x, x^{-1}\}$ for all $x \in G$. We want to prove that either $f(x) = x$ for all $x \in G$, or $f(x) = x^{-1}$ for all $x \in G$.

Let $A = \{x \in G \mid f(x) = x\}$ and $B = \{x \in G \mid f(x) = x^{-1}\}$.
Since for all $x \in G$, $f(x) \in \{x, x^{-1}\}$, we have $A \cup B = G$.
Since $f$ is a group morphism, for any $x, y \in G$, we have $f(xy) = f(x)f(y)$.

Consider $x \in A$ and $y \in A$. Then $f(x) = x$ and $f(y) = y$.
$f(xy) = f(x)f(y) = xy$. So $xy \in A$.
This means that $A$ is a subgroup of $G$.

Consider $x \in B$ and $y \in B$. Then $f(x) = x^{-1}$ and $f(y) = y^{-1}$.
$f(xy) = f(x)f(y) = x^{-1}y^{-1}$.
If $xy \in A$, then $f(xy) = xy$, so $xy = x^{-1}y^{-1}$.
Multiply by $x$ on the left and $y$ on the right: $xyxy = yy^{-1}xx^{-1} = e$.
If $xy \in B$, then $f(xy) = (xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}$.
So $x^{-1}y^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}$.
Multiply by $y$ on the left and $x$ on the right: $yy^{-1}x^{-1}x = yx^{-1}xx$, so $e = yx$.
This implies $xy = e$.

Consider $x \in A$ and $y \in B$. Then $f(x) = x$ and $f(y) = y^{-1}$.
$f(xy) = f(x)f(y) = xy^{-1}$.
If $xy \in A$, then $f(xy) = xy$, so $xy = xy^{-1}$. Multiply by $y$ on the right, $xy^2 = xy y^{-1} y = x e y = xy$.
Multiply by $x^{-1}$ on the left, $y^2 = e$.
If $xy \in B$, then $f(xy) = (xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}$.
So $xy^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}$.
Multiply by $y$ on the left: $yxy^{-1} = yy^{-1}x^{-1} = x^{-1}$.
Multiply by $y$ on the right: $yxy^{-1}y = x^{-1}y$, so $yx = x^{-1}y$.

Assume there exists $a, b \in G$ such that $f(a) = a$ and $f(b) = b^{-1}$ with $a \neq e$ and $b \neq e$.
If for all $x \in G$, $x^2 = e$, then $x^{-1} = x$, so $f(x) = x$ and $f(x) = x^{-1}$ are the same.

If there exists $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, consider $ab$.
Case 1: $ab \in A$. Then $f(ab) = ab$. Also $f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = ab^{-1}$. So $ab = ab^{-1}$. Multiply by $b^{-1}$ on the right, $abb^{-1} = ab^{-1}b^{-1}$, so $a = ab^{-2}$. Multiply by $a^{-1}$ on the left, $e = b^{-2}$, so $b^2 = e$.
Case 2: $ab \in B$. Then $f(ab) = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$. Also $f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = ab^{-1}$. So $ab^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$.

Consider $x \in G$. If $f(x) = x$, then $f(x^2) = f(x)f(x) = x \cdot x = x^2$.
If $f(x) = x^{-1}$, then $f(x^2) = f(x)f(x) = x^{-1}x^{-1} = (x^2)^{-1}$.
So for all $x \in G$, $f(x^2) = x^2$ or $f(x^2) = (x^2)^{-1}$.

Let $x \in A$ and $y \in B$.
If $xy \in A$, then $f(xy) = xy$. Also $f(xy) = f(x)f(y) = xy^{-1}$. So $xy = xy^{-1}$, which implies $y^2 = e$.
If $xy \in B$, then $f(xy) = (xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}$. Also $f(xy) = f(x)f(y) = xy^{-1}$. So $y^{-1}x^{-1} = xy^{-1}$. Multiply by $y$ on the right: $y^{-1}x^{-1}y = x$. Multiply by $y$ on the left: $x^{-1}y = yx$.

Assume there exist $a, b \in G$ such that $f(a)=a$ and $f(b)=b^{-1}$.
We know $a^2 \in A$.
We know $b^2 \in A$.
Consider $ab$. If $ab \in A$, then $f(ab) = ab$ and $f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = ab^{-1}$, so $ab = ab^{-1}$, hence $b^2 = e$.
If $ab \in B$, then $f(ab) = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$ and $f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = ab^{-1}$, so $b^{-1}a^{-1} = ab^{-1}$.

Assume there exist $a, b \in G$ such that $f(a) = a$ and $f(b) = b^{-1}$.
Since $A$ is a subgroup, if $b^2 = e$, then $b \in B$ means $f(b) = b^{-1} = b$.

Assume there exists $a \in A \setminus \{e\}$ and $b \in B \setminus \{e\}$.
We know $a^2 \in A$ and $b^2 \in A$.
Consider $ab$. If $ab \in A$, then $f(ab) = ab$ and $f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = ab^{-1}$, so $ab = ab^{-1}$, which means $b^2 = e$.
If $ab \in B$, then $f(ab) = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$ and $f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = ab^{-1}$, so $b^{-1}a^{-1} = ab^{-1}$.

Suppose there exist $a, b \in G$ such that $f(a) = a$ and $f(b) = b^{-1}$.
Then $f(aba) = f(a)f(b)f(a) = aba^{-1}$.
Since $f(aba) \in \{aba, (aba)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}\}$.
Case 1: $aba = aba^{-1}$. Then $e = a^{-1}$, so $a = e$, contradiction.
Case 2: $aba = a^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}$. Multiply by $a^{-1}$ on left and $a$ on right: $ba = a^{-2}b^{-1}$.

Suppose there exist $a, b \in G$ such that $f(a) = a$ and $f(b) = b^{-1}$.
Then $f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = ab^{-1}$.
If $ab \in A$, then $f(ab) = ab$, so $ab = ab^{-1}$, thus $b^2 = e$.
If $ab \in B$, then $f(ab) = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$, so $ab^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$.

Suppose there exists $x$ such that $f(x) = x$ and there exists $y$ such that $f(y) = y^{-1}$.
Consider $xy$.
If $f(xy) = xy$, then $f(x)f(y) = xy$, so $xy^{-1} = xy$, so $y^{-1} = y$, so $y^2 = e$.
If $f(xy) = (xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}$, then $f(x)f(y) = xy^{-1}$, so $xy^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}$.

Let $x \in G$. Consider $f(x^2) = f(x)^2$.
If $f(x) = x$, then $f(x^2) = x^2$.
If $f(x) = x^{-1}$, then $f(x^2) = (x^{-1})^2 = x^{-2}$.
Also, $f(x^2) \in \{x^2, (x^2)^{-1}\}$.
So if $f(x) = x$, then $f(x^2) = x^2$.
If $f(x) = x^{-1}$, then $f(x^2) = x^{-2}$. We also know $f(x^2) \in \{x^2, x^{-2}\}$.

Assume there exist $a, b \in G$ such that $f(a) = a$ and $f(b) = b^{-1}$.
We know $b^2 \in A$. So $f(b^2) = b^2$.
Also $f(b^2) = f(b)^2 = (b^{-1})^2 = b^{-2}$.
So $b^2 = b^{-2}$. Multiply by $b^2$, $b^4 = e$.
Since $G$ has no element of order 4, we must have $b^2 = e$ or $b = e$.
If $b^2 = e$, then $f(b) = b^{-1} = b$. So $b \in A$. This contradicts $f(b) = b^{-1}$ unless $b=e$.

If there exists $b$ such that $f(b) = b^{-1}$, then $b^2 \in A$.
So for all $y \in B$, $y^2 \in A$.
If $y \in B$, then $f(y) = y^{-1}$.
$f(y^2) = f(y)^2 = (y^{-1})^2 = y^{-2}$.
Since $y^2 \in A$, $f(y^2) = y^2$.
So $y^2 = y^{-2}$, which means $y^4 = e$.
Since $G$ has no element of order 4, $y^2 = e$.
So for all $y \in B$, $y^2 = e$. This means $y^{-1} = y$.
So for all $y \in B$, $f(y) = y^{-1} = y$.
This means $B \subseteq A$.
Since $A \cup B = G$, and $B \subseteq A$, we have $A = G$.
So $f(x) = x$ for all $x \in G$.

Assume there exists $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.
We showed that for all $y \in B$, $y^2 = e$.
If $ab \in B$, then $(ab)^2 = e$, so $abab = e$.
We also have $f(ab) = ab^{-1}$ and $f(ab) = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$.
So $ab^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$. Multiply by $b$ on the right: $a = b^{-1}a^{-1}b$.
Multiply by $b$ on the left: $ba = a^{-1}b$.

Assume there exists $a \in A \setminus \{e\}$ and $b \in B \setminus \{e\}$.
We know $b^2 = e$.
Consider $ab$. If $ab \in A$, then $f(ab) = ab$ and $f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = ab^{-1} = ab$, which gives no contradiction.
If $ab \in B$, then $f(ab) = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1} = ba^{-1}$.
Also $f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = ab^{-1} = ab$.
So $ba^{-1} = ab$. Multiply by $a$ on the right: $b = aba$.

Suppose there exists $a \in A \setminus \{e\}$ and $b \in B \setminus \{e\}$.
We know $b^2 = e$.
Consider $aba$. $f(aba) = f(a)f(b)f(a) = aba^{-1}$.
Also $aba \in A$ or $aba \in B$.
If $aba \in A$, then $f(aba) = aba$. So $aba = aba^{-1}$, which implies $a = e$, a contradiction.
If $aba \in B$, then $f(aba) = (aba)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1} = a^{-1}ba^{-1}$.
So $aba^{-1} = a^{-1}ba^{-1}$. Multiply by $a$ on the left and right: $aba = bab$.
Since $b^2 = e$, $f(b) = b^{-1} = b$. So $b \in A$. Contradiction.

If there exists $b \in B$, then for all $b \in B$, $b^2 = e$.
Then for all $b \in B$, $f(b) = b^{-1} = b$.
So $B \subseteq A$.
Since $A \cup B = G$, then $A = G$.
So $f(x) = x$ for all $x \in G$.

If $B$ is empty, then $A = G$, so $f(x) = x$ for all $x \in G$.
Assume $B$ is not empty. Let $b \in B$.
Then $f(b) = b^{-1}$.
Consider any $x \in G$.
If $f(x) = x$, then $f(xb) = f(x)f(b) = xb^{-1}$.
If $xb \in A$, then $f(xb) = xb$, so $xb^{-1} = xb$, so $b^{-1} = b$, so $b^2 = e$.
If $xb \in B$, then $f(xb) = (xb)^{-1} = b^{-1}x^{-1}$.
So $xb^{-1} = b^{-1}x^{-1}$.

If $f(x) = x^{-1}$, then $f(xb) = f(x)f(b) = x^{-1}b^{-1} = (bx)^{-1}$.
If $xb \in A$, then $f(xb) = xb$, so $x^{-1}b^{-1} = xb$.
If $xb \in B$, then $f(xb) = (xb)^{-1} = b^{-1}x^{-1}$.
So $x^{-1}b^{-1} = b^{-1}x^{-1}$.

Assume there exists an element $b$ such that $f(b) = b^{-1}$.
We have shown that $b^2 = e$.
So for all $y \in B$, $y^2 = e$.
This means for all $y \in B$, $f(y) = y^{-1} = y$.
So $B \subseteq A$.
Since $A \cup B = G$, this implies $A = G$.
So $f(x) = x$ for all $x \in G$.

The argument should be:
If $B$ is non-empty, then for any $b \in B$, $f(b) = b^{-1}$.
Consider $f(b^2) = f(b)f(b) = b^{-1}b^{-1} = b^{-2}$.
Also $f(b^2) \in \{b^2, (b^2)^{-1}\}$.
So $b^{-2} = b^2$ or $b^{-2} = b^{-2}$.
If $b^{-2} = b^2$, then $b^4 = e$. Since there are no elements of order 4, $b^2 = e$.
So for all $b \in B$, $b^2 = e$, which means $b^{-1} = b$.
Since for $b \in B$, $f(b) = b^{-1}$, then $f(b) = b$.
So $B \subseteq A$.
Since $A \cup B = G$, we have $A = G$.
So $f(x) = x$ for all $x \in G$.

Therefore, either $B$ is empty (so $A = G$, $f(x) = x$ for all $x \in G$) or $B$ is non-empty (which implies $A = G$, $f(x) = x$ for all $x \in G$).

Let's check if the deduction is correct.
If $B$ is non-empty, then for any $b \in B$, $f(b) = b^{-1}$.
Since $f$ is a homomorphism, $f(b^2) = f(b)f(b) = b^{-1}b^{-1} = b^{-2}$.
Since $f(x) \in \{x, x^{-1}\}$ for all $x \in G$, we have $f(b^2) \in \{b^2, (b^2)^{-1}\}$.
So $b^{-2} = b^2$ or $b^{-2} = (b^2)^{-1} = b^{-2}$.
If $b^{-2} = b^2$, then $b^4 = e$. Since $G$ has no elements of order 4, $b^2 = e$.
If $b^2 = e$, then $b^{-1} = b$.
Since $b \in B$, $f(b) = b^{-1}$. So $f(b) = b$.
This means $b \in A$.
So if $B$ is non-empty, then any element in $B$ is also in $A$.
So $B \subseteq A$.
Since $A \cup B = G$, and $B \subseteq A$, we have $A = G$.
So $f(x) = x$ for all $x \in G$.

This means that if there exists any element $b$ such that $f(b) = b^{-1}$, then in fact $f(x) = x$ for all $x \in G$.
So, either for all $x \in G$, $f(x) = x$, or for all $x \in G$, $f(x) = x^{-1}$.
If there exists $x$ such that $f(x) = x$, and there exists $y$ such that $f(y) = y^{-1}$.
Then the previous reasoning shows that $f(y) = y$, contradiction.

Since $f(x) \in \{x, x^{-1}\}$ for all $x \in G$, we have $f(b^2) \in \{b^2, (b^2)^{-1}\}$.
So $b^{-2} = b^2$ or $b^{-2} = (b^2)^{-1} = b^{-2}$.
If $b^{-2} = b^2$, then $b^4 = e$. Since $G$ has no elements of order 4, $b^2 = e$.

3. Set-Based Reasoning - The solver effectively uses set definitions and properties to structure the problem and derive key insights about the function's behavior.

4. Algebraic Manipulation - The solver skillfully transforms equations using group properties to derive crucial relationships between elements.

5. Contradiction Method - The solver employs proof by contradiction to establish that the function must behave uniformly across all elements of the group.
