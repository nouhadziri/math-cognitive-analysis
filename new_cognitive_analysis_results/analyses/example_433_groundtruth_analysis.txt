Problem:
Numbers $m$ and $n$ are on the number line. What is the value of $n-m$?

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
On a number line, the markings are evenly spaced. Since there are 6 spaces between 0 and 30, each space represents a change of $\frac{30}{6}=5$. Since $n$ is 2 spaces to the right of 60, then $n=60+2 \times 5=70$. Since $m$ is 3 spaces to the left of 30, then $m=30-3 \times 5=15$. Therefore, $n-m=70-15=55$.

# Analysis of Cognitive Skills in the Mathematical Problem-Solving Trajectory

<skill>Spatial Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to understand, reason about, and manipulate spatial relationships between objects or representations, including visualization of positions on a number line.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>47</end>
<text>On a number line, the markings are evenly spaced.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates spatial reasoning by recognizing the number line as a spatial representation with evenly distributed markings, which is essential for correctly interpreting the positions of numbers m and n.</explanation>

<start>203</start>
<end>246</end>
<text>Since $n$ is 2 spaces to the right of 60</text>
<explanation>The solver uses spatial reasoning to identify the relative position of n on the number line, specifically understanding directional relationships (right of) and counting spaces from a reference point (60).</explanation>

<start>282</start>
<end>324</end>
<text>Since $m$ is 3 spaces to the left of 30</text>
<explanation>Similar to the previous example, the solver uses spatial reasoning to locate m on the number line by understanding its position relative to the reference point 30, including the direction (left) and distance (3 spaces).</explanation>

<skill>Proportional Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to recognize and work with relationships between quantities, particularly understanding how ratios and proportions can be used to find unknown values.</definition>

<start>48</start>
<end>126</end>
<text>Since there are 6 spaces between 0 and 30, each space represents a change of $\frac{30}{6}=5$.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates proportional reasoning by establishing the relationship between the total distance (30 units) and the number of spaces (6), calculating the unit value per space (5 units). This shows understanding of how to determine a scale factor.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Translation</skill>
<definition>The ability to convert verbal or visual information into mathematical expressions and equations.</definition>

<start>247</start>
<end>281</end>
<text>then $n=60+2 \times 5=70$</text>
<explanation>The solver translates the spatial position of n into an algebraic expression by adding the product of spaces (2) and unit value (5) to the reference point (60), demonstrating the ability to convert visual/spatial information into a precise mathematical formula.</explanation>

<start>325</start>
<end>360</end>
<text>then $m=30-3 \times 5=15$</text>
<explanation>Similarly, the solver translates m's position into an algebraic expression, this time subtracting the product of spaces (3) and unit value (5) from the reference point (30), again showing algebraic translation of spatial information.</explanation>

<start>361</start>
<end>392</end>
<text>Therefore, $n-m=70-15=55$.</text>
<explanation>The solver translates the original question about n-m into a concrete calculation using the values determined for n and m, completing the algebraic translation process.</explanation>

<skill>Computational Fluency</skill>
<definition>The ability to perform calculations accurately and efficiently, including arithmetic operations like division, multiplication, addition, and subtraction.</definition>

<start>106</start>
<end>126</end>
<text>$\frac{30}{6}=5$</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates computational fluency by correctly dividing 30 by 6 to get 5.</explanation>

<start>266</start>
<end>281</end>
<text>2 \times 5=70</text>
<explanation>The solver shows computational fluency by multiplying 2 by 5 to get 10 and then adding to 60 to get 70 (though the intermediate step of 60+10=70 is implied rather than explicitly shown).</explanation>

<start>345</start>
<end>360</end>
<text>3 \times 5=15</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates computational fluency by multiplying 3 by 5 to get 15 and then subtracting from 30 to get 15 (though the intermediate step of 30-15=15 is implied rather than explicitly shown).</explanation>

<start>382</start>
<end>392</end>
<text>70-15=55</text>
<explanation>The solver shows computational fluency by correctly subtracting 15 from 70 to get 55.</explanation>

<skill>Sequential Processing</skill>
<definition>The ability to follow a logical sequence of steps to solve a problem, building on previous results to reach a final solution.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>392</end>
<text>On a number line, the markings are evenly spaced. Since there are 6 spaces between 0 and 30, each space represents a change of $\frac{30}{6}=5$. Since $n$ is 2 spaces to the right of 60, then $n=60+2 \times 5=70$. Since $m$ is 3 spaces to the left of 30, then $m=30-3 \times 5=15$. Therefore, $n-m=70-15=55$.</text>
<explanation>The entire solution demonstrates sequential processing as the solver follows a clear, logical progression: first establishing the scale of the number line, then finding the value of n, then finding the value of m, and finally calculating n-m. Each step builds upon previous results in a structured sequence.</explanation>
