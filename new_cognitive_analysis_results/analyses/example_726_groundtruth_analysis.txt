Problem:
Two parallel square plates of side length $1 \mathrm{~m}$ are placed a distance $30 \mathrm{~cm}$ apart whose centers are at $(-15 \mathrm{~cm}, 0,0)$ and $(15 \mathrm{~cm}, 0,0)$ have uniform charge densities $-10^{-6} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ and $10^{-6} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ respectively. Find the magnitude of the component of the electric field perpendicular to axis passing through the centers of the two plates at $(10 \mathrm{~cm}, 1 \mathrm{~mm}, 0)$.

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
By symmetry, the electric field due to the portion of the plates between $y=50 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $y=-49.8 \mathrm{~cm}$ will cancel out. We only need to consider the electric field from two $2 \mathrm{~mm}$ wide strips of charge, which are small enough to be approximated as wires with charge per unit length $\lambda=\sigma w= \pm 2 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ at a distance $y=50 \mathrm{~cm}$ away. The y-component of the electric field from these wires is then
$$
\begin{aligned}
& E_{y}=\frac{0.5 \lambda}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \int_{-0.5}^{0.5}\left(\frac{1}{\left(z^{2}+0.5^{2}+0.05^{2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}-\frac{1}{\left(z^{2}+0.5^{2}+0.25^{2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}\right) \mathrm{d} z \\
& E_{y}=\frac{0.5 \lambda}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{z}{\left(0.5^{2}+0.05^{2}\right) \sqrt{z^{2}+0.5^{2}+0.05^{2}}}-\frac{z}{\left(0.5^{2}+0.25^{2}\right) \sqrt{z^{2}+0.5^{2}+0.25^{2}}}\right) \\
& E_{y}=\frac{0.5 \lambda}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{1}{\left(0.5^{2}+0.05^{2}\right) \sqrt{0.5^{2}+0.5^{2}+0.05^{2}}}-\frac{1}{\left(0.5^{2}+0.25^{2}\right) \sqrt{0.5^{2}+0.5^{2}+0.25^{2}}}\right)=11.9 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}
