Problem:
Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that when $1^3+2^3+3^3+\cdots +n^3$ is divided by $n+5$ , the remainder is $17$ .

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the sum of all positive integers $n$ that satisfy a certain condition involving the sum of the first $n$ cubes and a division by $n+5$.

The sum of the first $n$ cubes is given by the formula:
$$1^3+2^3+3^3+\cdots +n^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}$$

The problem states that when this sum is divided by $n+5$, the remainder is $17$. We can write this as:
$$\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}$$

We need to work with this congruence. Let $m = n+5$, so $n = m-5$. Substituting this into the congruence:
$$\frac{(m-5)^2(m-5+1)^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{m}$$
$$\frac{(m-5)^2(m-4)^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{m}$$

We have $(m-5) \equiv -5 \pmod{m}$ and $(m-4) \equiv -4 \pmod{m}$.
So, $(m-5)^2 \equiv (-5)^2 = 25 \pmod{m}$ and $(m-4)^2 \equiv (-4)^2 = 16 \pmod{m}$.

Substituting these into the congruence:
$$\frac{25 \cdot 16}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{m}$$
$$\frac{400}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{m}$$
$$100 \equiv 17 \pmod{m}$$

This means $100 - 17$ is divisible by $m$, so $83$ is divisible by $m$.
$83 = km$ for some integer $k$. Since $m = n+5$ and $n$ is a positive integer, $m > 5$.

The divisors of $83$ are $1, 83, -1, -83$.
Since $m > 5$, the only possible value for $m$ is $83$.

If $m = 83$, then $n+5 = 83$, which gives $n = 78$.

We need to check if $n=78$ is a valid solution. We need to ensure that the division by $4$ is valid in the context of modular arithmetic. The original expression involves a fraction, which can be handled by multiplying by the modular inverse if it exists.

Let's go back to the original congruence:
$$\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}$$

Multiply both sides by $4$:
$$n^2(n+1)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5}$$

Substitute $n \equiv -5 \pmod{n+5}$ and $n+1 \equiv -4 \pmod{n+5}$:
$$(-5)^2(-4)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5}$$
$$25 \cdot 16 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5}$$
$$400 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5}$$
$$400 - 68 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5}$$
$$332 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5}$$

This means $n+5$ divides $332$.
We have $332 = 2^2 \cdot 83$. The divisors of $332$ are $1, 2, 4, 83, 166, 332$.

Since $n$ is a positive integer, $n+5 > 5$.
The possible values for $n+5$ are $83, 166, 332$.

Case 1: $n+5 = 83 \implies n = 78$.
Case 2: $n+5 = 166 \implies n = 161$.
Case 3: $n+5 = 332 \implies n = 327$.

Now we need to verify that for these values of $n$, the remainder is indeed $17$.

Let $S_n = 1^3+2^3+\cdots+n^3 = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}$.
We are given $S_n \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}$.

Consider $n=78$. Then $n+5 = 83$.
$S_{78} = \frac{78^2 \cdot 79^2}{4} = (39 \cdot 79)^2 = (3081)^2 = 9492561$.
We need to find the remainder when $9492561$ is divided by $83$.
$9492561 \div 83 = 114368.2048...$
$9492561 = 114368 \times 83 + R$
$9492561 = 9492544 + R$
$R = 9492561 - 9492544 = 17$.
So, for $n=78$, the remainder is $17$.

Consider $n=161$. Then $n+5 = 166$.
$S_{161} = \frac{161^2 \cdot 162^2}{4} = 161^2 \cdot 81^2 = (161 \cdot 81)^2 = (13041)^2 = 170067681$.
We need to find the remainder when $170067681$ is divided by $166$.
$170067681 \div 166 = 1024504.102...$
$170067681 = 1024504 \times 166 + R$
$170067681 = 170067664 + R$
$R = 170067681 - 170067664 = 17$.
So, for $n=161$, the remainder is $17$.

Consider $n=327$. Then $n+5 = 332$.
$S_{327} = \frac{327^2 \cdot 328^2}{4} = 327^2 \cdot 164^2 = (327 \cdot 164)^2 = (53628)^2 = 2876003984$.
We need to find the remainder when $2876003984$ is divided by $332$.
$2876003984 \div 332 = 8662662.602...$
$2876003984 = 8662662 \times 332 + R$
$2876003984 = 2875999784 + R$
$R = 2876003984 - 2875999784 = 4200$.
Something is wrong here. The remainder should be $17$.

Let's recheck the modular arithmetic.
We had $n^2(n+1)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5}$.
Let $m = n+5$. Then $n \equiv -5 \pmod{m}$, $n+1 \equiv -4 \pmod{m}$.
$(-5)^2(-4)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{m}$
$25 \cdot 16 \equiv 68 \pmod{m}$
$400 \equiv 68 \pmod{m}$
$400 - 68 = 332 \equiv 0 \pmod{m}$
So, $m$ divides $332$.

We need to ensure that the multiplication by $4$ is valid. The original congruence is:
$\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}$

This means $\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} - 17 = k(n+5)$ for some integer $k$.
$n^2(n+1)^2 - 68 = 4k(n+5)$
$n^2(n+1)^2 - 68 \equiv 0 \pmod{4(n+5)}$

Let's reconsider the problem statement carefully. The remainder when $1^3+...+n^3$ is divided by $n+5$ is $17$.
This means $1^3+...+n^3 = q(n+5) + 17$, where $q$ is the quotient.
$\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} = q(n+5) + 17$
$n^2(n+1)^2 = 4q(n+5) + 68$
$n^2(n+1)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5}$

This part seems correct. The conclusion that $n+5$ divides $332$ is also correct.

Let's check the calculation for $n=327$ again.
$n+5 = 332$.
We need $\frac{327^2 \cdot 328^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{332}$.
$\frac{106929 \cdot 107584}{4} = 106929 \cdot 26896 = 2876003984$.
Remainder when $2876003984$ is divided by $332$.
$2876003984 = 8662662 \times 332 + 4200$.
Remainder is $4200$, not $17$. So $n=327$ is not a solution.

The possible values for $n$ are $78$ and $161$.
The sum of these values is $78 + 161 = 239$.

Double-check the logic.
The condition is that when $S_n$ is divided by $n+5$, the remainder is $17$.
This means $S_n = k(n+5) + 17$ for some integer $k$.
$S_n - 17 = k(n+5)$.
So, $S_n - 17$ is divisible by $n+5$.
$S_n - 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5}$
$S_n \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}$

We used the formula for $S_n = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}$. This assumes the result is an integer.

Consider the case when $n$ is such that $n(n+1)$ is divisible by $2$. This is always true.
So, $n(n+1)/2$ is an integer.
The square of an integer is an integer, so $S_n$ is always an integer.

The congruence $\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}$ is valid.

Let's use polynomial long division.
We have $P(n) = n^2(n+1)^2 = n^2(n^2+2n+1) = n^4+2n^3+n^2$.
We are dividing by $n+5$.
Consider the polynomial $P(x) = x^4+2x^3+x^2$.
By the Remainder Theorem, when $P(n)$ is divided by $n-(-5)$, the remainder is $P(-5)$.
$P(-5) = (-5)^4 + 2(-5)^3 + (-5)^2 = 625 + 2(-125) + 25 = 625 - 250 + 25 = 375 + 25 = 400$.
So, $n^4+2n^3+n^2 \equiv 400 \pmod{n+5}$.

The congruence is $\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}$.
Multiply by $4$: $n^2(n+1)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5}$.
We have $n^2(n+1)^2 \equiv 400 \pmod{n+5}$.
So, $400 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5}$.
$400 - 68 = 332 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5}$.
This means $n+5$ divides $332$.

The positive divisors of $332$ are $1, 2, 4, 83, 166, 332$.
Since $n$ is a positive integer, $n+5 > 5$.
Possible values for $n+5$: $83, 166, 332$.
Possible values for $n$: $78, 161, 327$.

We need to check if the original congruence holds for these values of $n$.

Case $n=78$: $n+5 = 83$.
$S_{78} = 9492561$.
$9492561 \div 83 = 114368$ remainder $17$. (Checked)

Case $n=161$: $n+5 = 166$.
$S_{161} = 170067681$.
$170067681 \div 166 = 1024504$ remainder $17$. (Checked)

Case $n=327$: $n+5 = 332$.
$S_{327} = 2876003984$.
$2876003984 \div 332 = 8662662$ remainder $4200$. Not $17$.

So, the only positive integer values of $n$ that satisfy the condition are $78$ and $161$.
The sum of these values is $78 + 161 = 239$.

Let's ensure there are no subtleties missed.

The problem statement is clear. The sum of cubes formula is correct.
The interpretation of the remainder condition is correct.

Consider the modular arithmetic carefully.
The congruence $\frac{A}{B} \equiv C \pmod{m}$ is equivalent to $A \equiv BC \pmod{m}$, provided $\gcd(B, m) = 1$.

In our case, the congruence is $\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}$.
Here, $A = n^2(n+1)^2$, $B = 4$, $C = 17$, $m = n+5$.
The equivalence holds if $\gcd(4, n+5) = 1$.

If $\gcd(4, n+5) \neq 1$, then $n+5$ is divisible by $2$ or $4$.

Case 1: $n+5$ is divisible by $2$, so $n+5 = 2k$. $n = 2k-5$.
If $n=78$, $n+5 = 83$, $\gcd(4, 83) = 1$.
If $n=161$, $n+5 = 166$, $\gcd(4, 166) = 2$.
If $n=327$, $n+5 = 332$, $\gcd(4, 332) = 4$.

Let's reconsider the case $n=161$, where $n+5 = 166$.
The original congruence is $\frac{161^2 \cdot 162^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{166}$.
$S_{161} = 170067681$.
We need $170067681 \equiv 17 \pmod{166}$.
$170067681 - 17 = 170067664$.
$170067664 / 166 = 1024504$.
So, $170067664$ is divisible by $166$. The remainder is $0$.
This confirms that for $n=161$, the remainder is indeed $17$.

Let's consider the case $n=327$, where $n+5 = 332$.
The original congruence is $\frac{327^2 \cdot 328^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{332}$.
$S_{327} = 2876003984$.
We need $2876003984 \equiv 17 \pmod{332}$.
$2876003984 - 17 = 2876003967$.
$2876003967 / 332 = 8662662.55...$  Not an integer.

Let's verify the modular arithmetic when $\gcd(4, m) \neq 1$.

Consider the equation $\frac{A}{4} \equiv C \pmod{m}$.
This means $\frac{A}{4} - C = km$ for some integer $k$.
$A - 4C = 4km$
$A - 4C \equiv 0 \pmod{4m}$
$A \equiv 4C \pmod{4m}$

In our case, $A = n^2(n+1)^2$, $C = 17$, $m = n+5$.
We need $n^2(n+1)^2 \equiv 4 \cdot 17 \pmod{4(n+5)}$.
$n^2(n+1)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{4(n+5)}$.

If $n=161$, $n+5 = 166$. $4(n+5) = 664$.
We need $161^2 \cdot 162^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{664}$.
$161^2 \cdot 162^2 = 170067681$.
$170067681 - 68 = 170067613$.
$170067613 / 664 = 256126.525...$  Not an integer.

Something is inconsistent here.

Let's go back to the definition of remainder.
$S_n = q(n+5) + 17$.
$4S_n = 4q(n+5) + 68$.
$n^2(n+1)^2 = 4q(n+5) + 68$.
$n^2(n+1)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5}$. This step is always valid.

The error might be in the interpretation of the modular arithmetic.

The sum of all positive integers $n$.
The values of $n$ are $78$ and $161$.
Sum = $78 + 161 = 239$.
