Problem:
Patchouli is taking an exam with  $k > 1$  parts, numbered Part  $1, 2, \dots, k$ . It is known that for  $i = 1, 2, \dots, k$ , Part  $i$  contains  $i$  multiple choice questions, each of which has  $(i+1)$  answer choices. It is known that if she guesses randomly on every single question, the probability that she gets exactly one question correct is equal to  $2018$  times the probability that she gets no questions correct. Compute the number of questions that are on the exam.

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, let's see. So Patchouli has an exam with k parts, right? Each part i has i multiple-choice questions, each with (i+1) answer choices. She's guessing randomly on all questions, and the probability she gets exactly one question correct is 2018 times the probability she gets no questions correct. We need to find the total number of questions on the exam, which is the sum of questions in each part. So first, the total number of questions would be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k. But the key here is figuring out the value of k such that those two probabilities have that 2018:1 ratio.

So let me break this down. For each part i, there are i questions, each with (i+1) choices. So the probability of getting a question correct in part i is 1/(i+1), and the probability of getting it wrong is 1 - 1/(i+1) = i/(i+1). Now, since all questions are independent (since she's guessing randomly), the probabilities for correct/wrong answers multiply across questions.

But the problem is about the probability of getting exactly one question correct in the entire exam versus getting none correct. That seems like we have to compute these two probabilities in terms of k and set up the equation that one is 2018 times the other.

Let me denote P(0) as the probability that she gets no questions correct, and P(1) as the probability that she gets exactly one question correct. The given condition is P(1) = 2018 * P(0). We need to solve for k.

To calculate P(0), it's the product over all parts i, and for each part, the probability that she gets all i questions wrong. For each question in part i, the probability of getting it wrong is i/(i+1). Since each question in part i is independent, for part i, the probability of getting all i questions wrong is (i/(i+1))^i. Therefore, P(0) is the product from i=1 to k of (i/(i+1))^i.

Similarly, P(1) is the probability of getting exactly one question correct in the entire exam. So this would be the sum over all parts i and all questions in part i, of the probability that that specific question is correct and all others are wrong.

Since all parts and all questions within each part are independent, for each question in part i, the probability that this specific question is correct is 1/(i+1), and the probability that all other questions (including the other i-1 questions in part i and all questions in other parts) are wrong. Let's elaborate.

Consider a specific question in part i. The probability that this question is correct is 1/(i+1). The probability that the other i-1 questions in part i are wrong is (i/(i+1))^{i - 1}. For the other parts j ≠ i, each part j has j questions, each of which must be answered wrong. For part j, that probability is (j/(j+1))^j. So overall, for that one correct question in part i, the probability would be [1/(i+1)] * [ (i/(i+1))^{i - 1} ] * [ product_{j=1, j≠i}^k (j/(j+1))^j ].

But since there are i questions in part i, the total contribution from part i to P(1) is i * [1/(i+1)] * [ (i/(i+1))^{i - 1} ] * [ product_{j=1, j≠i}^k (j/(j+1))^j ].

However, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can simplify it. Let's note that P(0) is the product over j=1 to k of (j/(j+1))^j. Therefore, in the expression for P(1), for each part i, we have:

i * [1/(i+1)] * [ (i/(i+1))^{i - 1} ] * [ product_{j≠i} (j/(j+1))^j ] = i * [ (i/(i+1))^{i - 1} / (i + 1) ] * [ product_{j≠i} (j/(j+1))^j ].

Notice that [ (i/(i+1))^{i - 1} / (i + 1) ] = (i^{i - 1}/(i + 1)^{i - 1}) * 1/(i + 1) ) = i^{i - 1} / (i + 1)^i.

Therefore, each term in the sum for P(1) (for part i) is i^{i} / (i + 1)^i * product_{j≠i} (j/(j+1))^j.

But since the product over j≠i of (j/(j+1))^j is equal to P(0) divided by (i/(i+1))^i. Wait, because P(0) is the product over all j=1^k (j/(j+1))^j. So if I take P(0) and divide by the term (i/(i+1))^i, which is the contribution from part i, we get the product of all other terms. Therefore, the product_{j≠i} (j/(j+1))^j = P(0) / (i/(i+1))^i.

Therefore, substituting back into the expression for the contribution from part i:

i^{i}/(i + 1)^i * P(0) / (i/(i+1))^i ) = i^{i}/(i + 1)^i * P(0) * (i + 1)^i / i^i ) = P(0).

Wait, but then each term would be P(0), and multiplied by i? Wait, hold on. Let me double-check.

Starting over: for each question in part i, the probability of exactly that one question correct and all others wrong is:

[1/(i + 1)] (probability correct) * [ (i/(i + 1))^{i - 1} ] (probability the other i - 1 questions in part i wrong) * product_{j ≠ i} [ (j/(j + 1))^{j} ] (probability all questions in other parts wrong). So this is:

[1/(i + 1) * (i/(i + 1))^{i - 1} ] * product_{j=1}^k [ (j/(j + 1))^{j} ] divided by [ (i/(i + 1))^{i} ]... Wait, maybe not.

Wait, the entire P(0) is product_{j=1}^k [ (j/(j + 1))^{j} ], right?

So the term [ (i/(i + 1))^{i} ] is the contribution from part i in P(0). If in the case where we have one question correct in part i, then for part i, instead of all questions wrong, we have one question correct and i - 1 wrong. So for part i, the probability is C(i, 1) * [1/(i + 1)] * [ (i/(i + 1))^{i - 1} ].

Then, for other parts j ≠ i, we have (j/(j + 1))^{j} as before.

Therefore, P(1) can be written as sum_{i=1}^k [ C(i, 1) * (1/(i + 1)) * (i/(i + 1))^{i - 1} ) ] * product_{j=1, j≠i}^k (j/(j + 1))^{j}.

Which is sum_{i=1}^k [ i * (1/(i + 1)) * (i/(i + 1))^{i - 1} ) ] * [ P(0) / ( (i/(i + 1))^{i} ) ] ) because product_{j≠i} (j/(j + 1))^{j} = P(0) / ( (i/(i + 1))^{i} ) ).

Simplifying the term inside the sum: [ i * (1/(i + 1)) * (i^{i - 1}/(i + 1)^{i - 1}) ) ] / ( i^i / (i + 1)^i ) )

Calculating numerator: i * (1/(i + 1)) * i^{i - 1}/(i + 1)^{i - 1} ) = i^{i} / (i + 1)^i )

Denominator: i^i / (i + 1)^i )

Therefore, numerator/denominator is (i^{i}/(i+1)^i ) / (i^i/(i+1)^i )) = 1.

Therefore, each term in the sum is 1, and since there are i terms... Wait, no. Wait:

Wait, when we compute [expression] * P(0) / ( (i/(i+1))^i ), then the ratio becomes (numerator)/(denominator) * P(0):

So the "term" for part i is [i * 1/(i + 1) * (i/(i + 1))^{i -1}] * [ P(0) / ( (i/(i+1))^i ) ]

Simplify the first part: i * 1/(i +1 ) * (i/(i+1))^{i -1} = i * (i^{i -1}/(i +1)^{i}) ) = (i^i)/( (i + 1)^i )

The denominator is (i/(i +1))^i ) = (i^i)/(i +1)^i ), so dividing by this is equal to multiplying by ( (i +1)^i ) / i^i )

Thus, (i^i)/( (i +1)^i ) * ( (i +1)^i / i^i ) * P(0) ) = 1 * P(0). Therefore, each term in the sum for part i is i * something... Wait, no. Wait, the sum over i=1 to k of (i * [ (1/(i +1 )) * (i/(i +1 ))^{i -1} ] * product_{j≠i}(j/(j +1))^j ))

But when we substitute product_{j≠i}(j/(j +1))^j ) = P(0) / ( (i/(i +1))^i )

Then the term becomes (i * [ (1/(i +1 )) * (i/(i +1 ))^{i -1} ]) / ( (i/(i +1 ))^i ) ) * P(0)

Simplify the fraction:

(1/(i +1 )) * (i/(i +1 ))^{i -1} / ( (i/(i +1 ))^i ) = (1/(i +1 )) * (i/(i +1 ))^{ -1 } ) = (1/(i +1 )) * ( (i +1)/i ) ) = 1/i

Therefore, each part i contributes i * (1/i ) * P(0) = P(0 ).

Therefore, P(1) = sum_{i=1}^k P(0) = k * P(0)

But according to the problem, P(1) = 2018 * P(0). So k * P(0) = 2018 * P(0). Then, since P(0) is not zero (because there is a non-zero chance of getting all questions wrong), we can divide both sides by P(0), getting k = 2018. Therefore, the number of parts is 2018. Therefore, the total number of questions is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 2018.

But that sum is (2018)(2019)/2. Calculating that: 2018 * 2019 / 2.

Compute 2018 * 2019:

First, 2018 * 2000 = 4,036,000

2018 * 19 = 2018*(10 + 9) = 20,180 + 18,162 = 38,342

Therefore, 4,036,000 + 38,342 = 4,074,342

Then divide by 2: 4,074,342 / 2 = 2,037,171.

Hence, the total number of questions is 2,037,171.

Wait, but according to our earlier deduction, if the ratio is 2018, then k must be 2018, leading the total number of questions to be the sum from 1 to 2018. But just to ensure that the logic is correct.

Wait, the conclusion that P(1) = k * P(0) seemed surprising, but according to the computations above, for each part i, when you consider the probability of getting exactly one question correct in part i, the calculation collapses to P(0), so summing over all k parts, we get k * P(0).

But in that case, the total P(1) would be k * P(0), but in problem statement, P(1) = 2018 * P(0). So then k must be 2018.

Therefore, total number of questions is sum_{i=1}^{2018} i = 2018*2019/2 = 2018/2*2019=1009*2019. Compute 1009*2019:

Let me compute 1000 * 2019 = 2,019,000

9 * 2019 = 18,171

Adding up: 2,019,000 + 18,171 = 2,037,171. That's correct.

But we need to make sure that the result is this sum and not a different number. Let's recheck the reasoning.

So first, we define P(0) as the probability of getting all questions wrong, which is the product over each part i, of (i/(i+1))^i. Then, P(1) is the sum over each part i, of the probability of getting exactly one question correct in part i and all others wrong. But when we expanded P(1), the calculation led us to each term being equal to P(0), so the entire sum is k*P(0). Thus, k = 2018. Therefore, the total number of questions is 2018 parts, each with increasing number of questions: from 1 up to 2018, so the total is indeed the triangular number 2018*2019/2=2037171. Thus, the answer should be \boxed{2037171}.

But let me see if that makes sense. Let me do a smaller case. For example, if k=2.

Then total questions are 1 + 2 = 3.

Compute P(0): For part 1 (1 question with 2 choices), getting it wrong is 1/2. For part 2 (2 questions with 3 choices each), getting both wrong is (2/3)^2. So P(0)=1/2 * (4/9)= 2/9. P(1) would be the sum over: exactly one correct in part 1, rest wrong; or exactly one correct in part 2, rest wrong. But for part 1, getting exactly one correct (only one question) is 1/2; but since all others (part 2 must be all wrong), which is (2/3)^2. So that contributes 1/2 * 4/9 = 2/9. For part 2, getting exactly one correct: C(2,1)*(1/3)*(2/3)^1 * probability part 1 is wrong (which is 1/2). So 2*(1/3)*(2/3)*1/2 = (4/9)*(1/2) = 2/9. Then total P(1)=2/9 + 2/9=4/9. So P(1)/P(0)= (4/9)/(2/9)=2. Which is indeed k=2. So in this case, P(1)=k * P(0). Then for the given problem, P(1)=2018 * P(0) implies k=2018. So the total number of questions is 2018*2019/2=2037171. Looks correct. So answer is \boxed{2037171}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2037171}

So overall, for that one correct question in part i, the probability would be [1/(i+1)] * [ (i/(i+1))^{i - 1} ] * [ product_{j=1, j≠i}^k (j/(j+1))^j ].

But since there are i questions in part i, the total contribution from part i to P(1) is i * [1/(i+1)] * [ (i/(i+1))^{i - 1} ] * [ product_{j=1, j≠i}^k (j/(j+1))^j ].</text>

i * [1/(i+1)] * [ (i/(i+1))^{i - 1} ] * [ product_{j≠i} (j/(j+1))^j ] = i * [ (i/(i+1))^{i - 1} / (i + 1) ] * [ product_{j≠i} (j/(j+1))^j ].

Notice that [ (i/(i+1))^{i - 1} / (i + 1) ] = (i^{i - 1}/(i + 1)^{i - 1}) * 1/(i + 1) ) = i^{i - 1} / (i + 1)^i.

Therefore, each term in the sum for P(1) (for part i) is i^{i} / (i + 1)^i * product_{j≠i} (j/(j+1))^j.</text>

Therefore, each part i contributes i * (1/i ) * P(0) = P(0 ).

Therefore, P(1) = sum_{i=1}^k P(0) = k * P(0)

But according to the problem, P(1) = 2018 * P(0). So k * P(0) = 2018 * P(0). Then, since P(0) is not zero (because there is a non-zero chance of getting all questions wrong), we can divide both sides by P(0), getting k = 2018.</text>

So if I take P(0) and divide by the term (i/(i+1))^i, which is the contribution from part i, we get the product of all other terms. Therefore, the product_{j≠i} (j/(j+1))^j = P(0) / (i/(i+1))^i.

Therefore, substituting back into the expression for the contribution from part i:

i^{i}/(i + 1)^i * P(0) / (i/(i+1))^i ) = i^{i}/(i + 1)^i * P(0) * (i + 1)^i / i^i ) = P(0).</text>

2018 * 19 = 2018*(10 + 9) = 20,180 + 18,162 = 38,342

Then total questions are 1 + 2 = 3.

Compute P(0): For part 1 (1 question with 2 choices), getting it wrong is 1/2. For part 2 (2 questions with 3 choices each), getting both wrong is (2/3)^2. So P(0)=1/2 * (4/9)= 2/9. P(1) would be the sum over: exactly one correct in part 1, rest wrong; or exactly one correct in part 2, rest wrong. But for part 1, getting exactly one correct (only one question) is 1/2; but since all others (part 2 must be all wrong), which is (2/3)^2. So that contributes 1/2 * 4/9 = 2/9. For part 2, getting exactly one correct: C(2,1)*(1/3)*(2/3)^1 * probability part 1 is wrong (which is 1/2). So 2*(1/3)*(2/3)*1/2 = (4/9)*(1/2) = 2/9. Then total P(1)=2/9 + 2/9=4/9.
