Problem:
Assume the Black-Scholes framework. For $t \ge 0$, let $S(t)$ be the time-$t$ price of a nondividend-paying stock. You are given:
(i) $S(0)=0.5
(ii) The stock price process is $\frac{dS(t)}{S(t)} = 0.05dt+0.2dZ(t)$ where $Z(t)$ is a standart Brownian motion.
(iii) $E[S(1)^\alpha]=1.4$, where $\alpha$ is a negative constant.
(iv) The continuously compounded risk-free interest rate is $3%$.
Consider a contingent claim that pays $S(1)^\alpha$ at time 1. What is the time-0 price of the contigent claim?

<explanation>The solver has recognized that this problem operates within the Black-Scholes framework, which is a mathematical model used for pricing financial derivatives. The final answer of 1.372 indicates the solver understood the framework and applied the appropriate pricing methodology for contingent claims within this context.</explanation>

<end>7</end>
<text>1.372</text>
<explanation>The final answer indicates the solver has applied risk-neutral pricing principles correctly. In the Black-Scholes framework, the time-0 price of a contingent claim is the expected payoff under the risk-neutral measure, discounted at the risk-free rate. The value 1.372 represents e^(-0.03) × 1.4, showing the solver discounted the expected payoff (1.4) by the risk-free rate (3%).</explanation>

<text>1.372</text>
<explanation>The solver has synthesized several pieces of information: the expected value of S(1)^α is 1.4, the risk-free rate is 3%, and the payment occurs at time 1. They recognized that under the Black-Scholes framework, the time-0 price is the discounted expected value of the payoff, leading to the calculation e^(-0.03) × 1.4 = 1.372.</explanation>
