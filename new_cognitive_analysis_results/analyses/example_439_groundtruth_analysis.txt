Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
### Part (a)

1. **If \( x^{-1}y \in H \):**

   Suppose \( x^{-1}y \in H \). Then there exists some \( h' \in H \) such that \( x^{-1}y = h' \). We need to show that \( H^x = H^y \).

   \[
   H^x = \{ xhx^{-1} \mid h \in H \}
   \]

   Since \( y = xh' \), we have:

   \[
   H^y = \{ yhy^{-1} \mid h \in H \} = \{ (xh')h(xh')^{-1} \mid h \in H \}
   \]

   Simplifying, we get:

   \[
   H^y = \{ x(h'h)h'^{-1}x^{-1} \mid h \in H \} = \{ xhh'x^{-1} \mid h \in H \}
   \]

   Since \( h' \in H \) and \( H \) is closed under multiplication, \( hh' \in H \). Therefore, we can write:

   \[
   H^y = \{ xhx^{-1} \mid h \in H \} = H^x
   \]

   Thus, \( H^x = H^y \).

2. **If \( H^x = H^y \):**

   Suppose \( H^x = H^y \). We need to show that \( x^{-1}y \in H \).

   Since \( H^x = H^y \), for every \( h \in H \), there exists \( h' \in H \) such that:

   \[
   xhx^{-1} = yh'y^{-1}
   \]

   This implies:

   \[
   y^{-1}xhx^{-1}y = h'
   \]

   Therefore, \( H^{y^{-1}x} = \{ (y^{-1}x)h(x^{-1}y) \mid h \in H \} = H \).

   Since \( H^{y^{-1}x} = H \), it follows that \( y^{-1}x \in H \). Hence, \( x^{-1}y \in H \).

   \(\blacksquare\)

### Part (b)

1. **Claim: For all \( x, y \in G \) with \( x^{-1}y \not\in H \), we have \( H^x \cap H^y = \{e\} \):**

   Assume otherwise. Then there exist \( h_1, h_2 \in H \) with \( h_1, h_2 \neq e \) such that:

   \[
   xh_1x^{-1} = yh_2y^{-1}
   \]

   This implies:

   \[
   (y^{-1}x)h_1(x^{-1}y) = h_2
   \]

   But now \( H^{y^{-1}x} \) contains \( h_2 \neq e \), which contradicts the assumption that \( H^{y^{-1}x} \cap H = \{e\} \).

2. **Conclusion: For all \( x, y \in G \), either \( H^x = H^y \) or \( H^x \cap H^y = \{e\} \):**

   For each \( x \in G \), the set \( G_x = \{ y \in G \mid H^x = H^y \} \) has cardinality \( n \) (there are exactly \( n \) such \( y \in G \) because \( H \) has \( n \) elements).

   Thus, the \( G_x \) define equivalence classes, and there are \( \frac{m}{n} \) such equivalence classes.

3. **Number of elements in \( \bigcup_{x \in G} H^x \):**

   Each equivalence class contributes \( n - 1 \) non-identity elements (since \( H \) has \( n \) elements including the identity). Therefore, the total number of elements in \( \bigcup_{x \in G} H^x \) is:

   \[
   1 + \frac{m}{n}(n - 1)
   \]

   where the \( 1 \) accounts for the identity element.

The final answer is \( \boxed{ 1 + \frac{m}{n}(n - 1) } \)
