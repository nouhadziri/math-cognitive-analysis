Problem:
Consider a hexagon with vertices labeled  $M$ ,  $M$ ,  $A$ ,  $T$ ,  $H$ ,  $S$  in that order. Clayton starts at the  $M$  adjacent to  $M$  and  $A$ , and writes the letter down. Each second, Clayton moves to an adjacent vertex, each with probability  $\frac{1}{2}$ , and writes down the corresponding letter. Clayton stops moving when the string he's written down contains the letters  $M, A, T$ , and  $H$  in that order, not necessarily consecutively (for example, one valid string might be  $MAMMSHTH$ .) What is the expected length of the string Clayton wrote?

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the expected length of a string generated by a random walk on the vertices of a hexagon, where the walk stops when the letters $M, A, T, H$ appear in that order in the generated string. The vertices of the hexagon are labeled $M_1, M_2, A, T, H, S$ in order. Clayton starts at one of the $M$ vertices, specifically the one adjacent to $M$ and $A$. Let the vertices be $V_1=M_1, V_2=M_2, V_3=A, V_4=T, V_5=H, V_6=S$. Clayton starts at $M_2$.

The order of the vertices is $M_1 - M_2 - A - T - H - S - M_1$.
The starting vertex is $M_2$.

The target sequence is $M, A, T, H$. The letters associated with the vertices are $M, M, A, T, H, S$.

Let the state of the process be the longest prefix of the target sequence $M, A, T, H$ that has been formed as a subsequence of the generated string. The states are $\emptyset, M, MA, MAT, MATH$. The process stops when the state is $MATH$.

Let $E_s$ be the expected number of additional steps needed to reach the stopping condition starting from a state $s$ at a particular vertex. The state $s$ represents the longest prefix of $MATH$ formed so far.

The vertices are:
1: $M$
2: $M$
3: $A$
4: $T$
5: $H$
6: $S$

Clayton starts at vertex 2 ($M$). The initial state is $\emptyset$.

Let $E(v, s)$ be the expected number of additional steps to reach the stopping condition when currently at vertex $v$ and the current state is $s$. The states are $\emptyset, M, MA, MAT$. The absorbing state is $MATH$.

We are looking for $E(2, \emptyset)$.

Transitions between states:
- If the current state is $\emptyset$:
  - If the current vertex is $M_1$ or $M_2$, the next state is $M$.
  - Otherwise, the next state remains $\emptyset$.
- If the current state is $M$:
  - If the current vertex is $A$, the next state is $MA$.
  - Otherwise, the next state remains $M$.
- If the current state is $MA$:
  - If the current vertex is $T$, the next state is $MAT$.
  - Otherwise, the next state remains $MA$.
- If the current state is $MAT$:
  - If the current vertex is $H$, the next state is $MATH$ (stopping condition).
  - Otherwise, the next state remains $MAT$.

Let $E_{\emptyset}(v)$ be the expected number of additional steps to reach the stopping condition from vertex $v$ when the current state is $\emptyset$.
Let $E_{M}(v)$ be the expected number of additional steps to reach the stopping condition from vertex $v$ when the current state is $M$.
Let $E_{MA}(v)$ be the expected number of additional steps to reach the stopping condition from vertex $v$ when the current state is $MA$.
Let $E_{MAT}(v)$ be the expected number of additional steps to reach the stopping condition from vertex $v$ when the current state is $MAT$.

We have the following equations:
$E_{\emptyset}(v) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{\emptyset}(neighbor_1) + \frac{1}{2} E_{\emptyset}(neighbor_2)$ if the letter at vertex $v$ is not $M$.
$E_{\emptyset}(v) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(neighbor_1) + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(neighbor_2)$ if the letter at vertex $v$ is $M$.

$E_{M}(v) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(neighbor_1) + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(neighbor_2)$ if the letter at vertex $v$ is not $A$.
$E_{M}(v) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(neighbor_1) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(neighbor_2)$ if the letter at vertex $v$ is $A$.

$E_{MA}(v) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(neighbor_1) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(neighbor_2)$ if the letter at vertex $v$ is not $T$.
$E_{MA}(v) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(neighbor_1) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(neighbor_2)$ if the letter at vertex $v$ is $T$.

$E_{MAT}(v) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(neighbor_1) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(neighbor_2)$ if the letter at vertex $v$ is not $H$.
$E_{MAT}(v) = 0$ if the letter at vertex $v$ is $H$ (stopping condition).

The neighbors of each vertex:
1: 6, 2 (S, M)
2: 1, 3 (M, A)
3: 2, 4 (M, T)
4: 3, 5 (A, H)
5: 4, 6 (T, S)
6: 5, 1 (H, M)

Equations for state $\emptyset$:
$E_{\emptyset}(1) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(6) + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(2)$
$E_{\emptyset}(2) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(1) + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(3)$
$E_{\emptyset}(3) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{\emptyset}(2) + \frac{1}{2} E_{\emptyset}(4)$
$E_{\emptyset}(4) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{\emptyset}(3) + \frac{1}{2} E_{\emptyset}(5)$
$E_{\emptyset}(5) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{\emptyset}(4) + \frac{1}{2} E_{\emptyset}(6)$
$E_{\emptyset}(6) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{\emptyset}(5) + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(1)$

Equations for state $M$:
$E_{M}(1) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(6) + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(2)$
$E_{M}(2) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(1) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(3)$
$E_{M}(3) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(2) + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(4)$
$E_{M}(4) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(3) + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(5)$
$E_{M}(5) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(4) + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(6)$
$E_{M}(6) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(5) + \frac{1}{2} E_{M}(1)$

Equations for state $MA$:
$E_{MA}(1) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(6) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(2)$
$E_{MA}(2) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(1) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(3)$
$E_{MA}(3) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(2) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(4)$
$E_{MA}(4) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(3) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(5)$
$E_{MA}(5) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(4) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(6)$
$E_{MA}(6) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(5) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MA}(1)$

Equations for state $MAT$:
$E_{MAT}(1) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(6) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(2)$
$E_{MAT}(2) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(1) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(3)$
$E_{MAT}(3) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(2) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(4)$
$E_{MAT}(4) = 0$
$E_{MAT}(5) = 0$
$E_{MAT}(6) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(5) + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(1) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_{MAT}(1)$

Solving for $E_{MAT}$:
Let $x_i = E_{MAT}(i)$.
$x_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_6 + \frac{1}{2} x_2$
$x_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_1 + \frac{1}{2} x_3$
$x_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_2 + \frac{1}{2} x_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_2$
$x_4 = 0$
$x_5 = 0$
$x_6 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_1$

Substitute $x_3$: $x_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_1 + \frac{1}{2} (1 + \frac{1}{2} x_2) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} x_2$
$\frac{3}{4} x_2 = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2} x_1 \implies 3 x_2 = 6 + 2 x_1 \implies x_2 = 2 + \frac{2}{3} x_1$

Substitute $x_6$: $x_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (1 + \frac{1}{2} x_1) + \frac{1}{2} x_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} x_1 + \frac{1}{2} x_2 = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{4} x_1 + \frac{1}{2} x_2$
$\frac{3}{4} x_1 = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2} x_2 \implies 3 x_1 = 6 + 2 x_2$

Substitute $x_2$: $3 x_1 = 6 + 2 (2 + \frac{2}{3} x_1) = 6 + 4 + \frac{4}{3} x_1 = 10 + \frac{4}{3} x_1$
$3 x_1 - \frac{4}{3} x_1 = 10 \implies \frac{5}{3} x_1 = 10 \implies x_1 = 6$.
$x_2 = 2 + \frac{2}{3} (6) = 2 + 4 = 6$.
$x_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (6) = 4$.
$x_6 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (6) = 4$.

So, $E_{MAT}(1) = 6, E_{MAT}(2) = 6, E_{MAT}(3) = 4, E_{MAT}(4) = 0, E_{MAT}(5) = 0, E_{MAT}(6) = 4$.

Now, solve for $E_{MA}$. Let $y_i = E_{MA}(i)$.
$y_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} y_6 + \frac{1}{2} y_2$
$y_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} y_1 + \frac{1}{2} y_3$
$y_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_2 + \frac{1}{2} x_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (6) + 0 = 4$
$y_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_3 + \frac{1}{2} y_5 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (4) + \frac{1}{2} y_5 = 3 + \frac{1}{2} y_5$
$y_5 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} y_4 + \frac{1}{2} y_6$
$y_6 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} y_5 + \frac{1}{2} y_1$

Substitute $y_3 = 4$:
$y_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} y_1 + 2 = 3 + \frac{1}{2} y_1$

Using symmetry, $y_1 = y_6$, $y_4 = y_5$.
$y_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} y_1 + \frac{1}{2} y_2 \implies \frac{1}{2} y_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} y_2 \implies y_1 = 2 + y_2$
$y_1 = 2 + (3 + \frac{1}{2} y_1) = 5 + \frac{1}{2} y_1 \implies \frac{1}{2} y_1 = 5 \implies y_1 = 10$.
$y_2 = 3 + \frac{1}{2} (10) = 8$.

$y_4 = 3 + \frac{1}{2} y_5$. Since $y_4 = y_5$, $y_4 = 3 + \frac{1}{2} y_4 \implies \frac{1}{2} y_4 = 3 \implies y_4 = 6$.

So, $E_{MA}(1) = 10, E_{MA}(2) = 8, E_{MA}(3) = 4, E_{MA}(4) = 6, E_{MA}(5) = 6, E_{MA}(6) = 10$.

Now, solve for $E_{M}$. Let $z_i = E_{M}(i)$.
$z_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} z_6 + \frac{1}{2} z_2$
$z_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} y_1 + \frac{1}{2} y_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (10) + \frac{1}{2} (4) = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8$
$z_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} y_2 + \frac{1}{2} z_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (8) + \frac{1}{2} z_4 = 5 + \frac{1}{2} z_4$
$z_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} z_3 + \frac{1}{2} z_5$
$z_5 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} z_4 + \frac{1}{2} z_6$
$z_6 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} z_5 + \frac{1}{2} z_1$

By symmetry, $z_1 = z_6$, $z_3 = z_5$.
$z_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} z_1 + \frac{1}{2} z_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} z_1 + \frac{1}{2} (8) = 5 + \frac{1}{2} z_1 \implies \frac{1}{2} z_1 = 5 \implies z_1 = 10$.
$z_6 = 10$.

$z_3 = 5 + \frac{1}{2} z_4$
$z_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} z_3 + \frac{1}{2} z_3 = 1 + z_3$
$z_3 = 5 + \frac{1}{2} (1 + z_3) = 5 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} z_3 = \frac{11}{2} + \frac{1}{2} z_3$
$\frac{1}{2} z_3 = \frac{11}{2} \implies z_3 = 11$.
$z_5 = 11$.
$z_4 = 1 + 11 = 12$.

So, $E_{M}(1) = 10, E_{M}(2) = 8, E_{M}(3) = 11, E_{M}(4) = 12, E_{M}(5) = 11, E_{M}(6) = 10$.

Finally, solve for $E_{\emptyset}$. Let $w_i = E_{\emptyset}(i)$.
$w_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} z_6 + \frac{1}{2} z_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (10) + \frac{1}{2} (8) = 1 + 5 + 4 = 10$
$w_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} z_1 + \frac{1}{2} z_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (10) + \frac{1}{2} (11) = 1 + 5 + 5.5 = 11.5$
$w_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} w_2 + \frac{1}{2} w_4$
$w_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} w_3 + \frac{1}{2} w_5$
$w_5 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} w_4 + \frac{1}{2} w_6$
$w_6 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} w_5 + \frac{1}{2} z_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} w_5 + 5 = 6 + \frac{1}{2} w_5$

By symmetry, $w_3 = w_5$.
$w_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} w_2 + \frac{1}{2} w_4$
$w_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} w_3 + \frac{1}{2} w_3 = 1 + w_3$

$w_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (11.5) + \frac{1}{2} (1 + w_3) = 1 + 5.75 + 0.5 + 0.5 w_3 = 7.25 + 0.5 w_3$
$0.5 w_3 = 7.25 \implies w_3 = 14.5$.
$w_5 = 14.5$.
$w_4 = 1 + 14.5 = 15.5$.
$w_6 = 6 + \frac{1}{2} (14.5) = 6 + 7.25 = 13.25$.

The expected length of the string is the expected number of steps until stopping.
Clayton starts at vertex 2, state $\emptyset$. The expected length is $E_{\emptyset}(2)$.
$E_{\emptyset}(2) = w_2 = 11.5$.

Let's double-check the logic. The expected length is the expected number of steps.
When we are in state $s$ at vertex $v$, $E_s(v)$ is the expected number of additional steps.

Alternative approach: linearity of expectation.

Let $T_1$ be the number of steps to get the first $M$.
Let $T_2$ be the number of steps after the first $M$ to get the first $A$.
Let $T_3$ be the number of steps after the first $A$ to get the first $T$.
Let $T_4$ be the number of steps after the first $T$ to get the first $H$.

The expected length is $E[T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_4] = E[T_1] + E[T_2] + E[T_3] + E[T_4]$.

Consider the expected hitting time between states in the random walk.
Let $h_{ij}$ be the expected number of steps to reach state $j$ starting from state $i$.

Expected time to get the first $M$:
Start at vertex 2. Target vertices are 1 and 2.
Let $e_i$ be the expected time to hit $\{1, 2\}$ starting from vertex $i$.
$e_1 = 0, e_2 = 0$.
$e_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} e_2 + \frac{1}{2} e_4 = 1 + 0 + \frac{1}{2} e_4$
$e_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} e_3 + \frac{1}{2} e_5$
$e_5 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} e_4 + \frac{1}{2} e_6$
$e_6 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} e_5 + \frac{1}{2} e_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} e_5$

Symmetry: $e_3 = e_6, e_4 = e_5$.
$e_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} e_4$
$e_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} e_3 + \frac{1}{2} e_4 \implies \frac{1}{2} e_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} e_3 \implies e_4 = 2 + e_3$
$e_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} (2 + e_3) = 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} e_3 = 2 + \frac{1}{2} e_3$
$\frac{1}{2} e_3 = 2 \implies e_3 = 4$.
$e_4 = 2 + 4 = 6$.

Expected time to get the first $M$ starting from vertex 2 is 0. This is wrong.

Let $E_i$ be the expected number of steps to produce the letter $M$ starting from vertex $i$.
If at $M$, we have produced $M$ in 0 steps.
$E_1 = 0, E_2 = 0$.
$E_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_2 + \frac{1}{2} E_4 = 1 + 0 + \frac{1}{2} E_4$
$E_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_3 + \frac{1}{2} E_5$
$E_5 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_4 + \frac{1}{2} E_6$
$E_6 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_5 + \frac{1}{2} E_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E_5$
Same equations as before, so $E_3 = 4, E_4 = 6, E_5 = 6, E_6 = 4$.

Expected time to get the first $A$ after getting the first $M$.
Conditioned on being at a vertex after getting the first $M$.

Consider the sequence of visited vertices. Stop when the letters $M, A, T, H$ appear in order.

The state space approach seems more robust.
The expected length is the expected stopping time.

Let's check the calculation for $E_{MAT}$.
If we are at vertex 4 or 5 (T or H), and the state is $MAT$, we stop at the next step with probability 1/2 if we move to H.

<text>Solving for $E_{MAT}$:
Let $x_i = E_{MAT}(i)$.
$x_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_6 + \frac{1}{2} x_2$
$x_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_1 + \frac{1}{2} x_3$
$x_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_2 + \frac{1}{2} x_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_2$
$x_4 = 0$
$x_5 = 0$
$x_6 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_1$

Substitute $x_3$: $x_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_1 + \frac{1}{2} (1 + \frac{1}{2} x_2) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} x_1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} x_2$
$\frac{3}{4} x_2 = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2} x_1 \implies 3 x_2 = 6 + 2 x_1 \implies x_2 = 2 + \frac{2}{3} x_1$</text>
