Problem:
Let  $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb R$  be a continuous function such that  $f(0)=f(1)=0$ . Prove that the set  $$ A:=\{h\in[0,1]:f(x+h)=f(x)\text{ for some }x\in[0,1]\} $$  is Lebesgue measureable and has Lebesgue measure at least  $\frac12$ .

Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Measurability of \( A \)**: Since \( f \) is continuous on \([0,1]\), the set \( A \) defined as \( A := \{h \in [0,1] : f(x+h) = f(x) \text{ for some } x \in [0,1]\} \) is measurable. This follows from the fact that the preimage of a measurable set under a continuous function is measurable.

2. **Definition of \( B \)**: Define the set \( B \) as \( B := \{ h \in [0,1] : 1-h \in A \} \). Notice that \( B \) is essentially a reflection of \( A \) around \( \frac{1}{2} \). Since \( A \) is measurable, \( B \) is also measurable and has the same measure as \( A \).

3. **Union of \( A \) and \( B \)**: We need to show that \( A \cup B = [0,1] \). For any \( h \in [0,1] \), consider the function \( r(x) \) defined as:
   \[
   r(x) = 
   \begin{cases} 
   f(x+h) - f(x) & \text{if } x+h \leq 1 \\
   f(x+1-h) - f(x) & \text{if } x+h > 1 
   \end{cases}
   \]
   Since \( f(1) = f(0) \), \( r \) is continuous on \([0,1]\).

4. **Intermediate Value Theorem**: Let \( f(a) = \max f \) and \( f(b) = \min f \). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, since \( r \) is continuous and \( r(a) \times r(b) \leq 0 \), there exists some \( c \) between \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( r(c) = 0 \). This implies that for some \( x \in [0,1] \), \( f(x+h) = f(x) \) or \( f(x+1-h) = f(x) \), ensuring that \( h \in A \) or \( 1-h \in A \). Therefore, \( h \in A \cup B \).

5. **Measure Calculation**: Since \( A \cup B = [0,1] \), we have:
   \[
   \mu(A \cup B) = \mu([0,1]) = 1
   \]
   Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for measures, we get:
   \[
   \mu(A \cup B) = \mu(A) + \mu(B) - \mu(A \cap B)
   \]
   Given that \( \mu(A) = \mu(B) \), let \( \mu(A) = \mu(B) = m \). Then:
   \[
   1 = 2m - \mu(A \cap B)
   \]
   Since \( \mu(A \cap B) \geq 0 \), we have:
   \[
   1 \leq 2m \implies m \geq \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the Lebesgue measure of \( A \) is at least \( \frac{1}{2} \).

The final answer is \( \boxed{ \mu(A) \geq \frac{1}{2} } \).
