Problem:
Take the following differential equation:
\[3(3+x^2)\frac{dx}{dt}=2(1+x^2)^2e^{-t^2}\]
If  $x(0)\leq 1$ , prove that there exists  $M>0$  such that  $|x(t)|<M$  for all  $t\geq 0$ .

Domain: Differential equations

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Alright, let's take a look at this differential equation. The problem states:

\[3(3+x^2)\frac{dx}{dt}=2(1+x^2)^2e^{-t^2}\]

With the initial condition \(x(0) \leq 1\), we need to prove that there exists some \(M > 0\) such that \(|x(t)| < M\) for all \(t \geq 0\). So basically, we need to show that the solution \(x(t)\) doesn't blow up to infinity in finite time or as \(t\) approaches infinity; it stays bounded for all future time.

First, I should probably try to write the differential equation in a more manageable form. Let's see, the equation is separable, right? Because the left-hand side involves \(x\) terms multiplied by \(dx/dt\), and the right-hand side is a function of \(t\) multiplied by another function of \(x\). So maybe I can separate the variables and integrate both sides.

Let me rewrite the equation:

\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{2(1 + x^2)^2}{3(3 + x^2)} e^{-t^2} \]

Yes, so we can write this as:

\[ \frac{3(3 + x^2)}{2(1 + x^2)^2} dx = e^{-t^2} dt \]

So, integrating both sides, we get:

\[ \int_{x(0)}^{x(t)} \frac{3(3 + x^2)}{2(1 + x^2)^2} dx = \int_{0}^{t} e^{-\tau^2} d\tau \]

Hmm, okay. The right-hand side integral is the error function, which is known to converge to \(\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\) as \(t \rightarrow \infty\) because \(\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\tau^2} d\tau = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\). So the integral from 0 to infinity is finite. That’s useful information.

Now, the left-hand side integral involves a rational function of \(x\). Let's try to compute that integral. Maybe perform partial fractions or some substitution. Let's see:

\[ \frac{3(3 + x^2)}{2(1 + x^2)^2} \]

Let me note that the numerator is of degree 2, and the denominator is degree 4. Hmm, but since it's a rational function, partial fractions might be necessary. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution. Let me see if I can manipulate the numerator to write in terms of the denominator.

First, note that:

\(3 + x^2 = 3(1) + x^2\)

But the denominator is \((1 + x^2)^2\). Maybe split the numerator:

\[ \frac{3(3 + x^2)}{2(1 + x^2)^2} = \frac{3}{2} \left( \frac{3 + x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} \right) \]

Let me split this into two terms:

\[ \frac{3 + x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} = \frac{3}{(1 + x^2)^2} + \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} \]

Then:

\[ \frac{3}{(1 + x^2)^2} + \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} = \frac{3}{(1 + x^2)^2} + \frac{(1 + x^2) - 1}{(1 + x^2)^2} \]

Wait, hold on:

\(x^2 = (1 + x^2) - 1\), so substituting that in:

\[ \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} = \frac{(1 + x^2) - 1}{(1 + x^2)^2} = \frac{1}{1 + x^2} - \frac{1}{(1 + x^2)^2} \]

Therefore, substituting back:

\[ \frac{3 + x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} = \frac{3}{(1 + x^2)^2} + \frac{1}{1 + x^2} - \frac{1}{(1 + x^2)^2} \]

Simplify:

\[ = \left(3 - 1\right) \frac{1}{(1 + x^2)^2} + \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \]
\[ = \frac{2}{(1 + x^2)^2} + \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \]

So now, the integral becomes:

\[ \frac{3}{2} \int \left( \frac{2}{(1 + x^2)^2} + \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \right) dx \]

Simplify constants:

\[ \frac{3}{2} \left( 2 \int \frac{dx}{(1 + x^2)^2} + \int \frac{dx}{1 + x^2} \right) \]
\[ = 3 \int \frac{dx}{(1 + x^2)^2} + \frac{3}{2} \int \frac{dx}{1 + x^2} \]

These are standard integrals. The integral of \(\frac{1}{1 + x^2}\) is \(\tan^{-1}x + C\). The integral of \(\frac{1}{(1 + x^2)^2}\) can be computed using a reduction formula or using substitution. Let me recall:

Integration of \(\frac{1}{(1 + x^2)^2} dx\). Using the substitution \(x = \tan \theta\), then \(dx = \sec^2 \theta d\theta\), and the integral becomes:

\[ \int \frac{\sec^2 \theta}{(1 + \tan^2 \theta)^2} d\theta = \int \frac{\sec^2 \theta}{(\sec^2 \theta)^2} d\theta = \int \cos^2 \theta d\theta = \frac{1}{2} (\theta + \sin \theta \cos \theta) + C \]

Then substituting back:

\(\theta = \tan^{-1} x\), so \(\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\), \(\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\). Therefore,

\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \tan^{-1} x + \frac{x}{1 + x^2} \right) + C \]

Therefore, the integral of \( \frac{1}{(1 + x^2)^2} dx \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \tan^{-1} x + \frac{x}{1 + x^2} \right) + C \).

Putting this back into our expression, we have:

Left-hand side integral:

\[ 3 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left( \tan^{-1} x + \frac{x}{1 + x^2} \right) + \frac{3}{2} \tan^{-1} x + C \]
\[ = \frac{3}{2} \tan^{-1} x + \frac{3x}{2(1 + x^2)} + \frac{3}{2} \tan^{-1} x + C \]
\[ = \frac{3}{2} \tan^{-1} x + \frac{3x}{2(1 + x^2)} + \frac{3}{2} \tan^{-1} x + C \]
Wait, that seems redundant. Wait, no:

Wait, actually, the original integral:

The integral of \( \frac{1}{(1 + x^2)^2} \) is \( \frac{1}{2} (\tan^{-1} x + \frac{x}{1 + x^2}) \), so when multiplied by 3, we get:

\( 3 \times \frac{1}{2} \tan^{-1} x + 3 \times \frac{1}{2} \frac{x}{1 + x^2} \)

Then plus the other integral, which is \( \frac{3}{2} \tan^{-1} x \)

Therefore total:

\( \frac{3}{2} \tan^{-1} x + \frac{3x}{2(1 + x^2)} + \frac{3}{2} \tan^{-1} x \)

Which combines to:

\( (\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2}) \tan^{-1} x + \frac{3x}{2(1 + x^2)} \)

Which is:

\( 3 \tan^{-1}x + \frac{3x}{2(1 + x^2)} \)

Therefore, the integral on the left-hand side is:

\[ 3 \tan^{-1}x + \frac{3x}{2(1 + x^2)} + C \]

So putting it all together, the integrated equation is:

\[ 3 \tan^{-1}x(t) + \frac{3x(t)}{2(1 + x(t)^2)} - \left[ 3 \tan^{-1}x(0) + \frac{3x(0)}{2(1 + x(0)^2)} \right] = \int_{0}^{t} e^{-\tau^2} d\tau \]

Since \( \int_{0}^{t} e^{-\tau^2} d\tau \) is less than \( \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \) for all \( t \), because as \( t \to \infty \), the integral approaches \( \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \). Therefore, the right-hand side is bounded above by \( \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \).

Thus, if we can show that the left-hand side must also remain bounded, even as \( t \to \infty \), then perhaps \( x(t) \) can't blow up. Let me consider the left-hand side as \( x \) becomes large. Suppose that \( x(t) \to \infty \). What happens to the left-hand side?

Compute the limit as \( x \to \infty \):

First, \( \tan^{-1} x \) approaches \( \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Second, \( \frac{x}{1 + x^2} \) behaves like \( \frac{1}{x} \), which approaches 0.

Therefore, \( 3 \tan^{-1}x + \frac{3x}{2(1 + x^2)} \) approaches \( 3 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} + 0 = \frac{3\pi}{2} \).

Similarly, if \( x \to -\infty \), then \( \tan^{-1}x \to -\frac{\pi}{2} \), and \( \frac{x}{1 + x^2} \to 0 \) as well.

So for \( x \to -\infty \), the limit is \( -\frac{3\pi}{2} + 0 = -\frac{3\pi}{2} \).

But the integral from the right-hand side is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \).

Given that the equation equals the right-hand side, which is positive and bounded, but let me think again about the left-hand side when \( x \) is large.

Suppose \( x(t) \) becomes very large, then the left-hand side approaches either \( \frac{3\pi}{2} - C \) or \( -\frac{3\pi}{2} - C \), where \( C = 3 \tan^{-1}x(0) + \frac{3x(0)}{2(1 + x(0)^2)} \).

But since \( x(0) \leq 1 \), then \( \tan^{-1}x(0) \leq \tan^{-1}1 = \frac{\pi}{4} \), and \( \frac{x(0)}{1 + x(0)^2} \) is also bounded (the function \( \frac{x}{1 + x^2} \) has maximum at \( x = 1 \), where it is \( \frac{1}{2} \), and minimum at \( x = -1 \), \( -\frac{1}{2} \)), but since \( x(0) \leq 1 \), it could be negative if \( x(0) \) is negative. Wait, actually, the problem says \( x(0) \leq 1 \), but doesn't specify a lower bound. Hmm. But \( x(0) \) could be negative. Let me see.

But regardless, the key is that if \( x(t) \) were to approach infinity, then the left-hand side would approach \( \frac{3\pi}{2} - C \), right? Let's compute \( C \):

Suppose \( x(0) \leq 1 \). Then, \( \tan^{-1}x(0) \leq \tan^{-1}1 = \frac{\pi}{4} \) if \( x(0) \geq 0 \), but if \( x(0) \) is negative, then \( \tan^{-1}x(0) \) would be negative. However, let me note that in the initial condition, \( x(0) \leq 1 \), which includes both positive and negative possibilities, unless otherwise specified.

But since x(0) can be negative, perhaps?

Wait, no, actually, hold on. The problem states "If \( x(0) \leq 1 \)", so the initial value is <=1, which could be any real number less than or equal to 1. So x(0) can be negative, but not greater than 1.

But in any case, even if x(0) is, say, -infinity... Wait, no, the initial condition is x(0) <=1, but in reality, the solution must be starting at x(0), which is some real number <=1.

Therefore, C is a finite value, depending on x(0). So the left-hand side is equal to the integral from 0 to t of e^{-tau^2} dtau, which is bounded above by sqrt(pi)/2.

Now, suppose that x(t) tends to infinity. Then the left-hand side tends to 3*(pi/2) - C. So as x(t) approaches infinity, the left-hand side increases towards (3pi/2 - C). However, the right-hand side is only as big as sqrt(pi)/2. If 3pi/2 - C is larger than sqrt(pi)/2, then x(t) can't reach infinity because the left-hand side can't exceed the right-hand side.

Wait, but maybe not. Let me consider.

Wait, the equation is:

Left-hand side at time t is equal to the integral from 0 to t of e^{-tau^2} dtau. So if as t increases, this integral approaches sqrt(pi)/2. So the left-hand side is also approaching a finite limit. Therefore, unless the left-hand side approaches a limit as x(t) approaches infinity, which is what we just found is 3pi/2 - C, compared to the right-hand side limit of sqrt(pi)/2. Therefore, for the equation to hold in the limit as t goes to infinity, we would require that:

3pi/2 - C = sqrt(pi)/2

But if, for some x(0), this is true, but for other x(0) it might not be. Wait, maybe that line of thought isn't the right way.

Alternatively, if x(t) is going to infinity, then as t approaches some finite time, or t approaching infinity, but in our case, the integral doesn't blow up; the integral up to infinity is finite, so maybe x(t) can't reach infinity in finite time.

Wait, this is crucial. Let me recall that for ordinary differential equations, if the integral of the right-hand side (time component) is finite over an infinite interval, then the solution for x might still be bounded.

But let's think step-by-step.

Suppose x(t) becomes unbounded as t approaches some T, which could be infinity. Let's first check if x(t) could blow up in finite time. Suppose there is a finite T such that lim_{t->T^-} x(t) = infinity. In that case, the left-hand side integral would approach 3pi/2 - C, and the right-hand side integral would approach the integral up to T of e^{-tau^2}, which is finite since T is finite. So unless 3pi/2 - C equals that finite integral, which is unlikely, this isn't possible. Hence, there's a contradiction, meaning x(t) cannot blow up in finite time.

Therefore, the only possibility is x(t) blowing up as t approaches infinity. However, as t approaches infinity, the right-hand side integral approaches sqrt(pi)/2. So for the left-hand side to approach that, which is finite, then x(t) can't go to infinity because the left-hand side would approach 3pi/2 - C, which would only match sqrt(pi)/2 if 3pi/2 - C = sqrt(pi)/2. But unless C is 3pi/2 - sqrt(pi)/2, which is a fixed number, but C depends on x(0). For a general x(0), this equality doesn't hold. Therefore, this would mean that the assumption x(t) approaching infinity leads to a contradiction, because the left-hand side would approach a value that is in general different from sqrt(pi)/2.

Therefore, x(t) can't go to infinity as t approaches infinity.

Therefore, x(t) is bounded above. Similarly, if x(t) tends to -infinity, the left-hand side would approach -3pi/2 - C, but the right-hand side is positive and approaches sqrt(pi)/2. So that would also be a contradiction because a negative number can't equal a positive number. Therefore, x(t) can't go to -infinity either.

Therefore, the solution x(t) must remain bounded for all t >= 0, hence, there exists some M such that |x(t)| < M for all t >= 0.

Alternatively, perhaps this is hand-wavy? Let me check.

Alternatively, we can approach this using the notion of global existence. If we can show that the solution does not blow up in finite time and remains bounded as t approaches infinity, then it exists for all t >= 0 and is bounded. So to check for finite time blow-up, we need to look at the differential equation and see if dx/dt has any terms that would cause x to blow up in finite time.

Looking at the DE:

dx/dt = [2(1 + x^2)^2 / (3(3 + x^2))] e^{-t^2}

The right-hand side, as a function of x and t, has the factor e^{-t^2} which decays rapidly as t increases. The (1 + x^2)^2 / (3 + x^2) term, as x becomes large, behaves like (x^4)/(x^2) = x^2. Therefore, for large x, dx/dt ~ (2/3) x^2 e^{-t^2}

So, near where x is large, the DE looks approximately like dx/dt ≈ (2/3)e^{-t^2} x^2. This is a Riccati-type equation. For such equations, if the coefficient function (here, (2/3)e^{-t^2}) is integrable over [0, infinity), then the solution does not blow up in finite time.

Indeed, let's consider the equation dx/dt = k(t) x^2, where k(t) is integrable over [0, infinity). Then the solution is x(t) = x(0)/(1 - x(0) \int_0^t k(s) ds )

If the integral of k(s) over [0, infinity) is finite, say equal to K, then the denominator approaches 1 - x(0) K. If x(0) K < 1, then the solution remains bounded. Otherwise, if x(0) K >= 1, the denominator could hit zero in finite time, causing x(t) to blow up.

But in our case, comparing with the approximate DE dx/dt ~ (2/3)e^{-t^2} x^2, the coefficient is k(t) = (2/3)e^{-t^2}, and the integral from 0 to infinity of k(t) dt is (2/3) * (sqrt(pi)/2) = sqrt(pi)/3 ≈ 0.590.

Therefore, if the initial condition is such that x(0) < 3/sqrt(pi), then x(t) remains bounded. However, wait, but our original initial condition is x(0) <=1, which is less than 3/sqrt(pi) ≈ 1.692. Therefore, even in this approximate view, if x(0) <=1 < 1.692, then x(t) wouldn't blow up because 1 * sqrt(pi)/3 ≈ 0.590 <1, thus 1 - 0.590 is positive, so the denominator doesn't hit zero.

Wait, but x(0) is in the reciprocal here. Wait, wait. Let me check.

If the approximate equation is dx/dt = k(t) x^2, then the solution is x(t) = x0 / [1 - x0 ∫0^t k(s) ds]

Therefore, if the integral of k(s) up to t is S(t) = ∫0^t k(s) ds, then x(t) = x0 / (1 - x0 S(t))

So if x0 is positive, and S(infty) = sqrt(pi)/3 <1/x0. Since x0 <=1, which implies that 1/x0 >=1, whereas sqrt(pi)/3≈0.59 <1. Therefore, since sqrt(pi)/3 <1<=1/x0 when x0 <=1 (if x0 positive). Wait, if x0 is positive, yes.

But if x0 is negative, then 1 -x0 S(t) would actually become 1 - x0 S(t) = 1 - (negative * positive) =1 + |x0| S(t) which is always positive. So in that case, the denominator never reaches zero, so x(t) approaches 0/(1 - x0 S(t)) as t approaches infinity, perhaps.

But in reality, our actual equation is not exactly dx/dt = k(t) x^2. For large x, it is approximated by that, but the original DE is dx/dt = [2(1 + x^2)^2 / (3(3 + x^2))] e^{-t^2}. Therefore, when x is very large, the DE is approx (2/3)x^2 e^{-t^2}, but for large negative x, since (1 + x^2)^2 is the same as for positive x, so for x negative large, it's similar.

Therefore, even for x large negative, the behavior of dx/dt is similar, but since (dx/dt) is positive when x is large negative, then x would become less negative over time. Wait, actually:

If x is large negative, (1 + x^2)^2 / (3 + x^2) is approx x^4 / x^2 =x^2, so dx/dt ~ (2/3) x^2 e^{-t^2}

But since x is negative, then (1 + x^2)^2 is still positive, and 3 +x^2 is positive. So dx/dt is positive? Wait, yes:

(2/3) * [ (1 + x^2)^2 / (3 + x^2) ] e^{-t^2 } is positive, regardless of the sign of x. Therefore, if x is negative, dx/dt is positive, so x would be increasing towards zero.

If x is positive, dx/dt is also positive, so x increases away from zero.

Therefore, for positive x, the growth is limited by the integrability of k(t) = (2/3)e^{-t^2}, because if x is positive, dx/dt ~ (2/3) x^2 e^{-t^2 }, as we saw. For x(0) <=1, since this k(t) is integrable, then as I thought earlier, the solution remains bounded. If x(0) were greater than 1, might it blow up? Wait, but even for x(0) greater than 1, the integral of k(t) up to infinity is so small (~0.59) that 1 -x0 * K would maybe stay positive. Hmm. But then again, since our problem specifies x(0) <=1, so we can take that into account.

So according to this Riccati equation analogy, with x(t) = x0 / (1 - x0 S(t)), where S(t)= integral k(s) ds. Since S(∞)=sqrt(pi)/3≈0.59 and x0 <=1, then denominator 1 - x0 * S(∞) >=1 -1*0.59 =0.41 >0. Therefore, even if we extrapolate this approximation, x(t) would remain bounded.

Of course, our original equation is not exactly the Riccati equation, but behaves similarly for large x. So if this approximated solution is bounded, then the original equation's solution should be bounded as well.

Therefore, combining the two approaches: the integral equation shows that x(t) is implicitly defined by a relation where the left-hand side is bounded if x(t) is bounded and would approach a finite limit if x(t) tends to infinity. However, that limit would have to equal sqrt(pi)/2, but whether that's possible depends on constants.

But perhaps another way to see is that since the right-hand side is integrable over t from 0 to infinity, then the left-hand side can only accumulate a finite amount of change.

Alternatively, if we think in terms of energy functions or Lyapunov functions... But perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, we can note that the equation is of the form:

dx/dt = f(t)g(x), where f(t) = (2/3) e^{-t^2}, and g(x) = (1 +x^2)^2/(3 + x^2). So the growth of x(t) is controlled by the product of an integrable function f(t) and a function g(x) which, for large |x|, behaves like |x|^2.

But because f(t) is integrable, even if g(x) is quadratic in x when |x| is large, the overall equation can still have a global solution. Here's why: even though g(x) grows quadratically, the factor f(t) is integrable over [0, infinity). Let me recall the comparison theorem.

Suppose we have dx/dt <= f(t)g(x), and we know that integral of f(t) dt is finite, and 1/g(x) is integrable at infinity. Wait, but I might need to think more carefully.

In our case, f(t) is integrable: ∫0^∞ f(t) dt = (2/3)∫0^∞ e^{-t^2} dt = (2/3)(sqrt(pi)/2) = sqrt(pi)/3. And g(x) ≈ x^2 for large x. Therefore, the integral ∫_{x(0)}^{infty} [1/g(x)] dx = ∫_{x(0)}^{infty} (3 +x^2)/(1 + x^2)^2 dx. For large x, integrand ~ 1 / x^2, so integral converges. Therefore, according to the Osgood criterion for global existence? Wait, I might be mixing different criteria.

Another approach: Let's consider the maximal interval of existence. The standard existence and uniqueness theorem says that the solution exists until it blows up. Suppose the solution x(t) has a maximal interval of existence [0, T), where T <= ∞. If T < ∞, then lim sup_{t→T^-} |x(t)| = ∞. But we need to show that T=∞ and |x(t)| doesn’t go to infinity as t→infty.

Suppose T < ∞. Then, near t=T, x(t) blows up. Let's integrate both sides up to T:

Left-hand side: ∫_{x(0)}^{x(t)} [3(3 + x^2)/(2(1 +x^2)^2)] dx approaches ∫_{x(0)}^{±∞} [3(3 +x^2)/(2(1 +x^2)^2)] dx, which, as we saw, is finite (3pi/2 - C or similar). But Right-hand side ∫0^T e^{-tau^2} d tau is finite (less than sqrt(pi)/2). Therefore, again, the left-hand side remains finite as x(t) approaches infinity, which is a contradiction. Therefore, T cannot be finite. Therefore, the solution exists for all t >=0. Moreover, as t approaches infinity, x(t) can't approach infinity because the left integral would approach a finite limit, meaning x(t) must remain bounded.

Alternatively, to make it more precise:

We can write:

If the solution x(t) were to blow up to infinity as t approaches some T (finite or infinite), then by integrating both sides up to T, we would have the left-hand side integral being finite (as established before), which is a contradiction unless T is infinity.

But if T is infinity, then how? If x(t) tends to infinity as t approaches infinity, then the left-hand side integral approaches 3pi/2 - C, which must equal sqrt(pi)/2. But since 3pi/2 is much larger than sqrt(pi)/2 (approximately 4.712 vs 0.886), unless C = 3pi/2 - sqrt(pi)/2 ≈4.712 -0.886≈3.826, but the constant C depends on x(0):

C =3 tan^{-1}x(0) + (3x(0))/(2(1 + x(0)^2)).

If, say, x(0)=1, then:

tan^{-1}(1)=pi/4≈0.785

So C=3*(pi/4)+ (3*1)/(2*(1+1))= (3pi)/4 + 3/4 ≈2.356 +0.75≈3.106

Which is less than 3.826. Hence, 3pi/2 - C≈4.712 -3.106≈1.606, but the right-hand side integral is only ≈0.886. Thus, even at x(0)=1, the left integral can't reach the value of the right integral, since 3pi/2 - C=1.606 > sqrt(pi)/2≈0.886.

Wait, but this is a problem. Wait, perhaps:

Wait, how does the equality hold? At x(t)=infty, left-hand side would equal 3pi/2 -C, which is the value of the LHS if we let x(t) approach infinity. However, the RHS integral approaches sqrt(pi)/2. But unless 3pi/2 -C equals sqrt(pi)/2, otherwise it's impossible. However, C is determined by the initial condition, as above. So 3pi/2 - sqrt(pi)/2 must equal C for x(t) to approach infinity. But since in reality C is fixed by x(0), unless x(0) is chosen precisely such that C=3pi/2 -sqrt(pi)/2≈4.712−0.886≈3.826, but our x(0) <=1, and C with x(0)=1 is≈3.106, so even less.

Therefore, if we tried to set x(t) approaches infinity, then we would need:

Left side→3pi/2 -C ≈1.606=Right side→sqrt(pi)/2≈0.886

Therefore, 1.606 cannot be equal to 0.886. Therefore, such equality never holds, meaning x(t) cannot reach infinity.

Therefore, the solution remains bounded.

Therefore, putting it all together:

1. The equation is separable, leading to integrals that converge as t approaches infinity.

2. For x(t) to blow up, the left integral must reach a value exceeding what the right integral allows, leading to a contradiction.

3. Therefore, x(t) remains bounded for all t >=0.

Thus, such M exists.

<skill>Mathematical Transformation</skill>
<definition>The ability to convert mathematical expressions from one form to another equivalent form that is more amenable to analysis or computation.</definition>

<start>566</start>
<end>709</end>
<text>\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{2(1 + x^2)^2}{3(3 + x^2)} e^{-t^2} \]

Yes, so we can write this as:

\[ \frac{3(3 + x^2)}{2(1 + x^2)^2} dx = e^{-t^2} dt \]</text>
<explanation>The solver transforms the differential equation by separating variables, which is a key technique for solving such equations. This transformation prepares the equation for integration.</explanation>

<start>1550</start>
<end>1859</end>
<text>Let me split this into two terms:

\[ \frac{3 + x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} = \frac{3}{(1 + x^2)^2} + \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} \]

Then:

\[ \frac{3}{(1 + x^2)^2} + \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} = \frac{3}{(1 + x^2)^2} + \frac{(1 + x^2) - 1}{(1 + x^2)^2} \]</text>
<explanation>The solver breaks down a complex rational expression into simpler components, demonstrating their ability to transform mathematical expressions to make them more manageable for integration.</explanation>

<start>1859</start>
<end>2139</end>
<text>Wait, hold on:

\(x^2 = (1 + x^2) - 1\), so substituting that in:

\[ \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} = \frac{(1 + x^2) - 1}{(1 + x^2)^2} = \frac{1}{1 + x^2} - \frac{1}{(1 + x^2)^2} \]

Therefore, substituting back:

\[ \frac{3 + x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} = \frac{3}{(1 + x^2)^2} + \frac{1}{1 + x^2} - \frac{1}{(1 + x^2)^2} \]</text>
<explanation>The solver applies algebraic manipulation to transform a complex fraction into a sum of simpler fractions, using the identity x² = (1+x²)-1. This transformation is crucial for being able to integrate the expression.</explanation>

<skill>Integration Techniques</skill>
<definition>The ability to apply various methods and formulas to compute integrals, including recognizing standard forms, using substitution, and applying integration by parts.</definition>

<start>2796</start>
<end>3198</end>
<text>Integration of \(\frac{1}{(1 + x^2)^2} dx\). Using the substitution \(x = \tan \theta\), then \(dx = \sec^2 \theta d\theta\), and the integral becomes:

\[ \int \frac{\sec^2 \theta}{(1 + \tan^2 \theta)^2} d\theta = \int \frac{\sec^2 \theta}{(\sec^2 \theta)^2} d\theta = \int \cos^2 \theta d\theta = \frac{1}{2} (\theta + \sin \theta \cos \theta) + C \]</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates advanced integration techniques by using trigonometric substitution to evaluate a complex integral. They recognize that x = tan θ is an appropriate substitution for expressions involving 1+x² and correctly apply the necessary transformations.</explanation>

<start>3198</start>
<end>3487</end>
<text>Then substituting back:

\(\theta = \tan^{-1} x\), so \(\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\), \(\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\). Therefore,

\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \tan^{-1} x + \frac{x}{1 + x^2} \right) + C \]</text>
<explanation>The solver correctly back-substitutes to express the result in terms of the original variable x, showing mastery of the complete integration process including handling the substitution in both directions.</explanation>

<skill>Limit Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to determine the behavior of mathematical expressions as variables approach specific values or infinity, often using algebraic manipulations and known limit properties.</definition>

<start>5694</start>
<end>5930</end>
<text>Compute the limit as \( x \to \infty \):

First, \( \tan^{-1} x \) approaches \( \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Second, \( \frac{x}{1 + x^2} \) behaves like \( \frac{1}{x} \), which approaches 0.

Therefore, \( 3 \tan^{-1}x + \frac{3x}{2(1 + x^2)} \) approaches \( 3 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} + 0 = \frac{3\pi}{2} \).</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes the limiting behavior of the expression as x approaches infinity. They correctly identify the limits of each component and combine them to determine the overall limit, which is crucial for understanding the boundedness of the solution.</explanation>

<start>5930</start>
<end>6080</end>
<text>Similarly, if \( x \to -\infty \), then \( \tan^{-1}x \to -\frac{\pi}{2} \), and \( \frac{x}{1 + x^2} \to 0 \) as well.

So for \( x \to -\infty \), the limit is \( -\frac{3\pi}{2} + 0 = -\frac{3\pi}{2} \).</text>
<explanation>The solver extends the limit analysis to the case where x approaches negative infinity, showing thorough consideration of all possible scenarios for the solution's behavior.</explanation>

<skill>Contradiction-Based Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to prove a statement by assuming its negation and deriving a logical contradiction, thereby establishing the original statement must be true.</definition>

<start>6080</start>
<end>6534</end>
<text>But the integral from the right-hand side is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \).

Given that the equation equals the right-hand side, which is positive and bounded, but let me think again about the left-hand side when \( x \) is large.

Suppose \( x(t) \) becomes very large, then the left-hand side approaches either \( \frac{3\pi}{2} - C \) or \( -\frac{3\pi}{2} - C \), where \( C = 3 \tan^{-1}x(0) + \frac{3x(0)}{2(1 + x(0)^2)} \).</text>
<explanation>The solver begins setting up a contradiction by assuming x(t) becomes very large and examining the consequences for the equation. This is the initial step in a proof by contradiction where they will show that the assumption leads to an impossibility.</explanation>

<start>9553</start>
<end>10093</end>
<text>Therefore, for the left-hand side to approach that, which is finite, then x(t) can't go to infinity because the left-hand side would approach 3pi/2 - C, which would only match sqrt(pi)/2 if 3pi/2 - C = sqrt(pi)/2. But unless C is 3pi/2 - sqrt(pi)/2, which is a fixed number, but C depends on x(0). For a general x(0), this equality doesn't hold. Therefore, this would mean that the assumption x(t) approaching infinity leads to a contradiction, because the left-hand side would approach a value that is in general different from sqrt(pi)/2.

Therefore, x(t) can't go to infinity as t approaches infinity.</text>
<explanation>The solver completes the contradiction argument by showing that if x(t) were to approach infinity, the left side of the equation would approach a value that cannot match the right side. This contradiction proves that the original assumption (that x(t) becomes unbounded) must be false.</explanation>

<start>10093</start>
<end>10428</end>
<text>Therefore, x(t) is bounded above. Similarly, if x(t) tends to -infinity, the left-hand side would approach -3pi/2 - C, but the right-hand side is positive and approaches sqrt(pi)/2. So that would also be a contradiction because a negative number can't equal a positive number. Therefore, x(t) can't go to -infinity either.

Therefore, the solution x(t) must remain bounded for all t >= 0, hence, there exists some M such that |x(t)| < M for all t >= 0.</text>
<explanation>The solver extends the contradiction argument to the case where x(t) approaches negative infinity, showing that this also leads to a contradiction. This completes the proof that the solution must be bounded in both directions, establishing the existence of M as required.</explanation>

<skill>Asymptotic Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to analyze and characterize the behavior of functions or solutions as variables approach extreme values, often using approximations that capture the dominant terms.</definition>

<start>11007</start>
<end>11385</end>
<text>Looking at the DE:

dx/dt = [2(1 + x^2)^2 / (3(3 + x^2))] e^{-t^2}

The right-hand side, as a function of x and t, has the factor e^{-t^2} which decays rapidly as t increases. The (1 + x^2)^2 / (3 + x^2) term, as x becomes large, behaves like (x^4)/(x^2) = x^2. Therefore, for large x, dx/dt ~ (2/3) x^2 e^{-t^2}</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes the asymptotic behavior of the differential equation for large values of x, identifying how the rational function term behaves in this limit. This asymptotic analysis helps understand how the solution might grow as x becomes large.</explanation>

<start>11385</start>
<end>11720</end>
<text>So, near where x is large, the DE looks approximately like dx/dt ≈ (2/3)e^{-t^2} x^2. This is a Riccati-type equation. For such equations, if the coefficient function (here, (2/3)e^{-t^2}) is integrable over [0, infinity), then the solution does not blow up in finite time.

Indeed, let's consider the equation dx/dt = k(t) x^2, where k(t) is integrable over [0, infinity). Then the solution is x(t) = x(0)/(1 - x(0) \int_0^t k(s) ds )</text>
<explanation>The solver approximates the original equation with a simpler form that captures the essential behavior for large x. They identify this as a Riccati-type equation and use known properties of such equations to analyze the solution's behavior.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Modeling</skill>
<definition>The ability to represent real-world or abstract problems using mathematical structures, and to make simplifications or approximations that preserve essential features while making the problem tractable.</definition>

<start>11720</start>
<end>12215</end>
<text>If the integral of k(s) over [0, infinity) is finite, say equal to K, then the denominator approaches 1 - x(0) K. If x(0) K < 1, then the solution remains bounded. Otherwise, if x(0) K >= 1, the denominator could hit zero in finite time, causing x(t) to blow up.

But in our case, comparing with the approximate DE dx/dt ~ (2/3)e^{-t^2} x^2, the coefficient is k(t) = (2/3)e^{-t^2}, and the integral from 0 to infinity of k(t) dt is (2/3) * (sqrt(pi)/2) = sqrt(pi)/3 ≈ 0.590.

Therefore, if the initial condition is such that x(0) < 3/sqrt(pi), then x(t) remains bounded. However, wait, but our original initial condition is x(0) <=1, which is less than 3/sqrt(pi) ≈ 1.692.</text>
<explanation>The solver creates a simplified mathematical model of the original problem by approximating the differential equation for large x values. They then analyze this model to draw conclusions about the boundedness of solutions, showing how the initial condition x(0)≤1 ensures boundedness in their approximate model.</explanation>

<skill>Multiple Solution Strategies</skill>
<definition>The ability to approach a problem from different angles, using various mathematical techniques to verify or strengthen the conclusion.</definition>

<start>12428</start>
<end>12650</end>
<text>Alternatively, we can approach this using the notion of global existence. If we can show that the solution does not blow up in finite time and remains bounded as t approaches infinity, then it exists for all t >= 0 and is bounded.</text>
<explanation>The solver introduces an alternative approach based on the concept of global existence, demonstrating their ability to tackle the problem from multiple perspectives.</explanation>

<start>14048</start>
<end>14332</end>
<text>Another approach: Let's consider the maximal interval of existence. The standard existence and uniqueness theorem says that the solution exists until it blows up. Suppose the solution x(t) has a maximal interval of existence [0, T), where T <= ∞. If T < ∞, then lim sup_{t→T^-} |x(t)| = ∞. But we need to show that T=∞ and |x(t)| doesn't go to infinity as t→infty.</text>
<explanation>The solver introduces yet another approach based on the maximal interval of existence, showing their ability to use multiple mathematical frameworks to analyze the problem.</explanation>

<start>16518</start>
<end>16897</end>
<text>Therefore, putting it all together:

1. The equation is separable, leading to integrals that converge as t approaches infinity.

2. For x(t) to blow up, the left integral must reach a value exceeding what the right integral allows, leading to a contradiction.

3. Therefore, x(t) remains bounded for all t >=
