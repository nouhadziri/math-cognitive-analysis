Problem:
For a continuous and absolutely integrable complex-valued function $f(x)$ on $\mathbb{R}$, define a function $(S f)(x)$ on $\mathbb{R}$ by $(S f)(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{2 \pi \mathrm{i} u x} f(u) \mathrm{d} u$. Find explicit forms of $S\left(\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}\right)$ and $S\left(\frac{1}{\left(1+x^{2}\right)^{2}}\right)$.

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Write $f(x)=\left(1+x^{2}\right)^{-1}$. For $x \geq 0$, we have $(S f)(x)=\lim _{A \rightarrow+\infty} \int_{-A}^{A} \frac{e^{2 \pi \mathrm{i} u x}}{1+u^{2}} \mathrm{~d} u$. Put $C_{A}:=\{z=u+\mathbf{i} v:-A \leq u \leq A, v=0\} \bigcup\left\{z=A e^{\mathbf{i} \theta}: 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi\right\}$. Note that, $\mathbf{i}$ is the only pole of $\frac{1}{1+z^{2}}$ inside the domain bounded by $C_{A}$ whenever $A>1$. Using the trick of contour integral and letting $A \rightarrow \infty$, we get $(S f)(x)=\pi e^{-2 \pi x}$. Since $f(x)$ is an even function, so is $(S f)(x)$. Then, $(S f)(x)=\pi e^{-2 \pi|x|}$. Write $g(x)=\pi e^{-2 \pi|x|}$. By direct calculation $(S g)(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{2 \pi \mathrm{i} x u} \pi e^{-2 \pi|u|} \mathrm{d} u=\pi \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(e^{2 \pi \mathbf{i} x u}+e^{-2 \pi \mathbf{i} x u}\right) e^{-2 \pi u} \mathrm{~d} u=-\left.\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{e^{-2 \pi(1+\mathbf{i} x) u}}{1+\mathbf{i} x}+\frac{e^{-2 \pi(1-\mathbf{i} x) u}}{1-\mathbf{i} x}\right)\right|_{0} ^{\infty}=\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}.

<text>Put $C_{A}:=\{z=u+\mathbf{i} v:-A \leq u \leq A, v=0\} \bigcup\left\{z=A e^{\mathbf{i} \theta}: 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi\right\}$. Note that, $\mathbf{i}$ is the only pole of $\frac{1}{1+z^{2}}$ inside the domain bounded by $C_{A}$ whenever $A>1$. Using the trick of contour integral and letting $A \rightarrow \infty$, we get $(S f)(x)=\pi e^{-2 \pi x}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies complex analysis by defining a contour in the complex plane, identifying the pole at i, and using contour integration techniques to evaluate the improper integral. This demonstrates advanced knowledge of complex analysis and its application to transform a real integral into a more manageable contour integral in the complex plane.</explanation>

<skill>Function Property Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and leverage important properties of functions (such as symmetry, parity, or periodicity) to simplify problem-solving.</definition>

<start>303</start>
<end>373</end>
<text>Since $f(x)$ is an even function, so is $(S f)(x)$. Then, $(S f)(x)=\pi e^{-2 \pi|x|}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that f(x) = 1/(1+x²) is an even function, and uses this property to extend the result from x ≥ 0 to all real x by introducing the absolute value in the exponent. This demonstrates the ability to recognize and apply function symmetry properties to generalize results.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver strategically defines a new function g(x) based on the result of the first part of the problem. This substitution sets up the approach for finding the second required transform by effectively using the first result, demonstrating the ability to build on previous results through strategic function definition.</explanation>

<skill>Integral Transformation</skill>
<definition>The ability to transform complex integrals into more manageable forms by changing variables, splitting domains, or rewriting expressions.</definition>

<explanation>The solver transforms the integral by splitting the domain at u=0 and using the properties of the absolute value function. This allows them to rewrite the integral over the entire real line as an integral over the positive reals with a modified integrand, demonstrating the ability to strategically transform integrals to more tractable forms.</explanation>

This involves complex algebraic manipulations and simplification to arrive at the final result, demonstrating computational fluency with complex expressions.</explanation>

<skill>Inverse Transform Recognition</skill>

By direct calculation $(S g)(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{2 \pi \mathrm{i} x u} \pi e^{-2 \pi|u|} \mathrm{d} u=\pi \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(e^{2 \pi \mathbf{i} x u}+e^{-2 \pi \mathbf{i} x u}\right) e^{-2 \pi u} \mathrm{~d} u=-\left.\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{e^{-2 \pi(1+\mathbf{i} x) u}}{1+\mathbf{i} x}+\frac{e^{-2 \pi(1-\mathbf{i} x) u}}{1-\mathbf{i} x}\right)\right|_{0} ^{\infty}=\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that by calculating S(g(x)), they are effectively finding the inverse transform of the result from the first part. This shows they understand the relationship between forward and inverse transforms, and leverage this insight to find S(1/(1+x²)²) by working with the transform pairs.</explanation>
