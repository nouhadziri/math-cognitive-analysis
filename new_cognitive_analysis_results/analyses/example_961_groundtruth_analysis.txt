Problem:
A sequence  $(a_n)$  is defined recursively by  $a_1=0, a_2=1$  and for  $n\ge 3$ ,
\[a_n=\frac12na_{n-1}+\frac12n(n-1)a_{n-2}+(-1)^n\left(1-\frac{n}{2}\right).\]
Find a closed-form expression for  $f_n=a_n+2\binom{n}{1}a_{n-1}+3\binom{n}{2}a_{n-2}+\ldots +(n-1)\binom{n}{n-2}a_2+n\binom{n}{n-1}a_1$ .

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Define the sequence and transform it:**

   Given the sequence \( (a_n) \) defined recursively by:
   \[
   a_1 = 0, \quad a_2 = 1, \quad \text{and for } n \geq 3,
   \]
   \[
   a_n = \frac{1}{2} n a_{n-1} + \frac{1}{2} n (n-1) a_{n-2} + (-1)^n \left(1 - \frac{n}{2}\right).
   \]

   We introduce \( b_n = \frac{a_n}{n!} \). Then:
   \[
   b_1 = 0, \quad b_2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad b_3 = \frac{1}{6},
   \]
   and for \( n \geq 3 \),
   \[
   b_n = \frac{1}{2} \left( b_{n-1} + b_{n-2} \right) + (-1)^n \cdot \frac{1 - \frac{n}{2}}{n!}.
   \]

2. **Define the transformed sequence \( g_n \):**

   Let:
   \[
   g_n = \frac{1}{n!} f_n = \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{k=1}^n (n-k+1) \binom{n}{n-k} a_k = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{n-k+1}{(n-k)!} b_k.
   \]

3. **Calculate the difference \( g_{n+1} - g_n \):**

   \[
   g_{n+1} - g_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \frac{n-k+2}{(n+1-k)!} b_k - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{n-k+1}{(n-k)!} b_k.
   \]

   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   g_{n+1} - g_n = \sum_{k=2}^{n+1} \frac{n-k+2}{(n+1-k)!} b_k - \sum_{k=2}^{n+1} \frac{n-k+2}{(n-k+1)!} b_{k-1}.
   \]

   This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   g_{n+1} - g_n = \sum_{k=2}^{n+1} \frac{n-k+2}{(n+1-k)!} (b_k - b_{k-1}).
   \]

4. **Introduce the sequence \( d_n \):**

   Let \( d_n = (-2)^n (b_n - b_{n-1}) \). Then:
   \[
   d_n = d_{n-1} + \left( 1 - \frac{n}{2} \right) \cdot \frac{2^n}{n!}.
   \]

   Given \( d_2 = 2 \), we have:
   \[
   d_n = 2 + \sum_{i=3}^n \left( 1 - \frac{i}{2} \right) \cdot \frac{2^i}{i!} = \frac{2^n}{n!}.
   \]

   Thus:
   \[
   b_n - b_{n-1} = \frac{d_n}{(-2)^n} = \frac{2^n}{(-2)^n \cdot n!} = \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}.
   \]

5. **Simplify \( g_{n+1} - g_n \):**

   \[
   g_{n+1} - g_n = \sum_{k=2}^{n+1} \frac{n+2-k}{(n+1-k)!} \cdot \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}.
   \]

   This can be split into two sums:
   \[
   g_{n+1} - g_n = \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{(-1)^k}{(n-k)! k!} + \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \frac{(-1)^k}{(n+1-k)! k!}.
   \]

   Using the binomial theorem, we know:
   \[
   \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \binom{n}{k} = 0, \quad \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} (-1)^k \binom{n+1}{k} = 0.
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   g_{n+1} - g_n = -\frac{1}{n!} (1 - n) - \frac{1}{(n+1)!} (1 - (n+1)) = \frac{1}{(n-1)!} - \frac{1}{(n+1)!}.
   \]

6. **Calculate \( g_3 \):**

   \[
   g_3 = 2b_2 + b_3 = \frac{4}{3}.
   \]

7. **Find the closed-form expression for \( f_n \):**

   \[
   f_n = n! g_n = n! \left( \sum_{k=4}^n \frac{1}{(k-2)!} - \sum_{k=4}^n \frac{1}{k!} + g_3 \right).
   \]

   Simplifying further:
   \[
   f_n = n! \left( g_3 + \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} - \frac{n+1}{n!} \right) = 2 \cdot n! - (n+1).
   \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{2n! - n - 1}\).

   \[
   b_1 = 0, \quad b_2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad b_3 = \frac{1}{6},
   \]
   and for \( n \geq 3 \),
   \[
   b_n = \frac{1}{2} \left( b_{n-1} + b_{n-2} \right) + (-1)^n \cdot \frac{1 - \frac{n}{2}}{n!}.
   \]</text>

<start>622</start>
<end>726</end>
<text>Let \( d_n = (-2)^n (b_n - b_{n-1}) \). Then:
   \[
   d_n = d_{n-1} + \left( 1 - \frac{n}{2} \right) \cdot \frac{2^n}{n!}.

<explanation>The solver introduces yet another transformation d_n to represent the difference between consecutive terms of the b_n sequence, multiplied by a factor. This shows a sophisticated understanding of how to isolate and analyze patterns in differences between sequence terms.</explanation>

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify regularities, structures, or rules in mathematical expressions or sequences, allowing for generalization and prediction of future terms.</definition>

<start>726</start>
<end>865</end>
<text>Given \( d_2 = 2 \), we have:
   \[
   d_n = 2 + \sum_{i=3}^n \left( 1 - \frac{i}{2} \right) \cdot \frac{2^i}{i!} = \frac{2^n}{n!}.
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes a pattern in the d_n sequence, allowing them to express it in closed form as 2^n/n!. This demonstrates the ability to detect patterns in complex expressions and simplify them to more manageable forms.</explanation>

<start>865</start>
<end>960</end>
<text>Thus:
   \[
   b_n - b_{n-1} = \frac{d_n}{(-2)^n} = \frac{2^n}{(-2)^n \cdot n!} = \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}.
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies that the difference between consecutive terms of b_n follows a simple pattern of (-1)^n/n!, showing the ability to recognize elegant patterns that emerge from complex manipulations.</explanation>

<skill>Telescoping Series Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify when a series can be rewritten as a sum of differences where most terms cancel out, leaving only the first and last terms (or a small number of terms).</definition>

<start>1109</start>

<text>Using the binomial theorem, we know:
   \[
   \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \binom{n}{k} = 0, \quad \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} (-1)^k \binom{n+1}{k} = 0.
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   g_{n+1} - g_n = -\frac{1}{n!} (1 - n) - \frac{1}{(n+1)!} (1 - (n+1)) = \frac{1}{(n-1)!} - \frac{1}{(n+1)!}.
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that the expression for g_{n+1} - g_n can be simplified to a difference of two terms, which is characteristic of telescoping series. This recognition allows them to find a much simpler expression for the difference between consecutive terms of g_n.</explanation>

<start>1396</start>

<text>\[
   f_n = n! g_n = n! \left( \sum_{k=4}^n \frac{1}{(k-2)!} - \sum_{k=4}^n \frac{1}{k!} + g_3 \right).
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that g_n can be expressed as a telescoping sum where most terms cancel out, leaving only a few boundary terms. This recognition is crucial for finding the closed-form expression for f_n.</explanation>

   \]

   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   g_{n+1} - g_n = \sum_{k=2}^{n+1} \frac{n-k+2}{(n+1-k)!} b_k - \sum_{k=2}^{n+1} \frac{n-k+2}{(n-k+1)!} b_{k-1}.
   \]

   This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   g_{n+1} - g_n = \sum_{k=2}^{n+1} \frac{n-k+2}{(n+1-k)!} (b_k - b_{k-1}).
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes the recursive relationship between consecutive terms of g_n by computing g_{n+1} - g_n and simplifying the expression. This shows a sophisticated understanding of how to manipulate recursive definitions to extract useful patterns.</explanation>

<start>964</start>
<end>1109</end>
<text>Simplify \( g_{n+1} - g_n \):**

   \[
   g_{n+1} - g_n = \sum_{k=2}^{n+1} \frac{n+2-k}{(n+1-k)!} \cdot \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}.
   \]

   This can be split into two sums:

   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver continues analyzing the recursive relationship by substituting the pattern found for b_k - b_{k-1} into the expression for g_{n+1} - g_n. This shows methodical analysis of recursive structures to derive simpler forms.</explanation>

<text>1. **Define the sequence and transform it:**</text>
<explanation>The solver begins by clearly identifying the first step in their solution strategy: transforming the original sequence. This shows a deliberate approach to decomposing the problem into manageable steps.</explanation>

<start>184</start>
<end>185</end>
