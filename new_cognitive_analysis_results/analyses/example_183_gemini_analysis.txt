Consider a contingent claim that pays $S(1)^\alpha$ at time 1. What is the time-0 price of the contigent claim?

Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the time-0 price of a contingent claim that pays $S(1)^\alpha$ at time 1, within the Black-Scholes framework. We are given the dynamics of the stock price and some information about the expectation of a power of the stock price at time 1.

The stock price process is given by $\frac{dS(t)}{S(t)} = \mu dt + \sigma dZ(t)$, where $\mu = 0.05$ and $\sigma = 0.2$. This means $S(t)$ follows a geometric Brownian motion. The solution to this SDE is $S(t) = S(0) \exp((\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)t + \sigma Z(t))$.

Given $S(0) = 0.5$, $\mu = 0.05$, $\sigma = 0.2$, we have:
$S(t) = 0.5 \exp((0.05 - \frac{1}{2}(0.2)^2)t + 0.2 Z(t))$
$S(t) = 0.5 \exp((0.05 - 0.02)t + 0.2 Z(t))$
$S(t) = 0.5 \exp(0.03t + 0.2 Z(t))$

At time $t=1$, we have:
$S(1) = 0.5 \exp(0.03 + 0.2 Z(1))$

We are given $E[S(1)^\alpha] = 1.4$. Let's use the expression for $S(1)$:
$S(1)^\alpha = (0.5 \exp(0.03 + 0.2 Z(1)))^\alpha = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(\alpha(0.03 + 0.2 Z(1)))$
$S(1)^\alpha = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha + 0.2\alpha Z(1))$

Now, let's find the expectation of $S(1)^\alpha$:
$E[S(1)^\alpha] = E[(0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha + 0.2\alpha Z(1))]$
$E[S(1)^\alpha] = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha) E[\exp(0.2\alpha Z(1))]$

We know that $Z(1) \sim N(0, 1)$. If $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, then $E[e^{aX}] = e^{a\mu + \frac{1}{2}a^2\sigma^2}$.
In our case, $Z(1) \sim N(0, 1)$, and we are interested in $E[\exp(0.2\alpha Z(1))]$. Here, $a = 0.2\alpha$, $\mu = 0$, $\sigma^2 = 1$.
$E[\exp(0.2\alpha Z(1))] = \exp(0.2\alpha \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{2}(0.2\alpha)^2 \cdot 1) = \exp(\frac{1}{2}(0.04\alpha^2)) = \exp(0.02\alpha^2)$

Substituting this back into the expression for $E[S(1)^\alpha]$:
$E[S(1)^\alpha] = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha) \exp(0.02\alpha^2)$
$E[S(1)^\alpha] = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2)$

We are given $E[S(1)^\alpha] = 1.4$. So,
$1.4 = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2)$

Now, let's consider the pricing of the contingent claim. The payoff at time 1 is $H = S(1)^\alpha$. The time-0 price of this claim is given by the discounted expected payoff under the risk-neutral measure:
Price at time 0 = $e^{-r \cdot 1} E^*[S(1)^\alpha]$
where $r = 0.03$ is the risk-free interest rate, and $E^*$ denotes the expectation under the risk-neutral measure.

Under the risk-neutral measure, the stock price process follows:
$\frac{dS(t)}{S(t)} = r dt + \sigma dW(t)$
where $W(t)$ is a standard Brownian motion under the risk-neutral measure.
So, $S(t) = S(0) \exp((r - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)t + \sigma W(t))$.

At time $t=1$, under the risk-neutral measure:
$S(1) = 0.5 \exp((0.03 - \frac{1}{2}(0.2)^2) \cdot 1 + 0.2 W(1))$
$S(1) = 0.5 \exp((0.03 - 0.02) + 0.2 W(1))$
$S(1) = 0.5 \exp(0.01 + 0.2 W(1))$

We need to find $E^*[S(1)^\alpha]$:
$S(1)^\alpha = (0.5 \exp(0.01 + 0.2 W(1)))^\alpha = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(\alpha(0.01 + 0.2 W(1)))$
$S(1)^\alpha = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.01\alpha + 0.2\alpha W(1))$

$E^*[S(1)^\alpha] = E^*[(0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.01\alpha + 0.2\alpha W(1))]$
$E^*[S(1)^\alpha] = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.01\alpha) E^*[\exp(0.2\alpha W(1))]$

Under the risk-neutral measure, $W(1) \sim N(0, 1)$.
$E^*[\exp(0.2\alpha W(1))] = \exp(0.2\alpha \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{2}(0.2\alpha)^2 \cdot 1) = \exp(0.02\alpha^2)$

So, $E^*[S(1)^\alpha] = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.01\alpha) \exp(0.02\alpha^2) = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.01\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2)$.

The time-0 price of the contingent claim is:
Price at time 0 = $e^{-0.03 \cdot 1} E^*[S(1)^\alpha]$
Price at time 0 = $e^{-0.03} (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.01\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2)$

We need to find the value of $\alpha$ from the given information $E[S(1)^\alpha] = 1.4$.
$1.4 = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2)$

Let's try to relate the expression for the price to the given information.
Consider the ratio $\frac{E^*[S(1)^\alpha]}{E[S(1)^\alpha]}$:
$\frac{E^*[S(1)^\alpha]}{E[S(1)^\alpha]} = \frac{(0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.01\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2)}{(0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2)} = \frac{\exp(0.01\alpha)}{\exp(0.03\alpha)} = \exp(0.01\alpha - 0.03\alpha) = \exp(-0.02\alpha)$

So, $E^*[S(1)^\alpha] = E[S(1)^\alpha] \exp(-0.02\alpha) = 1.4 \exp(-0.02\alpha)$.

The time-0 price is $e^{-0.03} E^*[S(1)^\alpha] = e^{-0.03} \cdot 1.4 \exp(-0.02\alpha) = 1.4 \exp(-0.03 - 0.02\alpha)$.

We still need to find $\alpha$. We have the equation:
$1.4 = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2)$

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:
$\ln(1.4) = \ln((0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2))$
$\ln(1.4) = \ln((0.5)^\alpha) + \ln(\exp(0.03\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2))$
$\ln(1.4) = \alpha \ln(0.5) + 0.03\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2$
$\ln(1.4) = \alpha (-\ln(2)) + 0.03\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2$
$\ln(1.4) = \alpha (-0.6931) + 0.03\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2$
$\ln(1.4) = -0.6631\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2$

$0.02\alpha^2 - 0.6631\alpha - \ln(1.4) = 0$
$\ln(1.4) \approx 0.3365$

$0.02\alpha^2 - 0.6631\alpha - 0.3365 = 0$

We can solve this quadratic equation for $\alpha$:
$\alpha = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
where $a = 0.02$, $b = -0.6631$, $c = -0.3365$.

$b^2 = (-0.6631)^2 = 0.43970161$
$4ac = 4(0.02)(-0.3365) = 0.08(-0.3365) = -0.02692$

$b^2 - 4ac = 0.43970161 - (-0.02692) = 0.43970161 + 0.02692 = 0.46662161$
$\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} = \sqrt{0.46662161} \approx 0.683096$

$\alpha = \frac{0.6631 \pm 0.683096}{0.04}$

Two possible values for $\alpha$:
$\alpha_1 = \frac{0.6631 + 0.683096}{0.04} = \frac{1.346196}{0.04} = 33.6549$
$\alpha_2 = \frac{0.6631 - 0.683096}{0.04} = \frac{-0.019996}{0.04} = -0.4999$

We are given that $\alpha$ is a negative constant, so $\alpha \approx -0.5$.

Now, let's plug this value of $\alpha$ into the expression for the price:
Price at time 0 = $1.4 \exp(-0.03 - 0.02\alpha)$
Price at time 0 = $1.4 \exp(-0.03 - 0.02(-0.5))$
Price at time 0 = $1.4 \exp(-0.03 + 0.01)$
Price at time 0 = $1.4 \exp(-0.02)$
Price at time 0 = $1.4 \times 0.9802$
Price at time 0 $\approx 1.37228$

Let's double-check the calculations.

Alternative approach: Use Girsanov's theorem.
The Radon-Nikodym derivative for changing from the real-world measure $P$ to the risk-neutral measure $Q$ is given by:
$\frac{dQ}{dP}\Big|_1 = \exp\left(-\theta Z(1) - \frac{1}{2}\theta^2\right)$
where $\theta = \frac{r - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{0.03 - 0.05}{0.2} = \frac{-0.02}{0.2} = -0.1$.

$\frac{dQ}{dP}\Big|_1 = \exp\left(-(-0.1) Z(1) - \frac{1}{2}(-0.1)^2\right) = \exp\left(0.1 Z(1) - 0.005\right)$

The price of the contingent claim is $e^{-r} E[S(1)^\alpha \frac{dQ}{dP}\Big|_1]$.
Price at time 0 = $e^{-0.03} E[S(1)^\alpha \exp(0.1 Z(1) - 0.005)]$

Substitute the expression for $S(1)^\alpha$:
$S(1)^\alpha = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha + 0.2\alpha Z(1))$

Price at time 0 = $e^{-0.03} E[(0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha + 0.2\alpha Z(1)) \exp(0.1 Z(1) - 0.005)]$
Price at time 0 = $e^{-0.03} (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha - 0.005) E[\exp(0.2\alpha Z(1) + 0.1 Z(1))]$
Price at time 0 = $e^{-0.03} (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha - 0.005) E[\exp((0.2\alpha + 0.1) Z(1))]$

Let $k = 0.2\alpha + 0.1$.
$E[\exp(k Z(1))] = \exp(\frac{1}{2}k^2)$ since $Z(1) \sim N(0, 1)$.
$E[\exp((0.2\alpha + 0.1) Z(1))] = \exp(\frac{1}{2}(0.2\alpha + 0.1)^2)$
$= \exp(\frac{1}{2}(0.04\alpha^2 + 0.04\alpha + 0.01))$
$= \exp(0.02\alpha^2 + 0.02\alpha + 0.005)$

Price at time 0 = $e^{-0.03} (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha - 0.005) \exp(0.02\alpha^2 + 0.02\alpha + 0.005)$
Price at time 0 = $e^{-0.03} (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha - 0.005 + 0.02\alpha^2 + 0.02\alpha + 0.005)$
Price at time 0 = $e^{-0.03} (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.02\alpha^2 + 0.05\alpha)$

Now, let's use the information $1.4 = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2)$.
$(0.5)^\alpha = 1.4 \exp(-(0.03\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2))$

Substitute this into the price expression:
Price at time 0 = $e^{-0.03} (1.4 \exp(-(0.03\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2))) \exp(0.02\alpha^2 + 0.05\alpha)$
Price at time 0 = $1.4 e^{-0.03} \exp(-0.03\alpha - 0.02\alpha^2 + 0.02\alpha^2 + 0.05\alpha)$
Price at time 0 = $1.4 e^{-0.03} \exp(0.02\alpha)$
Price at time 0 = $1.4 \exp(-0.03 + 0.02\alpha)$

This does not match the previous result. Let's find the mistake.

The price of the claim is $e^{-rT} E^*[Payoff]$, where $E^*$ is under the risk-neutral measure.
The payoff is $S(1)^\alpha$.
Price = $e^{-0.03} E^*[S(1)^\alpha]$
We found $E^*[S(1)^\alpha] = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.01\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2)$.
Price = $e^{-0.03} (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.01\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2)$.

From $1.4 = (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2)$, we have $(0.5)^\alpha = 1.4 \exp(-0.03\alpha - 0.02\alpha^2)$.

Substitute this back:
Price = $e^{-0.03} (1.4 \exp(-0.03\alpha - 0.02\alpha^2)) \exp(0.01\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2)$
Price = $1.4 e^{-0.03} \exp(-0.03\alpha - 0.02\alpha^2 + 0.01\alpha + 0.02\alpha^2)$
Price = $1.4 e^{-0.03} \exp(-0.02\alpha)$
Price = $1.4 \exp(-0.03 - 0.02\alpha)$

This matches the previous result. The mistake was in the calculation using Girsanov's theorem.

Let's recheck the Girsanov approach.
Price = $e^{-r} E[H \frac{dQ}{dP}]$
$H = S(1)^\alpha$
$\frac{dQ}{dP}\Big|_1 = \exp(-\theta Z(1) - \frac{1}{2}\theta^2)$

Price = $e^{-r} E[S(1)^\alpha \exp(-\theta Z(1) - \frac{1}{2}\theta^2)]$
Price = $e^{-r} E[(0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha + 0.2\alpha Z(1)) \exp(-\theta Z(1) - \frac{1}{2}\theta^2)]$
Price = $e^{-r} (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha - \frac{1}{2}\theta^2) E[\exp((0.2\alpha - \theta) Z(1))]$

$\theta = -0.1$.
$0.2\alpha - \theta = 0.2\alpha - (-0.1) = 0.2\alpha + 0.1$.
$E[\exp((0.2\alpha + 0.1) Z(1))] = \exp(\frac{1}{2}(0.2\alpha + 0.1)^2) = \exp(0.02\alpha^2 + 0.02\alpha + 0.005)$.

$\frac{1}{2}\theta^2 = \frac{1}{2}(-0.1)^2 = 0.005$.

Price = $e^{-0.03} (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.03\alpha - 0.005) \exp(0.02\alpha^2 + 0.02\alpha + 0.005)$
Price = $e^{-0.03} (0.5)^\alpha \exp(0.02\alpha^2 + 0.05\alpha)$.

$(0.5)^\alpha = 1.4 \exp(-0.03\alpha - 0.02\alpha^2)$.

Price = $e^{-0.03} (1.4 \exp(-0.03\alpha - 0.02\alpha^2)) \exp(0.02\alpha^2 + 0.05\alpha)$
Price = $1.4 e^{-0.03} \exp(-0.03\alpha - 0.02\alpha^2 + 0.02\alpha^2 + 0.05\alpha)$
Price = $1.4 e^{-0.03} \exp(0.02\alpha)$
Price = $1.4 \exp(-0.03 + 0.02\alpha)$.

The value of $\alpha \approx -0.5$.
Price = $1.4 \exp(-0.03 + 0.02(-0.5)) = 1.4 \exp(-0.03 - 0.01) = 1.4 \exp(-0.04)$
Price = $1.4 \times 0.960789 = 1.3451$.

Let's recalculate $\alpha$ more precisely.
$0.02\alpha^2 - 0.6631\alpha - 0.3365 = 0$
$\alpha = \frac{0.6631 \pm 0.683096}{0.04}$
$\alpha \approx -0.4999$

If $\alpha = -0.5$,
Price = $1.4 \exp(-0.03 + 0.02(-0.5)) = 1.4 e^{-0.04} = 1.3451046$.

If we keep more precision for $\alpha$:
$\alpha = \frac{0.6631 - \sqrt{0.46662161}}{0.04} = \frac{0.6631 - 0.683096}{0.04} = -0.4999$

Price = $1.4 \exp(-0.03 + 0.02 \times (-0.4999)) = 1.4 \exp(-0.03 - 0.009998)$
Price = $1.4 \exp(-0.039998) = 1.4 \times 0.9607905 = 1.3451067$.

The slight difference is due to rounding of $\alpha$.

Final answer seems to be around $1.345$.

$\alpha = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
where $a = 0.02$, $b = -0.6631$, $c = -0.3365$.

$b^2 = (-0.6631)^2 = 0.43970161$
$4ac = 4(0.02)(-0.3365) = 0.08(-0.3365) = -0.02692$</text>

<text>Let's recalculate $\alpha$ more precisely.
$0.02\alpha^2 - 0.6631\alpha - 0.3365 = 0$
$\alpha = \frac{0.6631 \pm 0.683096}{0.04}$
$\alpha \approx -0.4999$

If $\alpha = -0.5$,
Price = $1.4 \exp(-0.03 + 0.02(-0.5)) = 1.4 e^{-0.04} = 1.3451046$.</text>
<explanation>The solver recalculates the value of α with greater precision to ensure accuracy in the final result, demonstrating careful verification of intermediate calculations.</explanation>

<start>5433</start>
<end>5681</end>
<text>If we keep more precision for $\alpha$:
$\alpha = \frac{0.6631 - \sqrt{0.46662161}}{0.04} = \frac{0.6631 - 0.683096}{0.04} = -0.4999$

Price = $1.4 \exp(-0.03 + 0.02 \times (-0.4999)) = 1.4 \exp(-0.03 - 0.009998)$
Price = $1.4 \exp(-0.039998) = 1.4 \times 0.9607905 = 1.3451067$.</text>
<explanation>The solver performs another calculation with even more precision, comparing the results to ensure consistency, and notes that the slight difference is due to rounding. This demonstrates thoroughness in verification.</explanation>

<text>$\frac{dQ}{dP}\Big|_1 = \exp\left(-(-0.1) Z(1) - \frac{1}{2}(-0.1)^2\right) = \exp\left(0.1 Z(1) - 0.005\right)$

The price of the contingent claim is $e^{-r} E[S(1)^\alpha \frac{dQ}{dP}\Big|_1]$.
Price at time 0 = $e^{-0.03} E[S(1)^\alpha \exp(0.1 Z(1) - 0.005)]$</text>
<explanation>After encountering difficulties with the first approach, the solver strategically decides to apply Girsanov's theorem, demonstrating flexibility in problem-solving and the ability to select alternative techniques when appropriate.</explanation>

<start>4929</start>
<end>5159</end>
<text>The slight difference is due to rounding of $\alpha$.

Final answer seems to be around $1.345$.
