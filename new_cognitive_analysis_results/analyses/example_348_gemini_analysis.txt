Problem:
A.4 In the ultrarelativistic limit, the energy of the electron as a function of time is:

$$
E(t)=\frac{E_{0}}{1+\alpha E_{0} t},
$$

where $E_{0}$ is the initial energy of the electron. Find $\alpha$ as a function of $e, c, B, \epsilon_{0}$ and $m$.

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
The problem provides an equation for the energy of an electron as a function of time in the ultrarelativistic limit and asks to find the constant $\alpha$ in terms of fundamental constants $e, c, B, \epsilon_{0}$ and $m$.

In the ultrarelativistic limit, the speed of the electron is very close to the speed of light $c$. The rate of energy loss for a charged particle accelerating due to a magnetic field is given by the Larmor formula for radiation power, but in a modified form for relativistic speeds. However, the given energy function suggests a simpler approach.

Let's analyze the given equation for energy:
$$
E(t)=\frac{E_{0}}{1+\alpha E_{0} t}
$$
We can find the rate of change of energy with respect to time by differentiating this equation with respect to $t$:
$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{E_{0}}{1+\alpha E_{0} t} \right)
$$
Using the chain rule:
$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = E_{0} \frac{d}{dt} (1+\alpha E_{0} t)^{-1}
$$
$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = E_{0} (-1) (1+\alpha E_{0} t)^{-2} (\alpha E_{0})
$$
$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{\alpha E_{0}^{2}}{(1+\alpha E_{0} t)^{2}}
$$
We know that $E(t)=\frac{E_{0}}{1+\alpha E_{0} t}$, so $E(t)^2 = \frac{E_{0}^{2}}{(1+\alpha E_{0} t)^{2}}$.
Therefore,
$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = -\alpha E(t)^{2}
$$
The rate of energy loss is due to radiation. The power radiated by an accelerating charged particle is given by the relativistic Larmor formula. For a particle moving perpendicular to a magnetic field, the magnitude of the acceleration is $a = \frac{qvB}{\gamma m}$, where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.

In the ultrarelativistic limit, $E \approx pc$, so $p \approx E/c$. Also, $E = \gamma mc^2$, so $\gamma = E/(mc^2)$.

The power radiated by a single electron is given by:
$$
P = -\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{e^2 a^2 \gamma^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3}
$$
Substitute the expression for acceleration $a$:
$$
P = \frac{e^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3} \left( \frac{evB}{\gamma m} \right)^2 \gamma^2
$$
$$
P = \frac{e^4 v^2 B^2 \gamma^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3 \gamma^2 m^2}
$$
In the ultrarelativistic limit, $v \approx c$, so $v^2 \approx c^2$:
$$
P = \frac{e^4 c^2 B^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3 m^2} = \frac{e^4 B^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c m^2}
$$
We also found that $P = -\frac{dE}{dt} = \alpha E^2$.
So,
$$
\alpha E^2 = \frac{e^4 B^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c m^2}
$$
This equation seems to indicate that $\alpha$ depends on $E$, which contradicts the problem statement that $\alpha$ is a constant. Let's re-examine the relativistic Larmor formula.

The relativistic Larmor formula for the power radiated is:
$$
P = \frac{q^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3} a_{\mu} a^{\mu}
$$
where $a_{\mu}$ is the four-acceleration. For motion perpendicular to a magnetic field, the magnitude of the three-acceleration is related to the rate of change of the direction of the velocity.
The rate of energy loss for a relativistic particle in a magnetic field is given by:
$$
-\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{e^2 c}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{d \mathbf{p}}{dt} \frac{1}{mc} \right)^2
$$
This also seems complicated. Let's consider another approach using the properties of synchrotron radiation.

The power radiated by a relativistic electron in a magnetic field is given by:
$$
P = \frac{e^2 c}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \gamma^2 \left[ (\dot{\mathbf{\beta}})^2 - (\mathbf{\beta} \times \dot{\mathbf{\beta}})^2 \right]
$$
For circular motion, $\mathbf{\beta} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{\beta}} = 0$, so $(\mathbf{\beta} \times \dot{\mathbf{\beta}})^2 = \beta^2 (\dot{\mathbf{\beta}})^2$.
$$
P = \frac{e^2 c}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \gamma^2 (\dot{\mathbf{\beta}})^2 (1 - \beta^2) = \frac{e^2 c}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \gamma^2 (\dot{\mathbf{\beta}})^2 \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = \frac{e^2 c}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} (\dot{\mathbf{\beta}})^2
$$
The magnitude of $\dot{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ is $|\dot{\boldsymbol{\beta}}| = \omega \beta \approx \omega = \frac{eB}{E} c$.
So, $(\dot{\boldsymbol{\beta}})^2 = \left( \frac{eBc}{E} \right)^2$.
$$
P = \frac{e^2 c}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{eBc}{E} \right)^2 = \frac{e^4 B^2 c^3}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 E^2}
$$
We have $-\frac{dE}{dt} = P$, so
$$
-\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{e^4 B^2 c^3}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 E^2}
$$
From the given equation, we found $\frac{dE}{dt} = -\alpha E^2$.
Comparing the two expressions for $\frac{dE}{dt}$:
$$
-\alpha E^2 = -\frac{e^4 B^2 c^3}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 E^2}
$$
This again implies $\alpha$ depends on $E$, which is not right.

Let's reconsider the standard formula for synchrotron radiation power:
$$
P = \frac{c e^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \gamma^4 \left( \frac{v}{R} \right)^2
$$
where $R$ is the radius of curvature. The radius of curvature for a particle in a magnetic field is $R = \frac{\gamma mv}{qB} = \frac{\gamma mc}{eB}$ in the ultrarelativistic limit ($v \approx c$).
$$
P = \frac{c e^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \gamma^4 \left( \frac{c}{\frac{\gamma mc}{eB}} \right)^2 = \frac{c e^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \gamma^4 \frac{c^2 e^2 B^2}{\gamma^2 m^2 c^2} = \frac{c e^4 B^2 \gamma^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^2}
$$
Since $E = \gamma mc^2$, we have $\gamma = E/(mc^2)$, so $\gamma^2 = E^2/(m^2 c^4)$.
$$
P = \frac{c e^4 B^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^2} \frac{E^2}{m^2 c^4} = \frac{e^4 B^2 E^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^4 c^3}
$$
We have $-\frac{dE}{dt} = P$, so
$$
-\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{e^4 B^2 E^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^4 c^3}
$$
Comparing this with $\frac{dE}{dt} = -\alpha E^2$, we get:
$$
\alpha E^2 = \frac{e^4 B^2 E^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^4 c^3}
$$
Dividing by $E^2$:
$$
\alpha = \frac{e^4 B^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^4 c^3}
$$
Let's double-check the formula for synchrotron radiation power.

The energy loss per unit time for a relativistic electron in a magnetic field is given by:
$$
-\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{e^2 c}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \gamma^2 (\frac{v}{R})^2
$$
Using $R = \frac{\gamma mc}{eB}$,
$$
-\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{e^2 c}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \gamma^2 (\frac{c}{\frac{\gamma mc}{eB}})^2 = \frac{e^2 c}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \gamma^2 \frac{c^2 e^2 B^2}{\gamma^2 m^2 c^2} = \frac{e^4 B^2 c}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^2}
$$
This result does not depend on $E$. Let's re-examine the derivation of $\frac{dE}{dt} = -\alpha E^2$.

Given $E(t)=\frac{E_{0}}{1+\alpha E_{0} t}$.
Let $y = 1 + \alpha E_0 t$. Then $E(t) = E_0 y^{-1}$.
$\frac{dE}{dt} = E_0 (-1) y^{-2} \frac{dy}{dt} = -E_0 y^{-2} (\alpha E_0) = -\alpha E_0^2 y^{-2} = -\alpha E_0^2 \frac{1}{(1+\alpha E_0 t)^2}$.
Since $E(t) = \frac{E_0}{1+\alpha E_0 t}$, we have $E(t)^2 = \frac{E_0^2}{(1+\alpha E_0 t)^2}$.
So, $\frac{dE}{dt} = -\alpha E(t)^2$. This part of the calculation seems correct.

Now let's review the power radiated by an accelerating charge. The relativistically correct formula for the power radiated by a single charge is:
$$
P = \frac{q^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3} a_{\mu} a^{\mu}
$$
where $a^{\mu} = \frac{d U^{\mu}}{d \tau}$ is the four-acceleration, $U^{\mu}$ is the four-velocity, and $\tau$ is the proper time.
For motion perpendicular to a magnetic field, $a_{\mu} a^{\mu} = \gamma^4 a^2$, where $a$ is the magnitude of the three-acceleration.
$a = \frac{|q| v B \sin \theta}{\gamma m}$. For perpendicular motion, $\sin \theta = 1$.
$a = \frac{|q| v B}{\gamma m}$.
So $a_{\mu} a^{\mu} = \gamma^4 \left( \frac{q v B}{\gamma m} \right)^2 = \frac{q^2 v^2 B^2 \gamma^2}{m^2}$.
$$
P = \frac{q^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3} \frac{q^2 v^2 B^2 \gamma^2}{m^2} = \frac{q^4 v^2 B^2 \gamma^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3 m^2}
$$
In the ultrarelativistic limit, $v \approx c$, and $E = \gamma m c^2$, so $\gamma = E/(mc^2)$.
$$
P = \frac{q^4 c^2 B^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3 m^2} \left( \frac{E}{mc^2} \right)^2 = \frac{q^4 B^2 E^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c m^4 c^4} = \frac{q^4 B^2 E^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^5 m^4}
$$
Equating $P = -\frac{dE}{dt} = \alpha E^2$:
$$
\alpha E^2 = \frac{q^4 B^2 E^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^5 m^4}
$$
$$
\alpha = \frac{q^4 B^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^5 m^4}
$$
Using $q = e$:
$$
\alpha = \frac{e^4 B^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^5 m^4}
$$

Let's check units.
$[\alpha] = T^{-1}$ from $\alpha E_0 t$.
RHS units: $\frac{C^4 T^2 A^2}{C^2 kg m s^{-2} m^3} \frac{1}{m^5 kg^4 s^{-5}} = \frac{C^4 A^2 T^2}{C^2 kg m s^{-2} m^3} \frac{1}{m^5 kg^4 s^{-5}}$
$= \frac{(As)^4 A^2 s^2}{(As)^2 kg m s^{-2} m^3} \frac{1}{m^5 kg^4 s^{-5}} = \frac{A^6 s^6}{A^2 s^2 kg m s^{-2} m^3} \frac{1}{m^5 kg^4 s^{-5}}$
$= \frac{A^4 s^4}{kg m s^{-2} m^3} \frac{1}{m^5 kg^4 s^{-5}} = \frac{A^4 s^6}{kg m^4} \frac{1}{m^5 kg^4 s^{-5}} = \frac{A^4 s^{11}}{kg^5 m^9}$
This doesn't look right.

Let's use the formula for power radiated by a relativistic electron in a magnetic field:
$$
P = \frac{e^2 c}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \gamma^4 \left( \frac{v}{R} \right)^2
$$
Using the Larmor formula in terms of the acceleration components perpendicular and parallel to the velocity:
$$
P = \frac{e^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3} \gamma^6 \left[ a_{\perp}^2 + \gamma^2 a_{\parallel}^2 \right]
$$
For circular motion, $a_{\parallel} = 0$, and $a_{\perp} = \frac{v^2}{R} = \omega v$.
$\omega = \frac{eB}{\gamma m}$.
$a_{\perp} = \frac{eB}{\gamma m} v \approx \frac{eBc}{\gamma m}$.
$$
P = \frac{e^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3} \gamma^6 \left( \frac{eBc}{\gamma m} \right)^2 = \frac{e^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3} \gamma^6 \frac{e^2 B^2 c^2}{\gamma^2 m^2} = \frac{e^4 B^2 c^2 \gamma^4}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3 m^2} = \frac{e^4 B^2 \gamma^4}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c m^2}
$$
Substitute $\gamma = E/(mc^2)$:
$$
P = \frac{e^4 B^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c m^2} \left( \frac{E}{mc^2} \right)^4 = \frac{e^4 B^2 E^4}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c m^6 c^8} = \frac{e^4 B^2 E^4}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^9 m^6}
$$
Equating $P = -\frac{dE}{dt} = \alpha E^2$:
$$
\alpha E^2 = \frac{e^4 B^2 E^4}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^9 m^6}
$$
$$
\alpha = \frac{e^4 B^2 E^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^9 m^6}
$$
This still has a dependence on $E$.

Let's go back to the expression for the rate of energy loss due to synchrotron radiation:
$$
-\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{e^4 c B^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 (mc^2)^2} \left( \frac{E}{mc^2} \right)^2 = \frac{e^4 c B^2 E^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^4 c^6}
$$
Comparing with $-\frac{dE}{dt} = \alpha E^2$:
$$
\alpha E^2 = \frac{e^4 c B^2 E^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^4 c^6}
$$
$$
\alpha = \frac{e^4 B^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^4 c^5}
$$
Let's check units of $\alpha$: $T^{-1}$.
Units of RHS: $\frac{C^4 T^2 A^2}{C^2 kg m s^{-2} m^3} \frac{1}{kg^4 m^4 s^{-5}} = \frac{A^4 s^4}{kg m^4} \frac{1}{kg^4 m^4 s^{-5}} = \frac{A^4 s^9}{kg^5 m^8}$.

Consider the power radiated:
$P = \frac{2}{3} \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3} a^2$, non-relativistic.
Relativistic correction involves $\gamma^6$.

The rate of energy loss for a relativistic electron moving in a circle of radius $R$ in a magnetic field $B$:
$$
-\frac{dE}{dt} = P = \frac{e^2 c}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \gamma^4 \left( \frac{c}{R} \right)^2
$$
$R = \frac{\gamma m v}{eB} \approx \frac{\gamma m c}{eB}$.
$$
P = \frac{e^2 c}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \gamma^4 \left( \frac{c eB}{\gamma m c} \right)^2 = \frac{e^2 c}{6 \pi \epsilon_0} \gamma^4 \frac{e^2 B^2}{\gamma^2 m^2} = \frac{e^4 c B^2 \gamma^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^2}
$$
Substitute $\gamma = E/(mc^2)$:
$$
P = \frac{e^4 c B^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^2} \left( \frac{E}{mc^2} \right)^2 = \frac{e^4 c B^2 E^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^4 c^4} = \frac{e^4 B^2 E^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^4 c^3}
$$
Equating with $-\frac{dE}{dt} = \alpha E^2$:
$$
\alpha E^2 = \frac{e^4 B^2 E^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^4 c^3}
$$
$$
\alpha = \frac{e^4 B^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^4 c^3}
$$
Units: $\frac{C^4 T^2 A^2}{C^2 kg m s^{-2} m^3} \frac{1}{kg^4 m^4 s^{-3}} = \frac{A^4 s^4}{kg m^4} \frac{1}{kg^4 m^4 s^{-3}} = \frac{A^4 s^7}{kg^5 m^8}$.
