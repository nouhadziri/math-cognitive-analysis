Problem:
Serge and Lis each have a machine that prints a digit from 1 to 6. Serge's machine prints the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6$ with probability $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}, p_{5}, p_{6}$, respectively. Lis's machine prints the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6$ with probability $q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, q_{4}, q_{5}, q_{6}$, respectively. Each of the machines prints one digit. Let $S(i)$ be the probability that the sum of the two digits printed is $i$. If $S(2)=S(12)=\frac{1}{2} S(7)$ and $S(7)>0$, prove that $p_{1}=p_{6}$ and $q_{1}=q_{6}$.

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Alright, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have Serge and Lis each with a machine that prints digits 1 through 6. Their machines have different probability distributions: Serge's machine has probabilities p1 to p6, and Lis's has q1 to q6. 

We are told that S(i) is the probability that the sum of the two digits is i. The conditions given are S(2) = S(12) = (1/2) S(7), and S(7) is greater than 0. We need to prove that p1 = p6 and q1 = q6. 

Alright, let's start by recalling that the probability of the sum being i is the sum over all pairs (a, b) such that a + b = i of the product p_a * q_b. That makes sense because each machine's output is independent.

So, S(2) is the probability that the sum is 2. The only pair that adds up to 2 is (1,1). So, S(2) = p1 * q1.

Similarly, S(12) is the probability that the sum is 12. The only pair here is (6,6). So, S(12) = p6 * q6.

And S(7) is the sum of all pairs that add up to 7. Let's list those pairs: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). So, S(7) = p1q6 + p2q5 + p3q4 + p4q3 + p5q2 + p6q1.

We are given that S(2) = S(12) = (1/2) S(7). So,

p1q1 = p6q6 = (1/2)(p1q6 + p2q5 + p3q4 + p4q3 + p5q2 + p6q1).

Also, S(7) > 0, so at least one of those terms in S(7) is positive.

We need to show that p1 = p6 and q1 = q6. 

Let me try to write down the equations we have:

1. p1q1 = p6q6

2. p1q1 + p6q6 = (1/2)(p1q6 + p2q5 + p3q4 + p4q3 + p5q2 + p6q1) ?

Wait, actually no. Wait, S(2) = S(12) = 1/2 S(7), so:

From S(2) = 1/2 S(7) and S(12) = 1/2 S(7), so both S(2) and S(12) equal to the same half of S(7). Therefore, actually S(2) = S(12), which gives us equation 1: p1q1 = p6q6. And both are equal to half of S(7), so 2 p1q1 = S(7). Therefore, 2 p1q1 = p1q6 + p2q5 + p3q4 + p4q3 + p5q2 + p6q1.

So we have two equations:

1. p1q1 = p6q6.

2. 2 p1q1 = p1q6 + p6q1 + p2q5 + p3q4 + p4q3 + p5q2.

So that can be rewritten as:

2 p1q1 = (p1q6 + p6q1) + (p2q5 + p5q2) + (p3q4 + p4q3).

Note that (p2q5 + p5q2) is symmetric with terms p2, p5 and q2, q5. Similarly for (p3q4 + p4q3). Maybe there's a symmetry here.

But we need to prove that p1 = p6 and q1 = q6.

Let me think. Suppose that we want to consider the sum 2 p1q1 = (p1q6 + p6q1) + ... other terms.

We want to show that if the above holds, then p1 must equal p6 and q1 must equal q6. Hmm.

Perhaps we can consider the differences between p1 and p6, and between q1 and q6.

Let me denote a = p1 - p6 and b = q1 - q6. Our goal is to show that a = 0 and b = 0.

But maybe we can manipulate equations to find that a and b have to be zero given the constraints.

Alternatively, maybe use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or AM ≥ GM or something like that?

Wait, the equation is 2 p1 q1 = p1 q6 + p6 q1 + other positive terms. Hmm. Let's isolate the terms involving p1, q1, p6, q6.

So, from equation 2:

2 p1 q1 = p1 q6 + p6 q1 + (p2q5 + p3q4 + p4q3 + p5q2).

Let's rearrange equation 1: p1 q1 = p6 q6.

Perhaps using equation 1 in equation 2. Let me write equation 2 as:

2 p1 q1 = p1 q6 + p6 q1 + [ p2q5 + p5q2 + p3q4 + p4 q3 ]

But from equation 1: since p1 q1 = p6 q6, so the right-hand side has components p1 q6 and p6 q1 which might be connected.

Maybe using that p6 = (p1 q1)/q6, substituting into equation 2. Wait, that could get messy. Let me see.

From equation 1: p6 = (p1 q1)/ q6. Substitute this into equation 2.

So:

2 p1 q1 = p1 q6 + ( (p1 q1)/ q6 ) q1 + [ p2q5 + p5q2 + p3q4 + p4 q3 ]

So:

2 p1 q1 = p1 q6 + (p1 q12)/ q6 + [ p2q5 + p5q2 + p3q4 + p4 q3 ]

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can bring all terms to one side.

Alternatively, multiply both sides by q6:

2 p1 q1 q6 = p1 q62 + p1 q12 + [ p2q5 + p5q2 + p3q4 + p4 q3 ] q6

But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe using Cauchy-Schwarz or arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality. Let's consider the terms p1 q6 and p6 q1.

By AM ≥ GM, (p1 q6 + p6 q1)/2 ≥ sqrt( p1 q6 * p6 q1 ) = sqrt( (p1 p6 q1 q6) ).

But from equation 1, p1 q1 = p6 q6, so (p1 p6 q1 q6) = (p1 q1)^2. So sqrt( (p1 q1)^2 ) = p1 q1.

Thus, (p1 q6 + p6 q1)/2 ≥ p1 q1, which implies p1 q6 + p6 q1 ≥ 2 p1 q1. Equality holds if and only if p1 q6 = p6 q1, i.e., p1 / p6 = q1 / q6.

But in equation 2, we have 2 p1 q1 = p1 q6 + p6 q1 + (other positive terms). Since p1 q6 + p6 q1 >= 2 p1 q1 by AM-GM, then the right-hand side is at least 2 p1 q1 plus the other terms. But the left-hand side is exactly 2 p1 q1. This can happen only if:

1. p1 q6 + p6 q1 = 2 p1 q1 (equality in AM-GM), which requires p1 / p6 = q1 / q6. Let's note this ratio as k: p1 / p6 = q1 / q6 = k.

2. All other terms p2q5, p5q2, p3q4, p4q3 must be zero. So, p2 q5 = p5 q2 = p3 q4 = p4 q3 = 0.

But S(7) = ... includes terms like p2q5, so S(7) > 0 means that at least one of those terms is positive. But here we are arriving at a contradiction unless the other terms are zero, but S(7) is supposed to be positive. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, equation 2 is 2 p1 q1 = p1 q6 + p6 q1 + (other terms). Since the other terms are non-negative, and p1 q6 + p6 q1 >= 2 p1 q1, then unless the other terms are zero, we'd have the RHS > 2 p1 q1, which would contradict the left side being equal. Therefore, we must have that:

1. p1 q6 + p6 q1 = 2 p1 q1 (so equality holds in AM-GM, meaning p1 / p6 = q1 / q6 = k, as above)

2. All the other terms (p2q5, p5q2, p3q4, p4q3) are zero.

But since S(7) > 0, the sum (p1 q6 + p6 q1 + others) = 2 p1 q1 > 0, hence p1 and q1 can't both be zero. Then from the first condition, the other terms are zero. So p2q5 = 0, p5q2 = 0, etc.

But each machine's probabilities must sum to 1, so p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + p5 + p6 = 1, same for q's. So even if some p's are zero, their probabilities are still valid. However, we need to see how these conditions constrain p's and q's.

Given that p2 q5 = 0. Either p2 = 0 or q5 = 0. Similarly, p5 q2 = 0. So either p5 = 0 or q2 = 0. Similarly, p3 q4 = 0 and p4 q3 = 0.

Let's suppose that p2 = 0. Then p2 = 0 implies that q5 can be anything? But p2 q5 = 0 since p2 = 0. Similarly, if p5 q2 = 0, if p2 = 0, we have no condition on q2 unless p5 is non-zero. Wait, it might be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe all the middle terms (p2q5, etc.) being zero would force certain symmetries, but since S(7) still has to be positive, the S(7)= p1 q6 + p6 q1. So if all other terms are zero, then S(7) reduces to p1 q6 + p6 q1, which must be positive, so at least one of p1 q6 or p6 q1 is positive.

But from condition 1, because of p1 q6 = p6 q1 multiplied by k and vice versa. Wait, if p1 / p6 = q1 / q6 = k, then plugging this into equation 1:

From equation 1: p1 q1 = p6 q6. Let's let k = p1 / p6 = q1 / q6. So p1 = k p6 and q1 = k q6. Substitute into equation 1:

(k p6)(k q6) = p6 q6 ⇒ k2 p6 q6 = p6 q6. If p6 q6 ≠ 0, then k2 = 1 ⇒ k = 1 or k = -1. Since probabilities are non-negative, k must be non-negative, so k=1. Thus, p1 = p6 and q1 = q6.

But if p6 q6 =0, then equation 1 would have p1 q1 = 0. But note that if p6 or q6 is zero, then equation 2: S(7) would be p1 q6 + p6 q1 + other terms which are zero. So S(7) would be zero if p1 q6 and p6 q1 are both zero. But condition given is S(7) > 0. Hence, we can't have both p6 and q6 zero. Wait, but if, say, p6 =0, then q6 must not be zero? Wait, if p6 =0, then from p1 q1 = p6 q6 =0, so either p1 =0 or q1=0. But if p6 =0, then q6 must not be zero because S(12) = p6 q6.
But S(12) is part of the given conditions, but if p6 q6 =0, then S(12)=0, and S(2) =0, as p1 q1 =0. Then according to the given conditions, S(2) = S(12) = (1/2) S(7). Therefore, S(7) =0. But S(7) is supposed to be >0. Hence, the case where p6 q6=0 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, p6 q6 ≠0. Therefore, we must have k=1. Therefore, p1=p6 and q1=q6.

Thus, this yields p1 = p6 and q1 = q6 as required.

Wait, so this makes sense? Essentially, the key steps are:

1. From the given S(2)=S(12)=1/2 S(7), we get p1q1 = p6q6 and 2 p1q1 = sum of the S(7) terms.

2. Breaking down S(7) into p1q6 + p6q1 + other terms, since the other terms have to be zero (because AM-GM requires the first two terms to be at least 2 p1 q1, and they can't exceed that as the left side is exactly 2 p1 q1).

3. Therefore, all the other terms in S(7) (the ones except p1q6 and p6q1) must be zero.

4. This forces p2q5=0, p5q2=0, etc., which would be possible only if certain probabilities are zero. However, given that p's and q's are probability distributions and that S(7) >0, we must have that p1q6 + p6q1 >0.

5. Then with the ratio from AM-GM requiring p1/p6 = q1/q6, leading to p1 = p6 and q1 = q6.

Therefore, we end up with the desired conclusion.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{p_1 = p_6} \text{ and } \boxed{q_1 = q_6}

<text>Alternatively, maybe using Cauchy-Schwarz or arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality. Let's consider the terms p1 q6 and p6 q1.

By AM ≥ GM, (p1 q6 + p6 q1)/2 ≥ sqrt( p1 q6 * p6 q1 ) = sqrt( (p1 p6 q1 q6) ).

But from equation 1, p1 q1 = p6 q6, so (p1 p6 q1 q6) = (p1 q1)^2. So sqrt( (p1 q1)^2 ) = p1 q1.

Thus, (p1 q6 + p6 q1)/2 ≥ p1 q1, which implies p1 q6 + p6 q1 ≥ 2 p1 q1. Equality holds if and only if p1 q6 = p6 q1, i.e., p1 / p6 = q1 / q6.</text>

<text>But in equation 2, we have 2 p1 q1 = p1 q6 + p6 q1 + (other positive terms). Since p1 q6 + p6 q1 >= 2 p1 q1 by AM-GM, then the right-hand side is at least 2 p1 q1 plus the other terms. But the left-hand side is exactly 2 p1 q1. This can happen only if:

1. p1 q6 + p6 q1 = 2 p1 q1 (equality in AM-GM), which requires p1 / p6 = q1 / q6. Let's note this ratio as k: p1 / p6 = q1 / q6 = k.

2. All other terms p2q5, p5q2, p3q4, p4q3 must be zero. So, p2 q5 = p5 q2 = p3 q4 = p4 q3 = 0.

But S(7) = ... includes terms like p2q5, so S(7) > 0 means that at least one of those terms is positive.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes how the AM-GM inequality interacts with the equation for S(7), deducing that equality must hold in the inequality and all other terms must be zero, then recognizing a potential contradiction with the constraint that S(7) > 0.</explanation>

<start>5119</start>

<text>Given that p2 q5 = 0. Either p2 = 0 or q5 = 0. Similarly, p5 q2 = 0. So either p5 = 0 or q2 = 0. Similarly, p3 q4 = 0 and p4 q3 = 0.

Let's suppose that p2 = 0. Then p2 = 0 implies that q5 can be anything? But p2 q5 = 0 since p2 = 0. Similarly, if p5 q2 = 0, if p2 = 0, we have no condition on q2 unless p5 is non-zero.</text>

<start>6022</start>
<end>6499</end>
<text>From equation 1: p1 q1 = p6 q6. Let's let k = p1 / p6 = q1 / q6. So p1 = k p6 and q1 = k q6. Substitute into equation 1:

(k p6)(k q6) = p6 q6 ⇒ k2 p6 q6 = p6 q6. If p6 q6 ≠ 0, then k2 = 1 ⇒ k = 1 or k = -1. Since probabilities are non-negative, k must be non-negative, so k=1. Thus, p1 = p6 and q1 = q6.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses logical deduction to determine that if p1/p6 = q1/q6 = k, then k must equal 1, leading to the conclusion that p1 = p6 and q1 = q6.</explanation>

<start>6501</start>
<end>7022</end>
<text>But if p6 q6 =0, then equation 1 would have p1 q1 = 0. But note that if p6 or q6 is zero, then equation 2: S(7) would be p1 q6 + p6 q1 + other terms which are zero. So S(7) would be zero if p1 q6 and p6 q1 are both zero. But condition given is S(7) > 0. Hence, we can't have both p6 and q6 zero. Wait, but if, say, p6 =0, then q6 must not be zero? Wait, if p6 =0, then from p1 q1 = p6 q6 =0, so either p1 =0 or q1=0. But if p6 =0, then q6 must not be zero because S(12) = p6 q6.</text>
<explanation>The solver examines the case where p6q6 = 0, using logical deduction to analyze what this would imply for other variables and whether it's consistent with the given constraints.</explanation>

<start>7022</start>
<end>7438</end>
<text>But S(12) is part of the given conditions, but if p6 q6 =0, then S(12)=0, and S(2) =0, as p1 q1 =0. Then according to the given conditions, S(2) = S(12) = (1/2) S(7). Therefore, S(7) =0. But S(7) is supposed to be >0. Hence, the case where p6 q6=0 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, p6 q6 ≠0. Therefore, we must have k=1. Therefore, p1=p6 and q1=q6.</text>
<explanation>The solver completes the logical deduction by showing that p6q6 = 0 would lead to S(7) = 0, contradicting the given condition that S(7) > 0, thus proving that p1 = p6 and q1 = q6.</explanation>

<skill>Solution Verification</skill>
<definition>The ability to check and confirm that a proposed solution satisfies all the conditions of the problem.</definition>

<start>7485</start>
<end>8046</end>
<text>Wait, so this makes sense? Essentially, the key steps are:

1. From the given S(2)=S(12)=1/2 S(7), we get p1q1 = p6q6 and 2 p1q1 = sum of the S(7) terms.

2. Breaking down S(7) into p1q6 + p6q1 + other terms, since the other terms have to be zero (because AM-GM requires the first two terms to be at least 2 p1 q1, and they can't exceed that as the left side is exactly 2 p1 q1).

3. Therefore, all the other terms in S(7) (the ones except p1q6 and p6q1) must be zero.

4. This forces p2q5=0, p5q2=0, etc., which would be possible only if certain probabilities are zero. However, given that p's and q's are probability distributions and that S(7) >0, we must have that p1q6 + p6q1 >0.
