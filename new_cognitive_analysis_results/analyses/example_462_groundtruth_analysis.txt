Problem:
Let  $G_1$  and  $G_2$  be two finite groups such that for any finite group  $H$ , the number of group homomorphisms from  $G_1$  to  $H$  is equal to the number of group homomorphisms from  $G_2$  to  $H$ . Prove that  $G_1$  and  $G_2$  are Isomorphic.

Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Define the problem and notation:**
   Let \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \) be two finite groups such that for any finite group \( H \), the number of group homomorphisms from \( G_1 \) to \( H \) is equal to the number of group homomorphisms from \( G_2 \) to \( H \). We need to prove that \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \) are isomorphic.

2. **Introduce the concept of onto homomorphisms:**
   Denote \( \text{OntHom}(G, H) \) as the set of all onto homomorphisms from \( G \) to \( H \). Let \( H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_k \) be all pairwise different proper subgroups of \( H \).

3. **Count the onto homomorphisms:**
   Since \( \text{OntHom}(G, H_i) \cap \text{OntHom}(G, H_j) = \emptyset \) for any two \( i \neq j \), we have:
   \[
   |\text{OntHom}(G, H)| = |\text{Hom}(G, H)| - \sum_{i=1}^{k} |\text{OntHom}(G, H_i)|
   \]
   This equation expresses the number of onto homomorphisms from \( G \) to \( H \) in terms of the number of homomorphisms from \( G \) to \( H \) and the number of onto homomorphisms from \( G \) to the proper subgroups of \( H \).

4. **Recursive application to proper subgroups:**
   By applying the same reasoning to every proper subgroup \( H_i \) of \( H \), we can write \( |\text{OntHom}(G, H)| \) as a linear combination of \( |\text{Hom}(G, H_i)| \) for all subgroups \( H_i \) of \( H \). Since \( H \) is finite, this linear combination converges.

5. **Equality of homomorphisms implies equality of onto homomorphisms:**
   Given that \( |\text{Hom}(G_1, H)| = |\text{Hom}(G_2, H)| \) for any finite \( H \), it follows that:
   \[
   |\text{OntHom}(G_1, H)| = |\text{OntHom}(G_2, H)|
   \]
   for any finite \( H \).

6. **Application to \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \):**
   Taking \( H = G_2 \), we have \( |\text{OntHom}(G_1, G_2)| > 0 \) and similarly, taking \( H = G_1 \), we have \( |\text{OntHom}(G_2, G_1)| > 0 \). This implies that there exist onto homomorphisms from \( G_1 \) to \( G_2 \) and from \( G_2 \) to \( G_1 \).

7. **Conclusion of isomorphism:**
   Since there exist onto homomorphisms in both directions, \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \) must have the same order, i.e., \( |G_1| = |G_2| \). An onto homomorphism between two finite groups of the same order is a bijection, hence an isomorphism. Therefore, \( G_1 \cong G_2 \).

   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver makes a crucial logical inference: if the total number of homomorphisms is equal for G₁ and G₂, and the recursive formula for onto homomorphisms depends only on these counts, then the number of onto homomorphisms must also be equal.
