Problem:
The medium of thin layer chromatography plates are primarily silica, but are often doped with Zinc silicate to facilitate visualization of many organic compounds on the plate. These organic compounds give dark contrast to the plate's luminescence when it is illuminated with 254nm light. What is the root cause of the appearance of dark contrast to the plate's luminescence?
Answer Choices:
(A) the small organic molecules fill the voids in the matrix of the plate which prevents electrons from entering those voids upon excitation by the 254nm light, thus preventing the zinc silicate on the part of the plate with the organic molecules from exhibiting persistent luminescence, resulting in a dark spot.
(B) The compounds allow the excited state of the zinc sillicate to nonradiatively transfer its energy to the organic compound, returning them to the ground state nonradiatively. The organic compound then itself returns to the ground state nonradiatively, so no light is emitted, resulting in a dark spot.
(C) The organic compounds that give a dark contrast on the plate have a significant absorbance at 254nm, and block the light from exciting the zinc silicate, resulting in a dark spot.
(D) The organic comounds are also fluorescent, with an excitation wavelength of 254nm but with a lower intensity and a shorter emission wavelength than the zinc silicate, and thus compete with the zinc silicate's fluorescence thus significantly weakening it, resulting in a dark spot.

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
The main factor in the creation of the dark spots by certain organic compounds is their ability to quench the fluorescence of the additive to the plate silica, by interacting with and quenching the excited state, and then releasing the energy non-radiatively. Most of the compounds do in fact absorb 254nm light, but they aren't opaque enough for the very small amount of them on the plate to significantly block the light. Their own fluorescence is also irrelevant to this process. The luminescence of the plate is caused by fluorescence, not persistent luminescence.
