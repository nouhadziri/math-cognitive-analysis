Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the length of the altitude to the base $EM$ of an isosceles triangle $GEM$, given that the base $EM$ is a side of a square $AIME$, and the area of the intersection of the triangle and the square is $80$ square units.

Let the square $AIME$ be in the coordinate plane. We can place the vertices of the square at $A=(0,10)$, $I=(10,10)$, $M=(10,0)$, $E=(0,0)$. The side length of the square is $10$.

The base of the isosceles triangle $GEM$ is $EM$. The vertices of the base are $E=(0,0)$ and $M=(10,0)$. The length of the base $EM$ is $\sqrt{(10-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \sqrt{10^2} = 10$.

The third vertex of the isosceles triangle is $G$. Since the triangle is isosceles with base $EM$, the vertex $G$ must lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment $EM$. The midpoint of $EM$ is $\left(\frac{0+10}{2}, \frac{0+0}{2}\right) = (5, 0)$. The line segment $EM$ lies on the x-axis. The perpendicular bisector of $EM$ is the vertical line passing through the midpoint $(5, 0)$, which is the line $x=5$.
The coordinates of $G$ are of the form $(5, y)$, where $y$ is some value.

Let the altitude from $G$ to the base $EM$ intersect $EM$ at point $P$. Since $\triangle GEM$ is isosceles with $GE = GM$, the altitude from $G$ to $EM$ also bisects $EM$. Thus, $P$ is the midpoint of $EM$, which is $(5, 0)$.
The length of the altitude $GP$ is $|y - 0| = |y|$.

The area of the intersection of $\triangle GEM$ and square $AIME$ is $80$ square units.

The square $AIME$ occupies the region $0 \le x \le 10$ and $0 \le y \le 10$.

Case 1: The vertex $G$ is inside or on the boundary of the square.
If $G$ is inside the square, its coordinates are $(5, y)$ where $0 \le y \le 10$.
The vertices of the triangle are $G=(5, y)$, $E=(0,0)$, $M=(10,0)$.
The intersection of the triangle and the square is the triangle itself, since all vertices are within or on the boundary of the square.
The area of $\triangle GEM = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times EM \times GP = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times |y| = 5|y|$.
Since $y \ge 0$ in this case, $|y| = y$.
Area of $\triangle GEM = 5y$.
If the intersection area is $80$, then $5y = 80$, so $y = 16$.
However, this contradicts the assumption that $0 \le y \le 10$. Thus, $G$ cannot be inside or on the top boundary of the square.

Case 2: The vertex $G$ is outside the square, above the side $AI$.
In this case, the y-coordinate of $G$ is $y > 10$.
The coordinates of $G$ are $(5, h)$, where $h > 10$. The altitude of $\triangle GEM$ is $h$.

The intersection of $\triangle GEM$ and the square $AIME$ forms a trapezoid. The vertices of the trapezoid are $E=(0,0)$, $M=(10,0)$, and two points on the sides of the square.

The line $EG$ passes through $(0,0)$ and $(5, h)$. The equation of the line is $y = \frac{h}{5} x$.
The line $MG$ passes through $(10,0)$ and $(5, h)$. The slope is $\frac{h-0}{5-10} = \frac{h}{-5}$.
The equation of the line $MG$ is $y - 0 = -\frac{h}{5} (x - 10)$, so $y = -\frac{h}{5} x + 2h$.

The intersection of line $EG$ with the top side of the square $y=10$:
$10 = \frac{h}{5} x \implies x = \frac{50}{h}$.
The intersection point is $(\frac{50}{h}, 10)$.

The intersection of line $MG$ with the top side of the square $y=10$:
$10 = -\frac{h}{5} x + 2h \implies \frac{h}{5} x = 2h - 10 \implies x = \frac{5(2h-10)}{h} = \frac{10h - 50}{h} = 10 - \frac{50}{h}$.
The intersection point is $(10 - \frac{50}{h}, 10)$.

The intersection of $\triangle GEM$ and square $AIME$ is a trapezoid with vertices $E=(0,0)$, $M=(10,0)$, $P_1 = (\frac{50}{h}, 10)$, $P_2 = (10 - \frac{50}{h}, 10)$.
The parallel sides of the trapezoid are on the lines $y=0$ and $y=10$.
The height of the trapezoid is $10$.
The lengths of the parallel sides are the distances between the x-coordinates of the vertices at $y=0$ and $y=10$.
At $y=0$, the segment is $EM$, length $10$.
At $y=10$, the segment is between $x = \frac{50}{h}$ and $x = 10 - \frac{50}{h}$.
Length of the top side of the trapezoid = $(10 - \frac{50}{h}) - \frac{50}{h} = 10 - \frac{100}{h}$.

The area of the trapezoid is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{height} \times (\text{sum of parallel sides})$
Area $= \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times (10 + (10 - \frac{100}{h})) = 5 \times (20 - \frac{100}{h}) = 100 - \frac{500}{h}$.

We are given that the area of the intersection is $80$.
$100 - \frac{500}{h} = 80$
$100 - 80 = \frac{500}{h}$
$20 = \frac{500}{h}$
$h = \frac{500}{20} = 25$.

The length of the altitude to $EM$ in $\triangle GEM$ is the y-coordinate of $G$, which is $h$.
The altitude is $25$.

Let's double-check the calculations.
If $h=25$, the intersection points with the top of the square are:
$x_1 = \frac{50}{25} = 2$
$x_2 = 10 - \frac{50}{25} = 10 - 2 = 8$.
The top side of the trapezoid is between $x=2$ and $x=8$, length $8-2 = 6$.
Area of trapezoid $= \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times (10 + 6) = 5 \times 16 = 80$. This matches the given area.

The length of the altitude to $EM$ in $\triangle GEM$ is the height from $G$ to the line containing $EM$ (the x-axis).
If $G = (5, h)$, the altitude is $|h|$. Since $G$ is above $EM$, $h > 0$, so the altitude is $h$.
In this case, $h = 25$.

Alternative approach without coordinates:

The square $AIME$ has vertices in counterclockwise order.
The base of $\triangle GEM$ is $EM$. Length $EM = 10$.
The altitude to $EM$ in $\triangle GEM$ passes through $G$ and is perpendicular to $EM$. Let the foot of the altitude be $P$. Since $\triangle GEM$ is isosceles, $P$ is the midpoint of $EM$.

The region of intersection is within the square.
The intersection is a polygon. The vertices of the intersection are vertices of the square or points where the sides of the triangle intersect the sides of the square.

Consider the position of vertex $G$. Since $\triangle GEM$ is isosceles with base $EM$, $G$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $EM$.
Let the plane of the square be the xy-plane.
Assume $E=(0,0)$, $M=(10,0)$, $I=(10,10)$, $A=(0,10)$.
The perpendicular bisector of $EM$ is the line $x=5$.
So $G$ has coordinates $(5, y)$.

If $0 < y \le 10$, $G$ is inside or on the top boundary of the square. The triangle is contained within the region $0 \le y$.
The vertices of $\triangle GEM$ are $(5, y), (0,0), (10,0)$.
The base is $EM$ on the x-axis, length $10$.
The height of the triangle is $|y|$. Since $y > 0$, height $= y$.
Area of $\triangle GEM = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times y = 5y$.
If the intersection area is $80$, then $5y = 80$, $y = 16$.
This contradicts $y \le 10$.

If $y > 10$, $G$ is outside the square, above the side $AI$.
The intersection is a trapezoid with vertices $E, M$ and two points on the top edge of the square.
Let the altitude of $\triangle GEM$ be $h = y$.
The height of the trapezoid is $10$.
The bases of the trapezoid are $EM = 10$ and the segment on the line $y=10$.

Consider the equation of line $EG$. It passes through $(0,0)$ and $(5, y)$. Slope $= \frac{y}{5}$. Equation $y' = \frac{y}{5} x'$.
Intersection with $y'=10$: $10 = \frac{y}{5} x' \implies x' = \frac{50}{y}$.
Point $(\frac{50}{y}, 10)$.

Consider the equation of line $MG$. It passes through $(10,0)$ and $(5, y)$. Slope $= \frac{y-0}{5-10} = -\frac{y}{5}$.
Equation $y' - 0 = -\frac{y}{5} (x' - 10) \implies y' = -\frac{y}{5} x' + 2y$.
Intersection with $y'=10$: $10 = -\frac{y}{5} x' + 2y \implies \frac{y}{5} x' = 2y - 10 \implies x' = \frac{5(2y-10)}{y} = 10 - \frac{50}{y}$.
Point $(10 - \frac{50}{y}, 10)$.

The top base of the trapezoid is from $x = \frac{50}{y}$ to $x = 10 - \frac{50}{y}$.
Length $= (10 - \frac{50}{y}) - \frac{50}{y} = 10 - \frac{100}{y}$.

Area of trapezoid $= \frac{1}{2} \times \text{height} \times (\text{sum of bases})$
Area $= \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times (10 + 10 - \frac{100}{y}) = 5 \times (20 - \frac{100}{y}) = 100 - \frac{500}{y}$.

Given area $= 80$.
$100 - \frac{500}{y} = 80$
$20 = \frac{500}{y}$
$y = \frac{500}{20} = 25$.

The altitude to $EM$ in $\triangle GEM$ is the distance from $G$ to the line containing $EM$.
The line containing $EM$ is the x-axis.
The altitude is the y-coordinate of $G$, which is $y$.
Altitude $= 25$.

Consider the case where $G$ is below the side $ME$ of the square, $y < 0$.
In this case, the intersection would be the triangle itself, area $5|y| = -5y$.
If $-5y = 80$, $y = -16$.
The vertex $G = (5, -16)$.
The intersection of the triangle with the square is the triangle with vertices $E=(0,0), M=(10,0)$ and the intersections of $GE, GM$ with the edges of the square.

Equation of $EG$: $y = \frac{-16}{5} x$.
Equation of $MG$: $y = \frac{-16}{-5} (x-10) = \frac{16}{5} (x-10)$.

Intersection of $EG$ with the square:
With $x=10$: $y = \frac{-16}{5} \times 10 = -32$, outside the square.
With $y=-10$: $-10 = \frac{-16}{5} x \implies x = \frac{50}{16} = \frac{25}{8}$. Point $(\frac{25}{8}, -10)$.

Intersection of $MG$ with the square:
With $x=0$: $y = \frac{16}{5} (-10) = -32$, outside the square.
With $y=-10$: $-10 = \frac{16}{5} (x-10) \implies -50 = 16x - 160 \implies 110 = 16x \implies x = \frac{110}{16} = \frac{55}{8}$. Point $(\frac{55}{8}, -10)$.

The intersection is a triangle with vertices $E=(0,0)$, $M=(10,0)$, and the intersections on $y=-10$.
This is not possible, as the triangle lies below the x-axis, and the square is above.
The intersection must be a polygon within the square.

Let's rethink the shape of the intersection.

If $G$ is above the square, the intersection is a trapezoid.
If $G$ is below the segment $EM$, the triangle is below the x-axis, and the intersection is empty.

Consider the geometry of the situation.
Square $AIME$. Triangle $GEM$ isosceles with base $EM$.
The common area is within the square.
The vertices of the common area are $E, M$ and the intersections of $GE, GM$ with the sides of the square.

If $G$ is far above the square, the triangle is wide, and the intersection is a trapezoid.
If $G$ is slightly above the square, the intersection is a trapezoid.
If $G$ is on the top edge of the square, the triangle shares the top edge with the square.

Let the altitude of $\triangle GEM$ be $h$.
Area of $\triangle GEM = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times h = 5h$.

If the entire triangle is within the square, area $= 5h = 80$, $h=16$.
The height of the square is $10$. If $h=16$, $G$ is above the square.

Consider the case where the vertex $G$ is above the square.
The intersection is a trapezoid with height $10$.
Bases are $EM = 10$ and the segment on the top edge of the square.
The length of the top segment is $10 - \frac{100}{h}$.
Area $= \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times (10 + 10 - \frac{100}{h}) = 80$.
$5 \times (20 - \frac{100}{h}) = 80$
$20 - \frac{100}{h} = 16$
$4 = \frac{100}{h}$
$h = 25$.

The length of the altitude to $EM$ is $h$.

Final check of the problem statement:
Square $AIME$, sides length $10$.
Isosceles triangle $GEM$, base $EM$.
Area common to triangle and square is $80$.
Find the length of the altitude to $EM$ in $\triangle GEM$.

The altitude to $EM$ is the distance from $G$ to the line $EM$.
If $G=(5, y)$, the altitude is $|y|$.
Since the area is positive, the triangle must overlap with the square.

If $G$ is below $EM$, the triangle is below the x-axis, no overlap.

If $0 < y \le 10$, area $= 5y = 80$, $y=16$, contradiction.

If $y > 10$, area of intersection $= 80$, leads to $y=25$.
The altitude is $y = 25$.

Consider the wording: "the altitude to $EM$ in $\triangle GEM$". This is the height of the triangle.

If $G=(5, y)$, the altitude is $|y|$.
Since the area is positive, the triangle must overlap with the square.

If $G$ is below $EM$, the triangle is below the x-axis, no overlap.

If $0 < y \le 10$, area $= 5y = 80$, $y=16$, contradiction.

If $y > 10$, area of intersection $= 80$, leads to $y=25$.
The altitude is $y = 25$.</text>
<explanation>The solver performs a comprehensive final check by restating the problem, reviewing the definition of the altitude, and summarizing the different cases they considered, confirming that y=25 is the only valid solution.</explanation>
