Problem:
Freddy the frog is jumping around the coordinate plane searching for a river, which lies on the horizontal line $y = 24$ . A fence is located at the horizontal line $y = 0$ . On each jump Freddy randomly chooses a direction parallel to one of the coordinate axes and moves one unit in that direction. When he is at a point where $y=0$ , with equal likelihoods he chooses one of three directions where he either jumps parallel to the fence or jumps away from the fence, but he never chooses the direction that would have him cross over the fence to where $y < 0$ . Freddy starts his search at the point $(0, 21)$ and will stop once he reaches a point on the river. Find the expected number of jumps it will take Freddy to reach the river.

<text>273</text>
<explanation>The solver has arrived at a precise numerical answer of 273, which represents the expected number of jumps. This demonstrates numerical reasoning as they have processed the probabilistic scenario and calculated a specific value as the solution. While the working isn't shown, arriving at this exact number requires numerical computation skills.</explanation>

<definition>The ability to reason about uncertain events, understand probability distributions, and calculate expected values based on random processes.</definition>

<text>273</text>
<explanation>The problem involves a random walk with specific transition probabilities (equal likelihoods of three directions at y=0). The answer of 273 represents an expected value calculation for a stochastic process, which requires understanding of probability theory and expected value computations for random walks.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Modeling</skill>
<definition>The ability to translate a real-world scenario into mathematical terms, identifying relevant variables and relationships that can be analyzed using mathematical tools.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>273</text>
<explanation>The solver has modeled Freddy's movement as a random walk on a coordinate plane with boundary conditions (the fence at y=0 and the river at y=24). They have translated the physical constraints and movement rules into a mathematical framework that allows for calculation of the expected number of jumps.</explanation>

<skill>Markov Process Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to analyze systems where the future state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it, often using transition probabilities between states.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>273</text>
<explanation>The frog's movement can be modeled as a Markov process where the probability of the next position depends only on the current position. The solver has likely used techniques from Markov process theory to calculate the expected number of steps to absorption (reaching the river), which is a classic application of Markov chains.</explanation>

<skill>Boundary Condition Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and correctly handle special cases at the boundaries of a problem domain, where standard rules may need modification.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>273</text>
<explanation>The problem has specific boundary conditions: at y=0 (the fence), the frog has different movement probabilities than elsewhere in the plane. The solver has correctly incorporated these boundary conditions into their analysis to arrive at the answer, showing they understand how to handle special cases at boundaries.</explanation>
