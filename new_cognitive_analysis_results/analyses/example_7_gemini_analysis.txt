the following: 
The average of all participants is  $66$ , that of the promoted  $71$  and that of the repeaters  $56$ .

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let $N$ be the total number of participants, $N < 40$.
Let $P$ be the number of promoted participants and $R$ be the number of repeaters.
Then $N = P + R$.

Let $S_{all}$ be the sum of the scores of all participants before the increase.
Let $S_P$ be the sum of the scores of promoted participants before the increase.
Let $S_R$ be the sum of the scores of repeaters before the increase.

We are given the following averages before the increase:
Average of all participants = $66$, so $S_{all}/N = 66$, which means $S_{all} = 66N$.
Average of promoted participants = $71$, so $S_P/P = 71$, which means $S_P = 71P$.
Average of repeaters = $56$, so $S_R/R = 56$, which means $S_R = 56R$.

We know that $S_{all} = S_P + S_R$.
So, $66N = 71P + 56R$.
Since $N = P + R$, we have $R = N - P$.
Substituting $R$ in the equation: $66N = 71P + 56(N - P)$
$66N = 71P + 56N - 56P$
$66N - 56N = 71P - 56P$
$10N = 15P$
$2N = 3P$

This means that $P$ must be an even number and $N$ must be a multiple of 3.
Let $P = 2k$, then $N = 3k$.
Since $N < 40$, we have $3k < 40$, so $k \le 13$.
Since $P \le N$, this condition is always satisfied.

After the increase of 5 in all scores:
The new average of promoted participants is $75$.
The new sum of scores of promoted participants is $S'_P = S_P + 5P$.
The new average of promoted participants is $S'_P/P = (S_P + 5P)/P = S_P/P + 5 = 71 + 5 = 76$.
This contradicts the given information that the new average is $75$.

Let's re-examine the problem statement. The scores are increased by 5.
The new average of promoted participants is 75.
The new average of repeaters is 59.

Let the new sum of scores of promoted participants be $S'_P$ and the new sum of scores of repeaters be $S'_R$.
$S'_P / P = 75 \implies S'_P = 75P$.
$S'_R / R = 59 \implies S'_R = 59R$.

We know that the original scores were increased by 5 for each participant.
So, $S'_P = S_P + 5P$ and $S'_R = S_R + 5R$.
$75P = S_P + 5P \implies S_P = 70P$.
$59R = S_R + 5R \implies S_R = 54R$.

From the initial conditions, we had $S_P = 71P$ and $S_R = 56R$.
This seems contradictory. Let's rethink the meaning of "promoted". The passmark is 65. So, promoted means the score was $\ge 65$.

Let $x_i$ be the original scores. Promoted participants have $x_i \ge 65$. Repeaters have $x_i < 65$.
After the increase, the new scores are $x_i + 5$.
The new passmark is $65 + 5 = 70$.
The participants who are promoted after the increase have $x_i + 5 \ge 70$, which means $x_i \ge 65$. The set of promoted participants remains the same.

Let's use the information about the averages after the increase.
The new average of promoted participants is $75$.
The sum of the new scores of promoted participants is $S_P + 5P$.
So, $(S_P + 5P)/P = 75$, which means $S_P + 5P = 75P$, so $S_P = 70P$.

The new average of non-promoted (repeaters) is $59$.
The sum of the new scores of repeaters is $S_R + 5R$.
So, $(S_R + 5R)/R = 59$, which means $S_R + 5R = 59R$, so $S_R = 54R$.

Now we use the initial average information:
Average of all participants is $66$: $S_{all}/N = 66 \implies S_P + S_R = 66N$.
Substitute $S_P = 70P$ and $S_R = 54R$:
$70P + 54R = 66N$.
Since $N = P + R$, we have $70P + 54R = 66(P + R)$.
$70P + 54R = 66P + 66R$.
$70P - 66P = 66R - 54R$.
$4P = 12R$.
$P = 3R$.

We also have the condition from the initial averages of promoted and repeaters:
$S_P/P = 71 \implies 70P/P = 71$, which implies $70 = 71$. This is a contradiction.

Let's assume the groups of promoted and repeaters might change after the increase.
Initial state:
Average of all participants = $66 \implies S_{all} = 66N$.
Average of initially promoted = $71 \implies S_P = 71P$.
Average of initially repeaters = $56 \implies S_R = 56R$.
$66N = 71P + 56R$.
$66(P+R) = 71P + 56R$.
$66P + 66R = 71P + 56R$.
$10R = 5P$.
$2R = P$.

After the increase:
Average of finally promoted = $75$. Let the number of finally promoted be $P'$.
Average of finally non-promoted = $59$. Let the number of finally non-promoted be $R'$.
The scores of all participants increase by 5.
The sum of the new scores of initially promoted is $S_P + 5P$.
The sum of the new scores of initially repeaters is $S_R + 5R$.

The set of finally promoted are those whose new score is $\ge 70$.
The set of finally non-promoted are those whose new score is $< 70$.

Let's consider the averages after the increase.
The average of the scores after increase for the initially promoted is $(S_P + 5P)/P = 71 + 5 = 76$.
The average of the scores after increase for the initially repeaters is $(S_R + 5R)/R = 56 + 5 = 61$.

This does not match the given averages after the increase.
The wording "the promoted" and "the non-promoted" likely refers to the status after the increase.

Let the set of participants promoted after the increase be $A$, $|A| = P'$, average = $75$.
Let the set of participants non-promoted after the increase be $B$, $|B| = R'$, average = $59$.
$P' + R' = N$.

Sum of scores of promoted after increase = $75P'$.
Sum of scores of non-promoted after increase = $59R'$.
The scores before increase for the promoted group are $y_i$, $y_i + 5 \ge 70 \implies y_i \ge 65$.
The scores before increase for the non-promoted group are $z_i$, $z_i + 5 < 70 \implies z_i < 65$.
So, the groups before and after the increase are the same.
$P' = P$ and $R' = R$.

Using the averages after the increase:
Average of promoted after increase = $75 \implies (S_P + 5P)/P = 75 \implies S_P = 70P$.
Average of non-promoted after increase = $59 \implies (S_R + 5R)/R = 59 \implies S_R = 54R$.

Using the averages before the increase:
Average of all = $66 \implies S_P + S_R = 66N$.
$70P + 54R = 66(P+R)$.
$70P + 54R = 66P + 66R$.
$4P = 12R$.
$P = 3R$.

We also have the condition from before the increase:
Average of promoted = $71 \implies S_P/P = 71 \implies 70P/P = 71 \implies 70 = 71$ (contradiction).

Let's assume the problem implies that the labels "promoted" and "repeaters" change after the score increase based on the new passmark.

Original passmark = 65.
New passmark = 70.

Let the original scores be $x_i$.
Initially promoted: $x_i \ge 65$. Number $= P$. Sum $= S_P$. Average $= 71$.
Initially repeaters: $x_i < 65$. Number $= R$. Sum $= S_R$. Average $= 56$.

After increase, new scores are $x_i + 5$.
Finally promoted: $x_i + 5 \ge 70 \implies x_i \ge 65$. The same group.
Finally non-promoted: $x_i + 5 < 70 \implies x_i < 65$. The same group.

So, the groups remain the same.

Possibility: The problem statement means that the categories of promoted and repeaters are based on the situation at that time.

Initial situation:
Average of all participants is $66$: $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N x_i}{N} = 66$.
Average of promoted is $71$: $\frac{\sum_{promoted} x_i}{P} = 71$.
Average of repeaters is $56$: $\frac{\sum_{repeaters} x_i}{R} = 56$.

After the increase: new scores $y_i = x_i + 5$.
Average of newly promoted is $75$: $\frac{\sum_{newly promoted} (x_i + 5)}{P'} = 75$.
Average of newly non-promoted is $59$: $\frac{\sum_{newly non-promoted} (x_i + 5)}{R'} = 59$.

The passmark is fixed at 65.
Initially promoted: score $\ge 65$.
After increase, the passmark is still effectively at 65 for defining promoted/non-promoted.

If the passmark remains at 65, the groups don't change.

Let's reconsider the interpretation of the averages after the increase.
The "promoted participants" after the increase refers to those who would pass with the increased scores and the original passmark.

If the passmark is fixed at 65, the set of promoted participants does not change.

If the wording implies that the definition of promoted/non-promoted is applied after the increase, then the passmark is still 65.
Score after increase $\ge 65$.
$x_i + 5 \ge 65 \implies x_i \ge 60$.

This is not consistent with the problem statement as the averages of "the promoted" and "the non-promoted" are given after the increase. This implies the classification is done based on the new scores relative to the passmark.

Let's assume the passmark remains at 65, and the averages are recalculated with the increased scores.
Average of all after increase = $66 + 5 = 71$.
Average of initially promoted after increase = $71 + 5 = 76$.
Average of initially repeaters after increase = $56 + 5 = 61$.
This does not match the given values of 75 and 59.

The phrasing "At this point the average of the promoted participants becomes 75" suggests that the classification of promoted is done after the increase.

Passmark = 65.
Scores after increase: $x_i + 5$.
Promoted after increase: $x_i + 5 \ge 65 \implies x_i \ge 60$.
Non-promoted after increase: $x_i + 5 < 65 \implies x_i < 60$.

Let $P'$ be the number of participants with original score $\ge 60$.
Let $R'$ be the number of participants with original score $< 60$.
$P' + R' = N$.

Average of promoted after increase = 75.
$\frac{\sum_{x_i \ge 60} (x_i + 5)}{P'} = 75$.
$\frac{\sum_{x_i \ge 60} x_i + 5P'}{P'} = 75$.
$\frac{\sum_{x_i \ge 60} x_i}{P'} + 5 = 75$.
Average of original scores of those $\ge 60$ is $70$.

Average of non-promoted after increase = 59.
$\frac{\sum_{x_i < 60} (x_i + 5)}{R'} = 59$.
$\frac{\sum_{x_i < 60} x_i + 5R'}{R'} = 59$.
$\frac{\sum_{x_i < 60} x_i}{R'} + 5 = 59$.
Average of original scores of those $< 60$ is $54$.

This interpretation leads to different groupings before and after the increase.

Let's stick to the idea that the definition of promoted/non-promoted is based on the score at that time relative to the passmark of 65.

Initial state:
Promoted (score $\ge 65$): Number $P$, average $71$.
Repeaters (score $< 65$): Number $R$, average $56$.

After increase: new score = original score + 5.
Passmark = 65.
Promoted (new score $\ge 65$): original score $+ 5 \ge 65 \implies$ original score $\ge 60$.
Non-promoted (new score $< 65$): original score $+ 5 < 65 \implies$ original score $< 60$.

Let the set of participants with original score $\ge 65$ be $A$. $|A| = P$.
Let the set of participants with original score $< 65$ be $B$. $|B| = R$.

Let the set of participants with original score $\ge 60$ be $C$.
Let the set of participants with original score $< 60$ be $D$.

The "promoted participants" after the increase are those whose increased score is $\ge 65$, which means original score $\ge 60$. This is set $C$.
The "non-promoted" after the increase are those whose increased score is $< 65$, which means original score $< 60$. This is set $D$.

Average of all participants initially = 66.
Sum of scores initially = $66N$.

Sum of promoted initially = $71P$.
Sum of repeaters initially = $56R$.
$71P + 56R = 66N = 66(P+R)$.
$71P + 56R = 66P + 66R$.
$5P = 10R$.
$P = 2R$.

Average of promoted after increase = 75.
The promoted after increase are those with original score $\ge 60$.
Let the number of such participants be $P'$.
Sum of their increased scores / $P'$ = 75.
Sum of (original score + 5) for those $\ge 60$ / $P'$ = 75.
(Sum of original score for those $\ge 60$ + $5P'$) / $P'$ = 75.
Avg of original score for those $\ge 60$ + 5 = 75.
Avg of original score for those $\ge 60$ = 70.

Average of non-promoted after increase = 59.
The non-promoted after increase are those with original score $< 60$.
Let the number of such participants be $R'$.
Avg of original score for those $< 60$ = 54.

Let the set of original scores be divided into two groups based on 60 and 65.
Group 1: score $\ge 65$. Number $P$, avg 71.
Group 2: $60 \le$ score $< 65$. Number $x$, avg $y$.
Group 3: score $< 60$. Number $R'$, avg 54.

Promoted after increase: scores $\ge 60$. These are the participants in Group 1 and Group 2.
Number of promoted after increase = $P + x$.
Average of original scores of these = 70.
$\frac{71P \times P + y \times x}{P+x} = 70$. This is wrong.

Sum of original scores $\ge 60 = 71P + \text{sum of scores in Group 2}$.
Number of participants with original score $\ge 60 = P + x$.
Average of original scores $\ge 60 = \frac{71P + \text{sum of scores in Group 2}}{P+x} = 70$.
$71P + \text{sum of scores in Group 2} = 70(P+x) = 70P + 70x$.
Sum of scores in Group 2 = $70x - P$.
Average of scores in Group 2 = $(70x - P)/x = y$.

Non-promoted after increase: scores $< 60$. These are the participants in Group 3.
Number $= R'$. Average of original scores = 54.

We have $P = 2R$.
$N = P + R = 2R + R = 3R$.
$N < 40 \implies 3R < 40 \implies R \le 13$.
Possible values of $R$: 1, 2, ..., 13.
Possible values of $P$: 2, 4, ..., 26.
Possible values of $N$: 3, 6, ..., 39.

Part (a):
Let the number of participants with original score $\ge 60$ be $N_1$, and their average original score be $A_1$.
Let the number of participants with original score $< 60$ be $N_2$, and their average original score be $A_2$.
$N_1 + N_2 = N$.
$N_1 = P'$ and $N_2 = R'$.
We found $A_1 = 70$ and $A_2 = 54$.

The overall average is 66.
$N_1 A_1 + N_2 A_2 = 66N$.
$70 N_1 + 54 N_2 = 66 (N_1 + N_2)$.
$70 N_1 + 54 N_2 = 66 N_1 + 66 N_2$.
$4 N_1 = 12 N_2$.
$N_1 = 3 N_2$.

The participants with original score $\ge 65$ have average 71.
The participants with original score $< 65$ have average 56.
Let the number with score $\ge 65$ be $P$, number with score $< 65$ be $R$.
$71P + 56R = 66(P+R) \implies P = 2R$.

The participants with original score $\ge 60$ have number $N_1$.
The participants with original score $< 60$ have number $N_2$.
$N_1 = P + (\text{number with score } 60 \le \text{score} < 65)$.
$N_2 = R - (\text{number with score } 60 \le \text{score} < 65)$.

$N_1 = 3 N_2$.
$P + x = 3 (R - x)$, where $x$ is number with score $60 \le \text{score} < 65$.
$2R + x = 3 (R - x) = 3R - 3x$.
$4x = R$.

$N = P + R = 2R + R = 3R$.
$R = 4x$.
$N = 3(4x) = 12x$.
$N < 40 \implies 12x < 40 \implies x \le 3$.
Possible values of $x$: 1, 2, 3.
Possible values of $N$: 12, 24, 36.

Part (b):
New average of promoted = 79.
New average of non-promoted = 47.
Average of original scores of those $\ge 60 = 79 - 5 = 74$.
Average of original scores of those $< 60 = 47 - 5 = 42$.

$74 N_1 + 42 N_2 = 66 (N_1 + N_2)$.
$74 N_1 + 42 N_2 = 66 N_1 + 66 N_2$.
$8 N_1 = 24 N_2$.
$N_1 = 3 N_2$. Same relation.
Possible values of $N$: 12, 24, 36.

<text>Average of all participants initially = 66.
Sum of scores initially = $66N$.

Sum of promoted initially = $71P$.
Sum of repeaters initially = $56R$.
$71P + 56R = 66N = 66(P+R)$.
$71P + 56R = 66P + 66R$.
$5P = 10R$.
$P = 2R$.</text>
<explanation>The solver derives a constraint (P = 2R) by analyzing the relationship between the averages and counts. This constraint significantly narrows the possible values of P and R.</explanation>

<start>6683</start>
<end>6877</end>
<text>$P + x = 3 (R - x)$, where $x$ is number with score $60 \le \text{score} < 65$.
$2R + x = 3 (R - x) = 3R - 3x$.
$4x = R$.

$N = P + R = 2R + R = 3R$.
$R = 4x$.
$N = 3(4x) = 12x$.</text>
<explanation>The solver combines multiple constraints to derive a relationship between N and x. This analysis reveals that N must be a multiple of 12, which drastically limits the possible values of N given the constraint N < 40.</explanation>

<start>6877</start>
<end>6980</end>
<text>$N < 40 \implies 12x < 40 \implies x \le 3$.
Possible values of $x$: 1, 2, 3.
Possible values of $N$: 12, 24, 36.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the constraint N < 40 to determine the possible values of x, and consequently N. This final step of constraint analysis produces the answer to part (a) of the problem.</explanation>

<text>Part (b):
New average of promoted = 79.
New average of non-promoted = 47.
Average of original scores of those $\ge 60 = 79 - 5 = 74$.
Average of original scores of those $< 60 = 47 - 5 = 42$.

$74 N_1 + 42 N_2 = 66 (N_1 + N_2)$.
$74 N_1 + 42 N_2 = 66 N_1 + 66 N_2$.
$8 N_1 = 24 N_2$.
$N_1 = 3 N_2$. Same relation.</text>
<explanation>The solver systematically applies the same analysis approach to part (b) with different average values. They methodically work through the calculations to verify whether the same constraint (N₁ = 3N₂) still holds with the new conditions, confirming that the possible values of N remain the same.</explanation>

SUMMARY_START
The most important cognitive skills demonstrated in this solution are:

1. Problem Reinterpretation - The solver's ability to reconsider the meaning of "promoted" and "non-promoted" after the score increase was crucial to resolving contradictions and making progress.

2. Mathematical Modeling of Complex Scenarios - The solver created sophisticated models using sets and groups to represent how participant classifications changed after the score increase.

3. Hypothesis Testing and Revision - The solver repeatedly formulated hypotheses about problem interpretations, tested them against given information, and revised when contradictions appeared.

4. Constraint Analysis - The solver derived and combined multiple constraints to narrow down possible values of N, ultimately finding that N must be a multiple of 12 less than 40.

5. Algebraic Manipulation - The solver's systematic transformation of equations allowed them to derive key relationships between variables that led to the solution.
