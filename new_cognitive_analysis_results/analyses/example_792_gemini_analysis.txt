Problem:
Alice is sitting in a teacup ride with infinitely many layers of spinning disks. The largest disk has radius 5. Each succeeding disk has its center attached to a point on the circumference of the previous disk and has a radius equal to $2 / 3$ of the previous disk. Each disk spins around its center (relative to the disk it is attached to) at a rate of \pi / 6$ radians per second. Initially, at $t=0$, the centers of the disks are aligned on a single line, going outward. Alice is sitting at the limit point of all these disks. After 12 seconds, what is the length of the trajectory that Alice has traced out?

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem describes a system of infinitely many rotating disks, where each disk is attached to the circumference of the previous one. We need to find the trajectory of a point (Alice) located at the limit point of this system.

Let the disks be numbered $D_0, D_1, D_2, \ldots$, where $D_0$ is the largest disk.
The radius of disk $D_n$ is $r_n$.
The radius of $D_0$ is $r_0 = 5$.
The radius of $D_n$ is given by $r_n = (2/3)^n r_0 = 5 (2/3)^n$.

The center of disk $D_n$ is $C_n$.
The center of $D_0$ is at the origin, $C_0 = (0, 0)$.
The center of $D_1$ is on the circumference of $D_0$. Initially, the centers are aligned on a single line. Let this line be the positive x-axis.
Initial position of $C_1$: $(r_0, 0) = (5, 0)$.
Initial position of $C_2$: $(r_0 + r_1, 0) = (5 + 5(2/3), 0)$.
Initial position of $C_n$: $\left( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} r_i, 0 \right) = \left( 5 \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (2/3)^i, 0 \right)$.

The rotation rate of each disk relative to the disk it is attached to is $\omega = \pi / 6$ rad/s.

Consider the position of a point on the circumference of a rotating disk.
Disk $D_0$ rotates around $C_0$.
Disk $D_1$ rotates around $C_1$.
Disk $D_2$ rotates around $C_2$, which itself is moving due to the rotation of $D_1$.

Let the position of Alice at time $t$ be $P(t)$. Alice is at the limit point of the centers of the disks.

The position of the center of disk $D_n$ can be described recursively.
Position of $C_0(t) = (0, 0)$.
Position of $C_1(t)$: The center $C_1$ moves relative to $C_0$. The vector from $C_0$ to $C_1$ has length $r_0$. The angle of this vector changes due to the rotation of $D_0$.
Angle of $D_0$ at time $t$: $\theta_0(t) = \omega t = (\pi / 6) t$.
Position of $C_1(t) = C_0 + r_0 (\cos(\theta_0(t)), \sin(\theta_0(t))) = 5 (\cos((\pi / 6) t), \sin((\pi / 6) t))$.

Position of $C_2(t)$: The center $C_2$ moves relative to $C_1$. The vector from $C_1$ to $C_2$ has length $r_1$. The angle of this vector changes due to the rotation of $D_1$.
Angle of $D_1$ at time $t$: $\theta_1(t) = \omega t = (\pi / 6) t$. This is the rotation relative to the orientation of the line connecting $C_0$ and $C_1$.
The orientation of the line connecting $C_0$ and $C_1$ is given by $\theta_0(t)$.
The absolute angle of the vector from $C_1$ to $C_2$ is $\theta_0(t) + \theta_1(t)$.
Vector $C_1 C_2(t) = r_1 (\cos(\theta_0(t) + \theta_1(t)), \sin(\theta_0(t) + \theta_1(t)))$.
Position of $C_2(t) = C_1(t) + C_1 C_2(t)$
$C_2(t) = 5 (\cos((\pi / 6) t), \sin((\pi / 6) t)) + 5(2/3) (\cos((\pi / 6) t + (\pi / 6) t), \sin((\pi / 6) t + (\pi / 6) t))$
$C_2(t) = 5 (\cos(\omega t), \sin(\omega t)) + 5(2/3) (\cos(2 \omega t), \sin(2 \omega t))$.

Generalizing, the vector from $C_{n-1}$ to $C_n$ at time $t$:
Angle of the vector $C_{n-1} C_n$: $\theta_0(t) + \theta_1(t) + \ldots + \theta_{n-1}(t) = n \omega t$.
Vector $C_{n-1} C_n(t) = r_{n-1} (\cos(n \omega t), \sin(n \omega t))$.

Position of the center $C_n(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \vec{C_i C_{i+1}}(t)$, where $C_0 = (0, 0)$.
Position of $C_n(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} r_i (\cos((i+1) \omega t), \sin((i+1) \omega t))$.
$r_i = 5 (2/3)^i$.
Position of $C_n(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 5 (2/3)^i (\cos((i+1) \omega t), \sin((i+1) \omega t))$.

The position of Alice is the limit point of the centers of the disks.
Position of Alice $P(t) = \lim_{n \to \infty} C_n(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} 5 (2/3)^i (\cos((i+1) \omega t), \sin((i+1) \omega t))$.
Let $j = i+1$.
$P(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} 5 (2/3)^{j-1} (\cos(j \omega t), \sin(j \omega t))$.

This is a sum of vectors.
Consider the complex representation:
$z(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} 5 (2/3)^{j-1} e^{i j \omega t} = 5 \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} (2/3)^{j-1} (e^{i \omega t})^j$.
Let $x = e^{i \omega t}$. The sum is a geometric series: $\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} (2/3)^{j-1} x^j = x \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} (2/3)^{j-1} x^{j-1} = x \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} ((2/3) x)^k$.
The series converges if $|(2/3) x| < 1$, i.e., $|(2/3) e^{i \omega t}| = 2/3 < 1$.
Sum $= x / (1 - (2/3) x) = e^{i \omega t} / (1 - (2/3) e^{i \omega t})$.

$z(t) = 5 \frac{e^{i \omega t}}{1 - (2/3) e^{i \omega t}} = 5 \frac{\cos(\omega t) + i \sin(\omega t)}{1 - (2/3) (\cos(\omega t) + i \sin(\omega t))}$
$z(t) = 5 \frac{\cos(\omega t) + i \sin(\omega t)}{(1 - (2/3) \cos(\omega t)) - i (2/3) \sin(\omega t)}$
Multiply by the conjugate of the denominator: $(1 - (2/3) \cos(\omega t)) + i (2/3) \sin(\omega t)$.
Denominator: $(1 - (2/3) \cos(\omega t))^2 + (2/3)^2 \sin^2(\omega t)$
$= 1 - (4/3) \cos(\omega t) + (4/9) \cos^2(\omega t) + (4/9) \sin^2(\omega t)$
$= 1 - (4/3) \cos(\omega t) + 4/9$.

Numerator:
$(\cos(\omega t) + i \sin(\omega t)) ((1 - (2/3) \cos(\omega t)) + i (2/3) \sin(\omega t))$
$= \cos(\omega t) (1 - (2/3) \cos(\omega t)) - \sin(\omega t) (2/3) \sin(\omega t)$
$+ i (\sin(\omega t) (1 - (2/3) \cos(\omega t)) + \cos(\omega t) (2/3) \sin(\omega t))$
Real part: $\cos(\omega t) - (2/3) \cos^2(\omega t) - (2/3) \sin^2(\omega t) = \cos(\omega t) - 2/3$.
Imaginary part: $\sin(\omega t) - (2/3) \sin(\omega t) \cos(\omega t) + (2/3) \cos(\omega t) \sin(\omega t) = \sin(\omega t)$.

$z(t) = 5 \frac{(\cos(\omega t) - 2/3) + i \sin(\omega t)}{1 - (4/3) \cos(\omega t) + 4/9} = 5 \frac{(\cos(\omega t) - 2/3) + i \sin(\omega t)}{13/9 - (4/3) \cos(\omega t)}$
$z(t) = 5 \frac{9 (\cos(\omega t) - 2/3) + i 9 \sin(\omega t)}{13 - 12 \cos(\omega t)}$
$z(t) = \frac{45 (\cos(\omega t) - 2/3) + i 45 \sin(\omega t)}{13 - 12 \cos(\omega t)}$
$z(t) = \frac{45 \cos(\omega t) - 30}{13 - 12 \cos(\omega t)} + i \frac{45 \sin(\omega t)}{13 - 12 \cos(\omega t)}$.

Position of Alice $(x(t), y(t))$:
$x(t) = \frac{45 \cos(\omega t) - 30}{13 - 12 \cos(\omega t)}$
$y(t) = \frac{45 \sin(\omega t)}{13 - 12 \cos(\omega t)}$

We need to find the length of the trajectory from $t=0$ to $t=12$ seconds.
Length of trajectory = $\int_0^{12} \sqrt{(\frac{dx}{dt})^2 + (\frac{dy}{dt})^2} dt$.

$\omega = \pi / 6$.

Let's calculate the derivatives.
Let $u = \omega t$.
$x(t) = \frac{45 \cos(u) - 30}{13 - 12 \cos(u)}$, $y(t) = \frac{45 \sin(u)}{13 - 12 \cos(u)}$.

$\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{dx}{du} \frac{du}{dt} = \omega \frac{dx}{du}$.
$\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dy}{du} \frac{du}{dt} = \omega \frac{dy}{du}$.

$\frac{dx}{du} = \frac{-45 \sin(u) (13 - 12 \cos(u)) - (45 \cos(u) - 30) (12 \sin(u))}{(13 - 12 \cos(u))^2}$
$= \frac{-585 \sin(u) + 540 \sin(u) \cos(u) - 540 \sin(u) \cos(u) + 360 \sin(u)}{(13 - 12 \cos(u))^2}$
$= \frac{(-585 + 360) \sin(u)}{(13 - 12 \cos(u))^2} = \frac{-225 \sin(u)}{(13 - 12 \cos(u))^2}$.

$\frac{dy}{du} = \frac{45 \cos(u) (13 - 12 \cos(u)) - 45 \sin(u) (12 \sin(u))}{(13 - 12 \cos(u))^2}$
$= \frac{585 \cos(u) - 540 \cos^2(u) - 540 \sin^2(u)}{(13 - 12 \cos(u))^2}$
$= \frac{585 \cos(u) - 540}{(13 - 12 \cos(u))^2}$.

$(\frac{dx}{dt})^2 + (\frac{dy}{dt})^2 = \omega^2 ( (\frac{dx}{du})^2 + (\frac{dy}{du})^2 )$
$= \omega^2 \frac{(-225 \sin(u))^2 + (585 \cos(u) - 540)^2}{(13 - 12 \cos(u))^4}$
Numerator:
$225^2 \sin^2(u) + (585 \cos(u) - 540)^2$
$= 50625 \sin^2(u) + 585^2 \cos^2(u) - 2 \cdot 585 \cdot 540 \cos(u) + 540^2$
$= 50625 \sin^2(u) + 342225 \cos^2(u) - 631800 \cos(u) + 291600$
$= 50625 \sin^2(u) + 342225 \cos^2(u) - 631800 \cos(u) + 291600$.

Consider the case where the disks do not spin. The centers lie on a line.
The position of Alice is at the end of the chain of segments.
Total length of the chain $= \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} r_i = 5 \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (2/3)^i = 5 \frac{1}{1 - 2/3} = 5 \frac{1}{1/3} = 15$.
Initial position of Alice at $t=0$: $(15, 0)$.
Check the formula for $x(0)$: $\omega t = 0$.
$x(0) = \frac{45 \cos(0) - 30}{13 - 12 \cos(0)} = \frac{45 - 30}{13 - 12} = \frac{15}{1} = 15$.
$y(0) = \frac{45 \sin(0)}{13 - 12 \cos(0)} = 0$.

Let's simplify the expression for $(\frac{dx}{du})^2 + (\frac{dy}{du})^2$.
Numerator $= 50625 (1 - \cos^2(u)) + 342225 \cos^2(u) - 631800 \cos(u) + 291600$
$= 50625 - 50625 \cos^2(u) + 342225 \cos^2(u) - 631800 \cos(u) + 291600$
$= 291600 + 50625 + (342225 - 50625) \cos^2(u) - 631800 \cos(u)$
$= 342225 + 291600 \cos^2(u) - 631800 \cos(u)$.

Seems complicated. Let's rethink the problem.

Consider the velocity of Alice.
The velocity of a point on disk $D_n$ relative to its center is $v_n = r_n \omega$.
The velocity of the center of disk $D_n$ is related to the rotation of the previous disks.

Velocity of $C_1$: $\vec{v}_{C_1} = \frac{d}{dt} C_1(t) = 5 \omega (-\sin(\omega t), \cos(\omega t))$.
Magnitude $|\vec{v}_{C_1}| = 5 \omega$.

Velocity of Alice is the sum of the velocities due to each rotation.
The velocity contribution from disk $D_j$ is a rotation of radius $r_j$ at rate $\omega$.

Consider the motion in the complex plane.
Velocity $\frac{dz}{dt} = i \omega \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} 5 (2/3)^{j-1} j e^{i j \omega t}$.

Consider the motion of a point at the edge of the disks.
Point on $D_0$: $5 e^{i \omega t}$. Velocity $5 i \omega e^{i \omega t}$.
Point on $D_1$ relative to its center: $r_1 e^{i \omega t}$.
Position of a point on $D_1$: $C_1(t) + r_1 e^{i (\omega t + \theta_0(t))} = 5 e^{i \omega t} + 5 (2/3) e^{i 2 \omega t}$.

The velocity of Alice is the velocity of the limit point.
Consider the relative motion.
Alice is at the limit point. Her velocity is determined by the rotation of all the disks.

Imagine the disks are gears. The angular velocity of each disk is $\omega$.
The velocity of a point on the circumference of $D_n$ relative to its center is $r_n \omega$.

Consider the velocity of Alice as the sum of tangential velocities.
The velocity contribution from disk $D_j$ is due to its rotation.
The distance of Alice from the center of disk $D_j$ is effectively $r_j$.
Magnitude of velocity contribution from $D_j$: $r_j \omega$.

The directions of these velocity contributions need to be considered.

Consider the motion in the frame of the center of $D_{n-1}$.
Disk $D_n$ rotates around its center $C_n$ with angular velocity $\omega$.
The center $C_n$ rotates around $C_{n-1}$.

Let's use the formula for the speed: $|dz/dt|$.
$\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( 5 \frac{e^{i \omega t}}{1 - (2/3) e^{i \omega t}} \right)$.
Let $w = e^{i \omega t}$. $\frac{dw}{dt} = i \omega e^{i \omega t}$.
$\frac{dz}{dt} = 5 \frac{i \omega e^{i \omega t} (1 - (2/3) e^{i \omega t}) - e^{i \omega t} (-(2/3) i \omega e^{i \omega t})}{(1 - (2/3) e^{i \omega t})^2}$
$= 5 i \omega \frac{e^{i \omega t} - (2/3) e^{i 2 \omega t} + (2/3) e^{i 2 \omega t}}{(1 - (2/3) e^{i \omega t})^2}$
$= 5 i \omega \frac{e^{i \omega t}}{(1 - (2/3) e^{i \omega t})^2}$.

Magnitude of velocity: $| \frac{dz}{dt} | = 5 \omega \frac{|e^{i \omega t}|}{|1 - (2/3) e^{i \omega t}|^2}$
$= 5 \omega \frac{1}{|1 - (2/3) (\cos(\omega t) + i \sin(\omega t))|^2}$
$= 5 \omega \frac{1}{|(1 - (2/3) \cos(\omega t)) - i (2/3) \sin(\omega t)|^2}$
$= 5 \omega \frac{1}{(1 - (2/3) \cos(\omega t))^2 + (2/3)^2 \sin^2(\omega t)}$
$= 5 \omega \frac{1}{1 - (4/3) \cos(\omega t) + (4/9) \cos^2(\omega t) + (4/9) \sin^2(\omega t)}$
$= 5 \omega \frac{1}{1 - (4/3) \cos(\omega t) + 4/9}$
$= 5 \omega \frac{1}{13/9 - (4/3) \cos(\omega t)} = 5 \omega \frac{9}{13 - 12 \cos(\omega t)}$.

Speed $= \frac{45 \omega}{13 - 12 \cos(\omega t)}$.
Length of trajectory = $\int_0^{12} \frac{45 \omega}{13 - 12 \cos(\omega t)} dt$.
$\omega = \pi / 6$.
Length $= \int_0^{12} \frac{45 (\pi / 6)}{13 - 12 \cos((\pi / 6) t)} dt$.
Let $u = (\pi / 6) t$. $du = (\pi / 6) dt$.
When $t=0, u=0$. When $t=12, u = 2 \pi$.
Length $= \int_0^{2 \pi} \frac{45 (\pi / 6)}{13 - 12 \cos(u)} \frac{6}{\pi} du = \int_0^{2 \pi} \frac{45}{13 - 12 \cos(u)} du$.

Integral of the form $\int_0^{2 \pi} \frac{d \theta}{a + b \cos \theta}$.
Here $a = 13, b = -12$. $a > |b|$.
The integral is $\frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}} = \frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{13^2 - (-12)^2}} = \frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{169 - 144}} = \frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{25}} = \frac{2 \pi}{5}$.

Length $= 45 \int_0^{2 \pi} \frac{du}{13 - 12 \cos(u)} = 45 \cdot \frac{2 \pi}{5} = 9 \cdot 2 \pi = 18 \pi$.

<text>$= \cos(\omega t) (1 - (2/3) \cos(\omega t)) - \sin(\omega t) (2/3) \sin(\omega t)$
$+ i (\sin(\omega t) (1 - (2/3) \cos(\omega t)) + \cos(\omega t) (2/3) \sin(\omega t))$
Real part: $\cos(\omega t) - (2/3) \cos^2(\omega t) - (2/3) \sin^2(\omega t) = \cos(\omega t) - 2/3$.

<text>Check the formula for $x(0)$: $\omega t = 0$.
$x(0) = \frac{45 \cos(0) - 30}{13 - 12 \cos(0)} = \frac{45 - 30}{13 - 12} = \frac{15}{1} = 15$.
$y(0) = \frac{45 \sin(0)}{13 - 12 \cos(0)} = 0$.</text>

<text>Let's use the formula for the speed: $|dz/dt|$.
$\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( 5 \frac{e^{i \omega t}}{1 - (2/3) e^{i \omega t}} \right)$.
Let $w = e^{i \omega t}$. $\frac{dw}{dt} = i \omega e^{i \omega t}$.
$\frac{dz}{dt} = 5 \frac{i \omega e^{i \omega t} (1 - (2/3) e^{i \omega t}) - e^{i \omega t} (-(2/3) i \omega e^{i \omega t})}{(1 - (2/3) e^{i \omega t})^2}$</text>
<explanation>The solver further simplifies their approach by focusing on calculating the speed directly from the complex position function.
