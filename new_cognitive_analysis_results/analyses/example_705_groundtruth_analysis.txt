<explanation>Although the solution is extremely concise, it represents the culmination of recognizing a pattern in the values of csc²(2k-1)° for k from 1 to 45. The solver has identified that these values, when multiplied together, yield a value that can be expressed as m^n where m and n are integers greater than 1, and m+n=91.</explanation>

<text>91</text>
<explanation>While not explicitly shown in the brief solution, reaching the answer of 91 would require applying trigonometric identities to work with csc²(2k-1)°. Specifically, the solver would need to recognize that csc²(θ) = 1/sin²(θ) and potentially use identities related to products of sine values.</explanation>

<text>91</text>
<explanation>The answer 91 suggests the solver determined that the product equals m^n where m and n are integers greater than 1 such that m+n=91. This requires factoring the result and identifying that 91 = 7 + 13, where both 7 and 13 are prime numbers, suggesting the product equals 7^13 or 13^7.</explanation>

<explanation>The concise answer indicates that the solver has simplified a complex product of 45 trigonometric terms into a power expression m^n, and then identified the specific values of m and n that satisfy the constraints.</explanation>

<explanation>Reaching the answer 91 likely involved recognizing symmetry in the values of csc²(2k-1)° for complementary angles, as the angles from 1° to 89° (odd values) have special relationships that can simplify the product calculation.</explanation>
