Problem:
In general, whenever an electric and a magnetic field are at an angle to each other, energy is transferred; for example, this principle is the reason electromagnetic radiation transfers energy. The power transferred per unit area is given by the Poynting vector:

$$
\vec{S}=\frac{1}{\mu_{0}} \vec{E} \times \vec{B}
$$

In each part of this problem, the last subpart asks you to verify that the rate of energy transfer agrees with the formula for the Poynting vector. Therefore, you should not use the formula for the Poynting vector before the last subpart!

A long, insulating cylindrical rod has radius $R$ and carries a uniform volume charge density $\rho$. A uniform external electric field $E$ exists in the direction of its axis. The rod moves in the direction of its axis at speed $v$.

Compute the Poynting vector, draw its direction on a diagram, and verify that it agrees with the rate of energy transfer.

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let's break this problem down into smaller pieces. We have a charged cylindrical rod moving in an external electric field. This will create both electric and magnetic fields. We need to calculate these fields first. Then we can determine the force on the charges and the rate of work done. Finally, we can calculate the Poynting vector and compare.

**1. Electric Field:**

*   The rod has a uniform volume charge density $\rho$.
*   There's an external uniform electric field $E$ along the axis.
*   The electric field inside the rod due to its own charge can be found using Gauss's law. Consider a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius $r < R$ and length $L$.
    *   The enclosed charge is $Q_{enc} = \rho \pi r^2 L$.
    *   The electric flux through the ends is zero.
    *   The electric flux through the curved surface is $E_{rod} 2 \pi r L$.
    *   Gauss's law: $\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}$
    *   $E_{rod} 2 \pi r L = \frac{\rho \pi r^2 L}{\epsilon_0}$
    *   $E_{rod} = \frac{\rho r}{2 \epsilon_0}$ (radially outward)
*   The total electric field inside the rod is the vector sum of the external field and the rod's own field. Since the external field is along the axis, and the rod's field is radial, they are perpendicular. However, the Poynting vector concerns the energy transfer due to the interaction of electric and magnetic fields, so we should focus on the fields at the surface of the rod for verification later. At the surface, the radial electric field is $E_{rod, surface} = \frac{\rho R}{2 \epsilon_0}$. The axial external field is $E$.

**2. Magnetic Field:**

*   The moving charged rod acts as a current. The current density $\vec{J} = \rho \vec{v}$.
*   We can use Ampere's law to find the magnetic field inside and outside the rod. Consider a circular Amperian loop of radius $r$.
    *   Inside the rod ($r < R$):
        *   The enclosed current is $I_{enc} = J \pi r^2 = \rho v \pi r^2$.
        *   Ampere's law: $\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0 I_{enc}$
        *   $B 2 \pi r = \mu_0 \rho v \pi r^2$
        *   $B_{in} = \frac{1}{2} \mu_0 \rho v r$ (tangential, using the right-hand rule, it circles in the $\hat{\phi}$ direction if the rod moves in the $\hat{z}$ direction).
    *   Outside the rod ($r > R$):
        *   The enclosed current is $I_{enc} = J \pi R^2 = \rho v \pi R^2$.
        *   $B 2 \pi r = \mu_0 \rho v \pi R^2$
        *   $B_{out} = \frac{\mu_0 \rho v R^2}{2r}$ (tangential).
*   At the surface of the rod ($r = R$), the magnetic field is $B = \frac{1}{2} \mu_0 \rho v R$.

**3. Force and Rate of Energy Transfer:**

*   Consider a small volume element $dV$ inside the rod. The charge in this volume is $dq = \rho dV$.
*   The electric force on this charge is $d\vec{F}_E = dq \vec{E}_{total} = \rho dV (\vec{E} + \vec{E}_{rod})$.
*   The magnetic force on this charge is $d\vec{F}_B = dq (\vec{v} \times \vec{B})$.
*   The rate of work done by the electric field on this volume element is $dW/dt = \vec{F}_E \cdot \vec{v} = \rho dV (\vec{E} + \vec{E}_{rod}) \cdot \vec{v}$.
*   Since the rod moves along its axis, $\vec{v}$ is in the axial direction. The radial electric field $\vec{E}_{rod}$ is perpendicular to $\vec{v}$, so $\vec{E}_{rod} \cdot \vec{v} = 0$.
*   So, the rate of work done on the volume element is $dW/dt = \rho dV \vec{E} \cdot \vec{v}$.
*   The rate of energy transfer per unit volume is $\frac{dP}{dV} = \rho \vec{E} \cdot \vec{v}$.

**4. Poynting Vector Calculation:**

*   We need to calculate the Poynting vector at the surface of the rod.
*   The electric field at the surface has two components: $\vec{E}_{radial} = \frac{\rho R}{2 \epsilon_0} \hat{r}$ and $\vec{E}_{axial} = E \hat{z}$.
*   The magnetic field at the surface is $\vec{B} = \frac{1}{2} \mu_0 \rho v R \hat{\phi}$.
*   The Poynting vector $\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \vec{E} \times \vec{B}$.
*   $\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left( \frac{\rho R}{2 \epsilon_0} \hat{r} + E \hat{z} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \mu_0 \rho v R \hat{\phi} \right)$
*   $\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left( \frac{\rho R}{2 \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{2} \mu_0 \rho v R (\hat{r} \times \hat{\phi}) + E \frac{1}{2} \mu_0 \rho v R (\hat{z} \times \hat{\phi}) \right)$
*   $\vec{S} = \frac{1}{4} \frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0} \rho^2 v R^2 \hat{z} + \frac{1}{2} E \rho v R (-\hat{r})$
*   $\vec{S} = \frac{1}{4} c^2 \mu_0^2 \rho^2 v R^2 \hat{z} - \frac{1}{2} E \rho v R \hat{r}$  (using $c^2 = 1/\mu_0 \epsilon_0$)

**Revisiting the rate of energy transfer:**

We need to consider the work done by the fields on the charges that are crossing a surface. Consider a small section of the rod of length $dl$. The force on the charges in this section is due to the total electric field. The rate of work done by the electric field is $\vec{F} \cdot \vec{v}$.

Let's consider the energy flow out of the volume of the rod. The Poynting vector describes the energy flux. We need to integrate $\vec{S} \cdot d\vec{A}$ over the surface.

Consider the surface of the rod. The area vector is $d\vec{A} = R d\phi dz \hat{r}$ for the curved surface.
The rate of energy transfer through the curved surface is $\oint \vec{S} \cdot d\vec{A} = \int_0^L \int_0^{2\pi} \left( \frac{1}{4} \frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0} \rho^2 v R^2 \hat{z} - \frac{1}{2} E \rho v R \hat{r} \right) \cdot (R d\phi dz \hat{r})$.
$\oint \vec{S} \cdot d\vec{A} = \int_0^L \int_0^{2\pi} - \frac{1}{2} E \rho v R^2 d\phi dz = - \frac{1}{2} E \rho v R^2 (2\pi) L = - \pi R^2 L \rho v E$.

Let's consider the forces on the charges in the rod. The electric force per unit volume is $\vec{f}_e = \rho \vec{E}_{total} = \rho (\vec{E} + \vec{E}_{rod})$. The rate of work done by this force per unit volume is $\vec{f}_e \cdot \vec{v} = \rho (\vec{E} + \vec{E}_{rod}) \cdot \vec{v} = \rho \vec{E} \cdot \vec{v}$ (since $\vec{E}_{rod} \perp \vec{v}$). The total rate of work done on the rod of length $L$ is $\int_V \rho \vec{E} \cdot \vec{v} dV = \int_0^L \int_0^R \int_0^{2\pi} \rho E v \cos(0) r dr d\phi dz = \rho E v (\pi R^2) L$.

The rate of energy transfer should correspond to the work done by the external electric field to push the charged rod. The force on the rod due to the external field is $Q E = (\rho \pi R^2 L) E$. The rate of work done by this force is $F v = (\rho \pi R^2 L) E v$.

**Let's rethink the fields and forces carefully near the surface.**

*   **Electric Field:**  At the surface, we have the external field $\vec{E}$ along the axis. There's also the radial field due to the rod's charge, but for energy transfer related to the external work, we primarily focus on the external field's interaction with the induced magnetic field.
*   **Magnetic Field:** The magnetic field at the surface is tangential.

Consider the frame of reference of the rod. In this frame, there is no magnetic force. The external electric field exerts a force on the charges.

Let's consider the energy flow using the Poynting vector related to the external field and the magnetic field produced by the moving charge.

*   External Electric Field: $\vec{E} = E \hat{z}$
*   Magnetic Field due to the moving charge: $\vec{B} = \frac{1}{2} \mu_0 \rho v R \hat{\phi}$ at the surface.

Poynting vector due to these fields:
$\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \vec{E} \times \vec{B} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} (E \hat{z}) \times (\frac{1}{2} \mu_0 \rho v R \hat{\phi}) = \frac{1}{2} E \rho v R (\hat{z} \times \hat{\phi}) = - \frac{1}{2} E \rho v R \hat{r}$.

The power flow through the surface of the rod is $\oint \vec{S} \cdot d\vec{A} = \int_0^L \int_0^{2\pi} (-\frac{1}{2} E \rho v R \hat{r}) \cdot (R d\phi dz \hat{r}) = -\frac{1}{2} E \rho v R^2 \int_0^L \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi dz = -\frac{1}{2} E \rho v R^2 (2\pi L) = - \pi R^2 L \rho v E$.

The negative sign indicates that the energy is flowing *into* the rod.

Now let's consider the rate of work done by the external electric field on the charges in the rod.
The force on the charges in a volume $dV$ is $dq \vec{E} = \rho dV \vec{E}$.
The rate of work done by the external field on these charges is $dW/dt = (\rho dV \vec{E}) \cdot \vec{v} = \rho dV (\vec{E} \cdot \vec{v})$.
Since $\vec{E}$ is along the axis and $\vec{v}$ is along the axis, $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{v} = E v$.
The total rate of work done on the rod is $\int_V \rho E v dV = \rho E v \int_V dV = \rho E v (\pi R^2 L)$.

This is the rate at which the external electric field does work on the rod. The energy flows into the rod.

**Drawing the Poynting vector:**

The Poynting vector $\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \vec{E} \times \vec{B}$.
At the surface, $\vec{E}$ is approximately along the axis (assuming the external field dominates for this analysis). Let's say the axis is the $z$-axis, so $\vec{E} \approx E \hat{z}$.
The magnetic field due to the moving charge is tangential, circling around the axis. If the charge is positive and moving in the $+z$ direction, the magnetic field is in the $\hat{\phi}$ direction.
$\vec{S} \propto \hat{z} \times \hat{\phi} = -\hat{r}$.
The Poynting vector points radially inward.

**Verification:**

The rate of energy transfer into the rod calculated from the Poynting vector is $-\oint \vec{S} \cdot d\vec{A} = - (-\pi R^2 L \rho v E) = \pi R^2 L \rho v E$.
The rate of work done by the external electric field on the moving charges in the rod is $\int_V \vec{J} \cdot \vec{E} dV = \int_V (\rho \vec{v}) \cdot \vec{E} dV = \int_V \rho v E dV = \rho v E (\pi R^2 L)$.

The rate of energy transfer calculated by integrating the Poynting vector over the surface matches the rate of work done by the external electric field.

**Final check of the assumptions:**

*   We assumed the external electric field is the dominant factor for the Poynting vector calculation for energy transfer related to external work. The self-fields of the rod contribute to internal energy and momentum.
*   The problem asks to verify the agreement with the rate of energy transfer, implying we need to relate the Poynting vector to the work done by the fields.

**Summary of the fields at the surface:**

*   Electric field: Primarily the external field $\vec{E} = E \hat{z}$. The radial field due to the rod's charge exists, but its interaction with the magnetic field leads to a Poynting vector along the axis.
*   Magnetic field: $\vec{B} = \frac{1}{2} \mu_0 \rho v R \hat{\phi}$.

**Poynting vector:**
$\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} (E \hat{z}) \times (\frac{1}{2} \mu_0 \rho v R \hat{\phi}) = -\frac{1}{2} E \rho v R \hat{r}$.

**Rate of energy transfer (Poynting vector):**
$\oint \vec{S} \cdot d\vec{A} = \int (-\frac{1}{2} E \rho v R \hat{r}) \cdot (R d\phi dz \hat{r}) = -\pi R^2 L \rho v E$. (Energy flows in).

**Rate of energy transfer (work done):**
The external electric field does work on the moving charges. The force on the charges is $\rho dV \vec{E}$. The rate of work is $\int (\rho \vec{v}) \cdot \vec{E} dV = \rho v E \pi R^2 L$.

The power delivered by the external field matches the energy flux calculated by the Poynting vector (with a sign convention for inflow/outflow).
