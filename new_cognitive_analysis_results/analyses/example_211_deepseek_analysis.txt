Problem:
(d) The one-dimensional diffusion equation (also called the "heat equation") is given (for a free particle) by

$$
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=a \frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial x^{2}}
\tag{5}
$$

A spatial wave can be written as $\sim e^{i k x}$ (larger $k$ 's correspond to waves oscillating on smaller length scales). Guessing a solution $\psi(x, t)=A e^{i k x-i \omega t}$, find $\omega$ in terms of k. A relationship of this time is called a "dispersion relation."

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, let me try to work through this problem. I need to find the dispersion relation for the one-dimensional diffusion equation, which is given by:

∂ψ/∂t = a ∂2ψ/∂x2

The problem says to guess a solution of the form ψ(x, t) = A e^{i k x - i ω t}, and then find ω in terms of k. Alright, so this is a partial differential equation, and they want a plane wave solution. 

First, let me recall that when dealing with such equations, substituting a trial solution like a plane wave is a common method. The idea is to plug the guess into the equation and see what ω has to be for the equation to hold true. That will give us the relationship between ω and k, which is the dispersion relation.

So, let's take the given ψ(x, t) = A e^{i k x - i ω t}. Here, A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, and ω is the angular frequency. 

The next step is to compute the partial derivatives ∂ψ/∂t and ∂2ψ/∂x2, then substitute them into the diffusion equation.

Starting with the time derivative, ∂ψ/∂t. Let's differentiate ψ with respect to t:

∂ψ/∂t = ∂/∂t [A e^{i k x - i ω t}]

Since A is a constant and the derivative is with respect to t, the variables x is treated as a constant. The derivative of e^{something} is e^{something} times the derivative of the exponent. The exponent is (i k x - i ω t). The derivative of this exponent with respect to t is -i ω. Therefore:

∂ψ/∂t = A * (-i ω) e^{i k x - i ω t} = -i ω ψ(x, t)

Now, moving on to the spatial derivatives. The equation has the second derivative with respect to x, so let's compute ∂2ψ/∂x2. 

First, the first derivative ∂ψ/∂x:

∂ψ/∂x = ∂/∂x [A e^{i k x - i ω t}]

Here, we differentiate with respect to x, so t is constant. The derivative of the exponent (i k x - i ω t) with respect to x is i k. Therefore:

∂ψ/∂x = A * (i k) e^{i k x - i ω t} = i k ψ(x, t)

Now, take the second derivative ∂2ψ/∂x2:

∂2ψ/∂x2 = ∂/∂x [i k ψ(x, t)] = i k * ∂ψ/∂x

But from before, we know that ∂ψ/∂x = i k ψ. So substituting that in:

∂2ψ/∂x2 = i k * (i k ψ) = (i k)^2 ψ

Calculating (i k)^2: (i)^2 is -1, so this becomes:

(i k)^2 = -1 * k^2 = -k^2

Hence, the second derivative simplifies to:

∂2ψ/∂x2 = -k^2 ψ(x, t)

Now, go back to the original diffusion equation: ∂ψ/∂t = a ∂2ψ/∂x2

Substituting the computed derivatives:

Left-hand side (LHS): ∂ψ/∂t = -i ω ψ

Right-hand side (RHS): a ∂2ψ/∂x2 = a * (-k^2 ψ) = -a k^2 ψ

Setting LHS equal to RHS:

-i ω ψ = -a k^2 ψ

Since ψ is not zero (assuming A ≠ 0 and the exponential terms aren't zero), we can divide both sides by -ψ:

i ω = a k^2

Therefore, solving for ω:

ω = (a k^2) / i

Hmm, division by i. Let me remember that 1/i = -i, because i * (-i) = 1. So, 1/i = -i. Therefore:

ω = (a k^2) * (-i) = -i a k^2

Wait, so ω is purely imaginary here? That seems odd for a dispersion relation. Typically, in wave equations, ω is real, which gives propagating waves. If ω has an imaginary component, it leads to growth or decay in time. But this is the diffusion equation, which is different from the wave equation. The diffusion equation is parabolic and typically has solutions that decay over time, as opposed to hyperbolic equations like the wave equation, which support undamped waves. So, in this case, having an imaginary ω makes sense because it leads to exponential decay (if the imaginary part is negative) or growth (if positive). But here the imaginary part is negative? Let's check.

Wait, so ω = -i a k^2. That would mean the time dependence is e^{-i ω t} = e^{-i (-i a k^2) t} = e^{- (a k^2) t}, since -i * (-i a k^2 t) = -i^2 a k^2 t = -(-1) a k^2 t = a k^2 t, wait, no, hold on.

Wait the exponent in the solution ψ is -i ω t. So substituting ω as -i a k2, then we have:

-i ω t = -i (-i a k2) t = (-i)(-i) a k2 t

Calculating (-i)(-i): (-i)^2 = (-1)^2 i^2 = 1*(-1) = -1.

So, that term becomes -1 * a k2 t, so the exponent becomes - a k2 t. Therefore, the full solution is ψ = A e^{i k x} e^{- a k2 t}, which is a decaying exponential in time multiplied by a spatial oscillatory term. That does make sense for the diffusion equation. Solutions tend to spread out over time, and higher spatial frequencies (larger k) decay faster, which is consistent with the exponential term e^{- a k2 t}. So larger k (smaller length scales) decay more rapidly. 

Therefore, the imaginary ω here is leading to a damping term. So in the dispersion relation, even though we get an imaginary ω, it is correct in the context of the diffusion equation. 

But let me step back and check my algebra again to ensure I haven't made an error.

Starting from the derivatives:

Time derivative: -i ω ψ

Second space derivative: -k2 ψ

So equation says:

-i ω ψ = a (-k2 ψ)

=> -i ω = -a k2

Multiply both sides by -1:

i ω = a k2

Then, divide both sides by i:

ω = (a k2)/i = -i a k2

Yes, that's correct. So ω = -i a k2

Hence, the dispersion relation is ω = -i a k2

Therefore, written in terms of k, ω is purely imaginary. So when they ask for the dispersion relation ω in terms of k, which is what we just found: ω = -i a k2

But let me verify once more because sometimes signs can be tricky. Let me recast.

The given trial solution is ψ(x, t)=A e^{i k x - i ω t}. So the time dependence is e^{-i ω t} and we found for ω that substitution leads to exponential decay e^{-a k2 t}. So if ω = -i a k2, then substituting into e^{-i ω t} becomes:

e^{-i (-i a k2) t} = e^{- (i^2) a k2 t} = e^{- (-1) a k2 t} = e^{a k2 t}

Wait, hold on, that gives a positive exponent, which would be a growing exponential. That's not physical for the diffusion equation. Because the diffusion equation should lead to decaying solutions, right? The temperature or concentration diffuses over time, so amplitudes decrease. But this calculation is giving me a positive exponent? There must be a mistake.

Wait, so let me double-check:

We found ω = -i a k2

So -i ω t = -i * (-i a k2) t

Multiply those out: (-i)*(-i) = (-i)^2 = (-1)^2 (i)^2 = (1)(-1) = -1. So (-i)*(-i a k2) t = -1 * a k2 t. So the exponent is -a k2 t. Hence:

e^{-i ω t} = e^{-a k2 t}

So yes, ψ decays as t increases, as expected. So that part was correct. The confusion was in expanding the exponent. So, to clarify:

When we substitute ω = -i a k2 into the solution:

ψ(x, t) = A e^{i k x} e^{-i ω t} = A e^{i k x} e^{-i (-i a k2) t}

Simplify the exponent in the last term:

- i (-i a k2) t = (-i) * (-i) a k2 t = (i2) a k2 t = (-1) a k2 t = -a k2 t

Hence, ψ(x, t) = A e^{i k x} e^{-a k2 t}

Which is a decaying exponential as time increases, times the spatial wave. That's correct. So even though ω is imaginary here, the solution makes physical sense.

Therefore, the dispersion relation is ω = -i a k2

So whenever you have the diffusion equation, the dispersion relation has ω purely imaginary, indicating that the temporal behavior is non-oscillatory (exponential decay). In wave equations, ω is real, meaning oscillations in time, but here it's different because diffusion is a dissipative process. 

Therefore, summarizing the steps:

1. Assume wave solution ψ(x, t)=A e^{i k x -i ω t}
2. Calculate ∂ψ/∂t and ∂2ψ/∂x2
3. Plug into the diffusion equation
4. Equate terms and solve for ω in terms of k
5. Find that ω = -i a k2

Hence, that's the dispersion relation. 

I don't see any mistakes in the algebra, and the final result makes physical sense for the diffusion equation. So I believe this is correct.

**Final Answer**
The dispersion relation is \boxed{\omega = -i a k^2}.
