Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Objective**: We need to show that there exists a separable and metrizable topology on \( X \) that is coarser than \( \tau \).

2. **Strategy**: We aim to find countably many real-valued continuous functions on \( (X, \tau) \) that separate the points of \( X \). These functions will provide a one-to-one continuous map of \( (X, \tau) \) into a countable product of real lines. The topology on \( X \) generated by this map will be separable and metrizable.

3. **Constructing the Functions**:
    - For each \( n \ge 1 \), let \( X_n \) be a maximal family of points in \( X \) such that the distance between any two points is at least \( \frac{1}{n} \). This ensures that \( X_n \) is a discrete set in the metric space.
    - For each \( m > n \), define \( X_n^m \) as the union of the closed balls of radius \( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{m} \) centered at the points of \( X_n \). 

4. **Properties of \( X_n \) and \( X_n^m \)**:
    - The set \( X_n \) has at most the cardinality of the continuum, by the hypothesis.
    - The set \( X_n^m \) is closed for every pair \( m > n \) of positive integers.
    - Each ball of radius \( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{m} \) is an open subset of \( X_n^m \).

5. **Defining the Functions**:
    - For each \( n \) and \( m \), we can find a real-valued continuous function \( f_{n,m} \) defined on \( X_n^m \) that is constant on each ball but assigns different values to different balls. This is possible due to the Urysohn Lemma, which states that for any two disjoint closed sets in a normal space, there exists a continuous function that maps one set to 0 and the other to 1.
    - Extend \( f_{n,m} \) to a continuous real-valued function on \( X \) using the Tietze Extension Theorem, which allows the extension of continuous functions defined on a closed subset of a normal space to the entire space.

6. **Separation of Points**:
    - The functions \( f_{n,m} \) separate the points of \( X \). For any two distinct points \( x \) and \( y \) in \( X \), there exists some \( n \) and \( m \) such that \( x \) and \( y \) lie in different balls in \( X_n^m \). Hence, \( f_{n,m}(x) \neq f_{n,m}(y) \).

7. **Conclusion**:
    - The countable family of functions \( \{ f_{n,m} \} \) provides a one-to-one continuous map from \( (X, \tau) \) into a countable product of real lines \( \mathbb{R}^\omega \).
    - The topology on \( X \) induced by this map is coarser than \( \tau \), separable, and metrizable.
