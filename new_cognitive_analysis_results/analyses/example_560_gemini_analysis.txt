Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the probability that $a_1 | a_2$ and $a_2 | a_3,$ where $a_1, a_2, a_3$ are chosen independently and at random with replacement from the set of positive integer divisors of $20^9.$

First, let's find the set $S$ of positive integer divisors of $20^9.$
$20^9 = (2^2 \cdot 5)^9 = 2^{18} \cdot 5^9.$
A positive integer divisor of $20^9$ has the form $2^a \cdot 5^b,$ where $0 \le a \le 18$ and $0 \le b \le 9.$
The number of divisors is $(18+1)(9+1) = 19 \cdot 10 = 190.$
So, $|S| = 190.$

The total number of ways to choose three numbers independently and at random with replacement from $S$ is $|S|^3 = 190^3.$ This will be the denominator $n$ in the probability.

Now, we need to find the number of triples $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ such that $a_1, a_2, a_3 \in S,$ $a_1 | a_2,$ and $a_2 | a_3.$
Let $a_1 = 2^{x_1} 5^{y_1},$ $a_2 = 2^{x_2} 5^{y_2},$ $a_3 = 2^{x_3} 5^{y_3},$ where
$0 \le x_i \le 18,$ $0 \le y_i \le 9$ for $i=1, 2, 3.$

The condition $a_1 | a_2$ means $x_1 \le x_2$ and $y_1 \le y_2.$
The condition $a_2 | a_3$ means $x_2 \le x_3$ and $y_2 \le y_3.$

Combining these, we have $0 \le x_1 \le x_2 \le x_3 \le 18$ and $0 \le y_1 \le y_2 \le y_3 \le 9.$

The number of ways to choose integers $x_1, x_2, x_3$ such that $0 \le x_1 \le x_2 \le x_3 \le 18$ is the number of ways to choose 3 numbers from $\{0, 1, \ldots, 18\}$ with replacement, which is given by $\binom{18+3}{3} = \binom{21}{3}.$
$\binom{21}{3} = \frac{21 \cdot 20 \cdot 19}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 7 \cdot 10 \cdot 19 = 1330.$

The number of ways to choose integers $y_1, y_2, y_3$ such that $0 \le y_1 \le y_2 \le y_3 \le 9$ is the number of ways to choose 3 numbers from $\{0, 1, \ldots, 9\}$ with replacement, which is given by $\binom{9+3}{3} = \binom{12}{3}.$
$\binom{12}{3} = \frac{12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 2 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 = 220.$

The number of triples $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ such that $a_1 | a_2$ and $a_2 | a_3$ is the product of the number of ways to choose the exponents of 2 and the number of ways to choose the exponents of 5.
Number of favorable triples = $\binom{21}{3} \cdot \binom{12}{3} = 1330 \cdot 220.$

$1330 \cdot 220 = 133 \cdot 10 \cdot 22 \cdot 10 = 133 \cdot 22 \cdot 100.$
$133 \cdot 22 = 133 \cdot (20 + 2) = 2660 + 266 = 2926.$
Number of favorable triples = $292600.$

The total number of triples is $190^3 = (19 \cdot 10)^3 = 19^3 \cdot 10^3 = 6859 \cdot 1000 = 6859000.$

The probability is $\frac{292600}{6859000} = \frac{2926}{68590}.$
We need to simplify this fraction.

Let's try to find the prime factors of the numerator and denominator.
$2926 = 2 \cdot 1463.$
We need to check if 1463 is prime. Try dividing by small primes.
$\sqrt{1463} \approx 38.2.$ Primes up to 37 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37.
$1463 / 7 = 209.$
$209 / 11 = 19.$
So, $1463 = 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 19.$
$2926 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 19.$

Now, let's factor the denominator $68590.$
$68590 = 10 \cdot 6859.$
We need to factor $6859.$
We know $19^3 = 6859.$

So, the probability is $\frac{2 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 19}{10 \cdot 19^3} = \frac{2 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 19}{2 \cdot 5 \cdot 19 \cdot 19^2} = \frac{7 \cdot 11}{5 \cdot 19^2} = \frac{77}{5 \cdot 361} = \frac{77}{1805}.$

The probability is $\frac{77}{1805}.$
We are given that the probability is $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
$m = 77,$ $n = 1805.$

We need to check if $77$ and $1805$ are relatively prime.
$77 = 7 \cdot 11.$
$1805.$ Ends in 5, so divisible by 5. $1805 = 5 \cdot 361 = 5 \cdot 19^2.$
The prime factors of 77 are 7 and 11.
The prime factors of 1805 are 5 and 19.
So, $\gcd(77, 1805) = 1.$
The fraction is already in simplest form.

Therefore, $m = 77$ and $n = 1805.$
The problem asks for the value of $m.$

Let's double-check the calculations.

Consider the general case: divisors of $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}.$
The number of divisors is $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\cdots(e_k+1).$

Let the set of divisors be $S.$ We choose $a_1, a_2, a_3$ with replacement from $S.$
We want the probability that $a_1 | a_2 | a_3.$

Let $d(n)$ be the number of divisors of $n.$
$|S| = d(20^9) = d(2^{18} 5^9) = (18+1)(9+1) = 19 \cdot 10 = 190.$

The number of triples $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ from $S$ is $|S|^3 = 190^3.$

Consider the exponents of prime factors.
$a_1 = 2^{x_1} 5^{y_1},$ $a_2 = 2^{x_2} 5^{y_2},$ $a_3 = 2^{x_3} 5^{y_3}.$
$0 \le x_i \le 18,$ $0 \le y_i \le 9.$

$a_1 | a_2 \implies x_1 \le x_2, y_1 \le y_2.$
$a_2 | a_3 \implies x_2 \le x_3, y_2 \le y_3.$

We need the number of sequences $0 \le x_1 \le x_2 \le x_3 \le 18.$
This is equivalent to choosing 3 numbers from $\{0, 1, \ldots, 18\}$ with replacement.
Stars and bars: We have 3 choices to make from 19 options, with replacement, order doesn't matter if we are just choosing the values, but the order matters here.
Consider the gaps between the chosen numbers.
Let $z_1 = x_1 - 0 \ge 0.$
$z_2 = x_2 - x_1 \ge 0.$
$z_3 = x_3 - x_2 \ge 0.$
$z_4 = 18 - x_3 \ge 0.$
$z_1 + z_2 + z_3 + z_4 = 18.$
Number of non-negative integer solutions is $\binom{18+4-1}{4-1} = \binom{21}{3}.$

Alternatively, consider the mapping from $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ to multisets $\{x_1, x_2, x_3\}$ with elements from $\{0, 1, \ldots, 18\}.$
Number of non-decreasing sequences of length 3 from $\{0, 1, \ldots, 18\}.$
Consider $0 \le x_1 < x_2+1 < x_3+2 \le 18+2 = 20.$
Let $y_1 = x_1, y_2 = x_2+1, y_3 = x_3+2.$
$0 \le y_1 < y_2 < y_3 \le 20.$
We need to choose 3 distinct numbers from $\{0, 1, \ldots, 20\},$ which has 21 elements.
Number of ways is $\binom{21}{3}.$

Consider the number of non-decreasing sequences of length $k$ from $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}.$
Equivalent to choosing $k$ items from $n$ with replacement.
Stars and bars: $x_1 \le x_2 \le \cdots \le x_k,$ where $1 \le x_i \le n.$
Let $y_i = x_i + i - 1.$
$1 \le y_1 < y_2 < \cdots < y_k \le n + k - 1.$
Choose $k$ distinct numbers from $\{1, 2, \ldots, n+k-1\},$ $\binom{n+k-1}{k}.$

Here, the set is $\{0, 1, \ldots, 18\},$ size $19.$ Length $k=3.$
$\binom{19+3-1}{3} = \binom{21}{3}.$ Correct.

For the exponents of 5, we have $0 \le y_1 \le y_2 \le y_3 \le 9.$
Length 3, from $\{0, 1, \ldots, 9\},$ size 10.
$\binom{10+3-1}{3} = \binom{12}{3}.$ Correct.

Number of favorable triples = $\binom{21}{3} \cdot \binom{12}{3}.$
Total number of triples = $190^3.$

Probability = $\frac{\binom{21}{3} \binom{12}{3}}{190^3}.$

$\binom{21}{3} = \frac{21 \cdot 20 \cdot 19}{6} = 7 \cdot 10 \cdot 19 = 1330.$
$\binom{12}{3} = \frac{12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10}{6} = 2 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 = 220.$

Numerator = $1330 \cdot 220 = 133 \cdot 10 \cdot 22 \cdot 10 = 133 \cdot 22 \cdot 100 = 292600.$
Denominator = $190^3 = (19 \cdot 10)^3 = 19^3 \cdot 10^3 = 6859 \cdot 1000 = 6859000.$

Probability = $\frac{292600}{6859000} = \frac{2926}{68590}.$
Divide numerator and denominator by 10.

$\frac{2926}{68590} = \frac{1463}{34295}.$
$1463 = 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 19.$
$34295$ ends in 5, divisible by 5.
$34295 / 5 = 6859 = 19^3.$
So, $34295 = 5 \cdot 19^3.$

Probability = $\frac{7 \cdot 11 \cdot 19}{5 \cdot 19^3} = \frac{7 \cdot 11}{5 \cdot 19^2} = \frac{77}{5 \cdot 361} = \frac{77}{1805}.$

The probability is $\frac{77}{1805}.$
Given probability is $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m, n$ are relatively prime.
$m = 77,$ $n = 1805.$
$\gcd(77, 1805) = \gcd(7 \cdot 11, 5 \cdot 19^2) = 1.$
So, $m = 77.$

Alternative approach:
Consider two divisors $d_1, d_2.$ Probability that $d_1 | d_2.$
Let $d_1 = 2^{a_1} 5^{b_1},$ $d_2 = 2^{a_2} 5^{b_2}.$
$0 \le a_1, a_2 \le 18,$ $0 \le b_1, b_2 \le 9.$
Total number of pairs $(d_1, d_2)$ is $190 \cdot 190.$
Number of pairs such that $d_1 | d_2.$
$a_1 \le a_2,$ $b_1 \le b_2.$
Number of pairs $(a_1, a_2)$ such that $0 \le a_1 \le a_2 \le 18.$
Equivalent to choosing 2 numbers from $\{0, 1, \ldots, 18\}$ with replacement.
$\binom{18+2}{2} = \binom{20}{2} = \frac{20 \cdot 19}{2} = 190.$

Number of pairs $(b_1, b_2)$ such that $0 \le b_1 \le b_2 \le 9.$
$\binom{9+2}{2} = \binom{11}{2} = \frac{11 \cdot 10}{2} = 55.$

Number of pairs $(d_1, d_2)$ such that $d_1 | d_2$ is $190 \cdot 55.$
Probability that $a_1 | a_2$ is $\frac{190 \cdot 55}{190 \cdot 190} = \frac{55}{190} = \frac{11}{38}.$

Now consider the probability that $a_1 | a_2$ and $a_2 | a_3.$
Let $E_1$ be the event $a_1 | a_2,$ $E_2$ be the event $a_2 | a_3.$
We want $P(E_1 \cap E_2).$
Since the choices are independent, it might be tempting to say $P(E_1) P(E_2),$ but the events are not independent.

Consider the set of triples $(d_1, d_2, d_3)$ such that $d_1 | d_2 | d_3.$
Number of such triples is $\binom{21}{3} \binom{12}{3}.$
Total number of triples is $190^3.$
Probability is $\frac{\binom{21}{3} \binom{12}{3}}{190^3}.$

Consider a simpler case: divisors of $p^n.$ Divisors are $1, p, \ldots, p^n.$
Number of divisors is $n+1.$
Choose 3 divisors $p^{a_1}, p^{a_2}, p^{a_3},$ $0 \le a_i \le n.$
We want $a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3.$
Number of ways to choose $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ such that $0 \le a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3 \le n$ is $\binom{n+3}{3}.$
Total number of triples is $(n+1)^3.$
Probability is $\frac{\binom{n+3}{3}}{(n+1)^3}.$

If $n=1,$ divisors of $p$ are $1, p.$ $|S|=2.$
Triples: $(1,1,1), (1,1,p), (1,p,1), (p,1,1), (1,p,p), (p,1,p), (p,p,1), (p,p,p).$ Total 8.
Favorable triples: $(1,1,1), (1,1,p), (1,p,p), (p,p,p).$ Number 4.
Probability $4/8 = 1/2.$
Formula: $\frac{\binom{1+3}{3}}{(1+1)^3} = \frac{\binom{4}{3}}{2^3} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}.$ Matches.

Total triples $3^3 = 27.$

Probability $10/27.$
Formula: $\frac{\binom{2+3}{3}}{(2+1)^3} = \frac{\binom{5}{3}}{3^3} = \frac{10}{27}.$ Matches.

Probability that $a_1 | a_2$ is $\frac{190 \cdot 55}{190 \cdot 190} = \frac{55}{190} = \frac{11}{38}.$

Now consider the probability that $a_1 | a_2$ and $a_2 | a_3.$
Let $E_1$ be the event $a_1 | a_2,$ $E_2$ be the event $a_2 | a_3.$
We want $P(E_1 \cap E_2).$
Since the choices are independent, it might be tempting to say $P(E_1) P(E_2),$ but the events are not independent.

Consider the set of triples $(d_1, d_2, d_3)$ such that $d_1 | d_2 | d_3.$
Number of such triples is $\binom{21}{3} \binom{12}{3}.$
Total number of triples is $190^3.$
Probability is $\frac{\binom{21}{3} \binom{12}{3}}{190^3}.$

Consider a simpler case: divisors of $p^n.$ Divisors are $1, p, \ldots, p^n.$
Number of divisors is $n+1.$
Choose 3 divisors $p^{a_1}, p^{a_2}, p^{a_3},$ $0 \le a_i \le n.$
We want $a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3.$
Number of ways to choose $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ such that $0 \le a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3 \le n$ is $\binom{n+3}{3}.$
Total number of triples is $(n+1)^3.$
Probability is $\frac{\binom{n+3}{3}}{(n+1)^3}.$</text>
<explanation>The solver explores a different approach by first considering the probability of a single divisibility relationship (d₁|d₂), then attempting to extend to the case of two consecutive divisibility relationships. They also examine a simplified version of the problem with divisors of pⁿ. This demonstrates the ability to approach the problem from multiple angles and consider special cases to gain insight.</explanation>
