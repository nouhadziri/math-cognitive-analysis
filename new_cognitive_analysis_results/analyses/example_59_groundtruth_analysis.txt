Problem:
Jackie and Phil have two fair coins and a third coin that comes up heads with probability $\frac47$ . Jackie flips the three coins, and then Phil flips the three coins. Let $\frac {m}{n}$ be the probability that Jackie gets the same number of heads as Phil, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$ .

<explanation>The entire solution shows the solver has interpreted the problem correctly, understanding they need to find the probability that Jackie and Phil get the same number of heads when flipping three coins. The answer "515" indicates they've found the values of m and n (where the probability is m/n) and calculated m+n. While the detailed work isn't shown, the correct answer demonstrates successful problem interpretation.</explanation>

<explanation>Though the working isn't shown, reaching the correct answer of 515 indicates the solver successfully modeled the probability space of flipping three coins (two fair coins and one biased coin) twice. They would have needed to determine all possible outcomes and their probabilities for both Jackie and Phil.</explanation>

<text>515</text>
<explanation>The solver has successfully translated the coin-flipping scenario into a formal probability problem. To reach the answer 515, they would have formalized the problem by defining random variables for the number of heads in each person's flips and calculated the probability that these random variables are equal.</explanation>

<start>0</start>
<end>515</end>
<text>515</text>
<explanation>The answer 515 suggests the solver found a probability fraction m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, and m+n=515. This demonstrates application of the number theory concept of relatively prime numbers (numbers whose greatest common divisor is 1).</explanation>

<explanation>The correct answer of 515 indicates the solver performed all calculations accurately. This would have involved calculating probabilities for different outcomes, finding the total probability of Jackie and Phil getting the same number of heads, expressing this as a fraction in lowest terms, and adding the numerator and denominator.</explanation>
