Problem:
Twenty five of King Arthur's knights are seated at their customary round table. Three of them are chosen - all choices being equally likely - and are sent off to slay a troublesome dragon. Let $P$ be the probability that at least two of the three had been sitting next to each other. If $P$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator? 

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to find the probability that at least two of the three knights chosen were sitting next to each other at the round table. There are 25 knights in total, all seated around a round table. Let me think about how to approach this.

Hmm. Since it's a probability problem, the basic formula is the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 3 knights out of 25. That should be combinations, right? So the total outcomes would be C(25,3). Let me check: combinations are used when the order doesn't matter. Since the problem states that all choices are equally likely, and we aren't told that the order matters, so yes, combinations.

So total possible outcomes: C(25,3) = 2300 / 6? Wait, hold on. C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)! ). So 25! / (3! * 22!) = (25 * 24 * 23) / (6) = (25 * 24 * 23) / 6. Let me compute that. 24 divided by 6 is 4, so 25 * 4 * 23. 25*4 is 100, so 100*23 is 2300. So total possible outcomes are 2300. Ok.

Now the favorable outcomes are the number of ways to choose 3 knights such that at least two are sitting next to each other. Hmm. The phrase "at least two" can sometimes be tricky. It could mean exactly two or all three. So maybe I can calculate the number of ways for exactly two adjacent and the third not adjacent, plus the number of ways for all three adjacent, and then add them together. But another approach could be to compute the total desired probability by considering 1 minus the probability that no two are adjacent. Wait, that might be easier. Let me see.

Probability that at least two are adjacent is 1 minus the probability that no two are adjacent. So if I can compute the number of ways to choose three knights where none are adjacent, then subtract that from the total, then divide by total to get the probability, then subtract that from 1. Hmm.

This seems plausible. So let's try that second approach. But since it's a circular table, adjacency is a bit different from a linear table. In a circle, the first and last seats are adjacent. So we need to account for that.

But the formula for the number of ways to choose k non-consecutive objects from n arranged in a circle is a known combinatorial problem. Let me recall. If I remember correctly, for a circle, the number is C(n - k, k) - C(n - k - 1, k - 1). Wait, no. Hmm. Or is there another formula?

Alternatively, since arranging people in a circle complicates things, maybe we can fix one person's position to make it linear. Because when dealing with circular arrangements, fixing one position breaks the symmetry and converts it to a linear problem. So here's an idea: fix one knight's position. Then the problem becomes arranging the remaining knights in a line. Wait, but maybe not necessary. Let me try.

Suppose I fix one knight at a specific seat, then the remaining seats are in a line? But it's still a circle. Wait, perhaps the formula for non-consecutive selection on a circle is different. Maybe I should look it up or work it out.

Alternatively, let's consider linear arrangements first. For a linear arrangement of n seats, the number of ways to choose k non-consecutive seats is C(n - k + 1, k). But on a circle, adjacency wraps around, so the first and last seats are adjacent, so it's different. Therefore, maybe the formula is C(n - k, k) + C(n - k - 1, k - 1). Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I need to derive it.

Another approach: think of the circular table. If we choose three knights such that none are adjacent, we need to ensure that there's at least one seat between each pair. So it's similar to placing three people around the table such that there are no two next to each other. This might be related to arranging people with gaps between them.

In combinatorics, arranging non-consecutive objects around a circle. Let me consider this. When dealing with circular arrangements with non-consecutive objects, the problem is a bit more complex.

First for linear arrangements. Suppose you have n chairs in a line, and you need to choose k chairs such that no two are adjacent. The number of ways is C(n - k + 1, k). For example, if n = 5, k = 2, then C(5 - 2 + 1, 2) = C(4,2) = 6. Which is correct.

On a circle, the chairs are arranged in a circle, so the first and last chairs are adjacent. Therefore, the same formula isn't directly applicable because selecting the first and second chairs would make them adjacent. But if none can be adjacent, then the problem wraps around. So the formula I think is C(n - k, k) + C(n - k - 1, k - 1). Wait. That may not be correct.

Wait, here's a method. When arranging k non-consecutive chairs around a circular table:

Fix one person's seat, then arrange the remaining. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the formula for circular non-adjacent combinations is C(n - k, k) + C(n - k - 1, k - 1). But I need to be cautious here.

Alternatively, there is a formula for the number of ways to select k non-consecutive people seated around a circular table: (n / (n)) [C(n - k, k) + ... ]? Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe better to model it as placing the three people and making sure they are not adjacent.

Alternative method: think about creating gaps between the selected knights. When arranging objects around a circle, the concept of gaps is a standard technique. For linear arrangements, if you have k objects, they form k + 1 gaps, but on a circular table, the start and end are connected, so there's one fewer gap.

But perhaps another approach is to convert the circular problem into a linear one by "breaking" the circle at a fixed position. This would avoid considering the circular symmetry.

Here's the idea. If I fix one seat, say seat 1, to be either selected or not selected. Then, we can linearize the rest.

Wait, for the problem at hand, we can consider two cases: the three knights include seat 1 or not. But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, using inclusion-exclusion. To compute the number of triplets with no two adjacent, perhaps subtracting the triplets with at least one pair adjacent.

Wait, no. The original problem is to compute the triplets with at least two adjacent, so maybe inclusion-exclusion directly.

But another approach could be efficient here.

Wait. Alternatively, here's a formula I found on thinking. The number of ways to select three non-consecutive people around a circular table is C(n - 3, 3) - n. Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

In linear arrangements, the formula for the number of ways to choose three non-consecutive people in a line is C(n - 3 + 1, 3) = C(n - 2, 3). But on a circular table, adjusting this.

In a circle, if we want three people with no two adjacent, we can consider this: imagine unrolling the circle into a line. However, once unrolled, we have a linear arrangement where the first and last seats are adjacent. Thus, in this case, it's similar to linear with the additional consideration that seat 1 and seat n can't both be chosen. Therefore, the number of non-consecutive triples on a circle is equal to the number of non-consecutive triples on a line of length n minus the number of triples that include both seat 1 and seat n when that would be disallowed.

But this might lead to a complex calculation.

Alternatively, here's a method called the gap method. For linear arrangements, to deal with non-consecutive objects, you place the objects in gaps between the other objects, but for circular ones, it's a bit different.

When we have n seats arranged in a circle and want to choose k seats such that none are adjacent, the formula is n - k * k. Wait, that's probably not correct.

Alternatively, here's another way. Suppose n is the number of seats, and k the number of people. Arrange the n - k people first, which creates n - k gaps around the table. Then, place the k people into those gaps, each gap taking at most one person. So, the number of ways would be C(n - k, k).

Wait, but for a circle, the formula is similar to linear. For linear arrangements with n seats, non-consecutive k seats: C(n - k + 1, k). For circular arrangements, the difference is that the first and last positions are adjacent, so we have to ensure that they are not both chosen. So maybe for circular arrangements, the formula is C(n - k, k) + C(n - k - 1, k -1). But we need to get precise.

Wait, here's a source.

Ok, to calculate the number of ways of choosing k non-consecutive seats around a circular table with n seats.

The formula is indeed C(n - k, k) + C(n - k - 1, k - 1). But how?

Let me think of two cases:

Case 1: seat 1 is not chosen. Then the remaining n - 1 seats form a line from seat 2 to seat n. Then the number of ways is C((n - 1) - k + 1, k) = C(n - k, k)

But in that linear arrangement, after choosing seats 2 to n, and seat 1 is not chosen, so it's like a line.

Case 2: seat 1 is chosen. Then seats 2 and n cannot be chosen. Then effectively, seats 3 to n - 1 remain, which is n - 3 seats. And we need to choose k - 1 seats from there, and none adjacent.

But again, that becomes a linear problem from seats 3 to n -1, which is n - 3 seats. So the number of ways would be C((n - 3) - (k - 1) + 1, k -1 )=C(n - k - 1, k -1).

So total number is C(n - k, k) + C(n - k -1, k -1). Therefore, for the circular table, the number of ways is C(n - k, k) + C(n -k - 1, k -1)

Therefore, plugging in n=25, k=3:

Number of ways: C(25 -3,3) + C(25 -3 -1,3 -1) = C(22,3)+C(21,2) right?

C(22,3)= 1540, C(21,2)=210.

So total number of non-adjacent triples is 1540 + 210 = 1750?

Wait, so then if that's correct, the number of triplets where none are adjacent is 1750. So total possible triplets is 2300.

Therefore, the number we desire (the number with at least two adjacent) is 2300 -1750 = 550.

Therefore, the probability is 550 /2300.

Simplify that: 550 divides by 10, becomes55/230. Then 55 and 230 divide by 5: 11/46. So, probability is 11/46, thus numerator plus denominator = 11 + 46 = 57.

Wait, but before I get confident, let me verify. Wait, first, let's check if the formula is applicable here.

The formula for circular arrangements non-consecutive is C(n - k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1). So for 25 knights, choose 3 with none adjacent, the formula gives:

C(25 -3,3)=C(22,3)=1540,

C(25 −3 −1,3 −1)=C(21,2)=210, which adds to 1750. Then total triplets:2300.

1750 /2300 reduces to 35/46, which is the probability none are adjacent. Then 1 -35/46=11/46, so Probability of at least two adjacent is11/46, sum 57.

But before being sure, let me check with another approach. Alternatively, maybe count the number of triplets with at least two adjacent directly, using inclusion-exclusion.

Let me see.

First, total number of triplets: C(25,3)=2300.

Number of triplet pairs where at least two are adjacent can be calculated as:

First, count the number of pairs with exactly two adjacent (and the third not adjacent) and triplets where all three are adjacent. Then sum these two numbers.

So, first, count how many adjacent pairs there are. There are 25 knights in a circle, so 25 adjacent pairs (since each knight has two neighbors, but in a circle it's 25 pairs). Then for each adjacent pair, we can choose a third knight not adjacent to either. Wait, but need to make sure the third is not adjacent to either knight in the pair.

Each pair has two knights. For a pair sitting next to each other, there are two knights adjacent to the pair. For example, knights 1 and 2 are adjacent. Knights 25 and 1 and 3 are adjacent to the pair.

So for each pair, the two adjacent knights are neighbors of the pair. So, from each adjacent pair, we need to exclude those two knights when selecting the third. Therefore, for each adjacent pair, there are 25 - 4 =21 knights left? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, each adjacent pair consists of knight i and i+1. The adjacent knights to this pair are knight i-1 and knight i+2. So to pick a third knight not adjacent to either knight in the pair, we need to exclude knights i-1, i, i+1, i+2. But we're choosing the third knight, not from the entire seats, but avoid those adjacent. Wait, but knights i and i+1 are already excluded? Wait no, actually, wait. The third knight can't be adjacent to either of the two in the original pair.

Original pair is knights X and Y. Third knight can't be adjacent to X or Y.

Since X and Y are adjacent, the knights adjacent to X are (X-1) and Y; knights adjacent to Y are X and (Y+1). So avoiding X-1, X's neighbors (Y), and Y's neighbor (Y+1 and X is already part of the pair). So the forbidden knights for the third knight are X-1, Y+1, X, and Y. So that's four knights. Therefore, total forbidden knights adjacent to the pair: X-1, Y+1, X, Y. So 25 -4=21 allowed knights. Wait, but since it's a circle, X-1 and Y+1 could coincide if the pair is next to each other and covering the circle? For example, if I take pair 25 and 1, then X=25, Y=1. X-1=24, Y+1=2. So forbidden knights would be 24, 2. So forbidden knights are 24,1,2. But original pair is 25 and 1, which are already chosen. So forbidden knights adjacent to the pair are 24,1,2. Wait, is the pair not part of the forbidden? Wait, the third knight can't be adjacent to either knight in the pair, so adjacent knights to each of the pair. But X and Y are part of the pair, so adjacent to X are X-1 and X+1=Y. Adjacent to Y are Y-1=X and Y+1. But since X and Y are part of the pair, we need to exclude the two knights adjacent to X (which are X-1 and Y) and the two knights adjacent to Y (which are X and Y+1). So if the third knight can't be adjacent to X or Y, what are the forbidden positions? It would be X-1, Y+1, and the pair themselves. But since we must pick a third knight not adjacent to X or Y, then we need to exclude X-1, Y+1, and X and Y. But X and Y are already chosen, right? Wait, the pair is two knights, and we need a third not adjacent to either. So adjacent to X: X-1 and X+1, which is Y for adjacent. And adjacent to Y: Y-1, which is X, and Y+1. So the forbidden knights are X-1, Y+1, X, Y.

X and Y are already part of the pair, so third knight cannot be X or Y but since we are only choosing one knight, we'll already exclude them. But the adjacent ones are X-1 and Y+1, but since they might overlap. Wait, in the example with pair (25,1), as X=25, Y=1, then X-1=24 and Y+1=2. So forbidden knights adjacent to the pair are 24,1,2 (but 1 is the same as Y, which is selected. So while choosing a third knight, which cannot be adjacent to either X or Y, so their neighbors X-1 and Y+1.

But X is 25 and Y is 1, as a pair, so the forbidden knights for third would be 24 and 2, besides X=25 and Y=1. But can the third knight be 25 or1? No, because the third knight must not be any in the pair. So forbidden are X, Y, X-1, Y+1. So number of forbidden seats is 4 (knights X, Y, X -1, Y+1). Therefore, the number of available knights is 25 - 4 =21.

Wait, but since pairs are adjacent, X=1 and Y=2, then forbidden are 25,3,1,2, so again 25-4=21. So for any adjacent pair, the third knight needs to be from 25-4=21 knights.

So the number of triplets with exactly two adjacent knights is number of adjacent pairs * 21. But but adjacent pairs, as there are 25 adjacent pairs in a 25-seat circle. So each pair gives 21 possibilities.

So triplets where exactly two are adjacent: 25 *21=525.

But we need to check for overlaps. If two different pairs would generate the same triplet? Wait, suppose adjacent pair (1,2) and in triplet (1,2, 5). Similarly, adjacent pair (2,3) could generate triplet(2,3,5). Similarly, different pairs can lead to same triplet, but in the way being calculated, if two adjacent pairs with overlapping elements might generate same triplet. For example, triplet (1,2,5) is constructed only via pair (1,2). Similarly, triplet (2,3,5) is only done via (2,3). So if two adjacent pairs, non overlapping, generating the same triplet, which does not really happen. Because each triplet with exactly two adjacent elements can only come from one adjacent pair. Unless there are two different adjacent pairs in the triplet. But no, the triplet has three elements, if exactly two are adjacent, then only one pair is adjacent. The third is not adjacent to this pair, and since the third is non adjacent to both elements of the pair, then adding another adjacent pair would force another adjacent knight. Therefore, the triplet can only come from one adjacent pair. Therefore, overcounting shouldn't occur.

Therefore, 25*21=525 represents triplets with exactly two adjacent.

Then, triplets where all three are adjacent. How many triplets are contiguous groups of three knights.

In a circular table of 25, the number of contiguous triplets is equal to the number of seats, 25. Each seat can be the starting point. So adjacent triplets with all three seated consecutively would be 25.

Therefore, total number of triplets with at least two adjacent knights would be 525+25=550.

Then the probability would be 550/2300=11/46. Same as before. So sum is 11+46=57? That's the answer. So if both methods give the same result, that increases my confidence.

But let me recheck.

Alternative, you find your number of non-consecutive arrangements.

If according to the first method, linear approach for circular problems, n=25; the number was

n-k, so 25-3=22. So C(22,3)=1540, and 25-3-1=21, so C(21,2)=210. So 1540+210=1750. Then total triplets-C(25,3)=2300. So those with at least two adjacent=2300-1750=550, 550/2300=11/46, so yes.

Alternatively, verify counts with inclusion-exclusion: total of 25 adjacent pairs, each with 21 possibilities for third person=525, plus triples with all three adjacent=25, total 550. So same. Therefore, seems correct.

Therefore, answer is 11/46, sum is 11+46=57.

**Final Answer**

But again, that becomes a linear problem from seats 3 to n -1, which is n - 3 seats. So the number of ways would be C((n - 3) - (k - 1) + 1, k -1 )=C(n - k - 1, k -1).</text>

<text>Wait, but before I get confident, let me verify. Wait, first, let's check if the formula is applicable here.

The formula for circular arrangements non-consecutive is C(n - k, k) + C(n -k -1, k -1). So for 25 knights, choose 3 with none adjacent, the formula gives:

C(25 -3,3)=C(22,3)=1540,

First, total number of triplets: C(25,3)=2300.</text>
<explanation>The solver decides to verify their solution using a completely different approach (direct counting with inclusion-exclusion) to cross-check their answer. This shows a thorough validation strategy to ensure the solution is correct.</explanation>

<start>12641</start>

<text>Therefore, total number of triplets with at least two adjacent knights would be 525+25=550.

Then the probability would be 550/2300=11/46. Same as before. So sum is 11+46=57? That's the answer. So if both methods give the same result, that increases my confidence.

But let me recheck.

But in that linear arrangement, after choosing seats 2 to n, and seat 1 is not chosen, so it's like a line.

Case 2: seat 1 is chosen. Then seats 2 and n cannot be chosen. Then effectively, seats 3 to n - 1 remain, which is n - 3 seats. And we need to choose k - 1 seats from there, and none adjacent.

But again, that becomes a linear problem from seats 3 to n -1, which is n - 3 seats. So the number of ways would be C((n - 3) - (k - 1) + 1, k -1 )=C(n - k - 1, k -1).</text>

So, first, count how many adjacent pairs there are. There are 25 knights in a circle, so 25 adjacent pairs (since each knight has two neighbors, but in a circle it's 25 pairs).</text>
<explanation>In the alternative approach, the solver breaks down the problem into two cases: triplets with exactly two adjacent knights and triplets with all three adjacent knights. This demonstrates case analysis to handle the "at least two" condition by examining different scenarios.</explanation>

<start>12485</start>
<end>12640</end>
<text>In a circular table of 25, the number of contiguous triplets is equal to the number of seats, 25. Each seat can be the starting point. So adjacent triplets with all three seated consecutively would be 25.

Therefore, total number of triplets with at least two adjacent knights would be 525+25=550.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes the case of triplets with all three adjacent knights separately, then combines this with the previous case of exactly two adjacent knights to get the total count. This shows systematic case analysis to reach a comprehensive solution.</explanation>

<start>1341</start>
<end>1431</end>
<text>But another approach could be to compute the total desired probability by considering 1 minus the probability that no two are adjacent. Wait, that might be easier.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates metacognition by evaluating their current approach, recognizing a potentially easier alternative, and making a strategic decision to shift methods. This shows awareness and monitoring of their own problem-solving process.</explanation>

<start>5414</start>
<end>5455</end>
<text>Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.</text>
<explanation>This brief statement shows the solver recognizing that their current approach may not be optimal or correct. They pause to reevaluate, demonstrating metacognitive monitoring and control of their problem-solving process.</explanation>

<start>9507</start>
<end>9610</end>
<text>Wait, but before I get confident, let me verify. Wait, first, let's check if the formula is applicable here.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates metacognition by questioning their own confidence and deciding to verify their approach before proceeding. This shows awareness of the need for validation and careful monitoring of their solution process.</explanation>
