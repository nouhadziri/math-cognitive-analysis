Problem:
Let  $\mathcal F$  be the set of functions  $f(x,y)$  that are twice continuously differentiable for  $x\geq 1$ ,  $y\geq 1$  and that satisfy the following two equations (where subscripts denote partial derivatives):
\[xf_x + yf_y = xy\ln(xy),\] \[x^2f_{xx} + y^2f_{yy} = xy.\]
For each  $f\in\mathcal F$ , let
\[
m(f) = \min_{s\geq 1}\left(f(s+1,s+1) - f(s+1,s)-f(s,s+1) + f(s,s)\right).
\]
Determine  $m(f)$ , and show that it is independent of the choice of  $f$ .

Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Key Observation**: We need to find \( f_{xy} \). Start by differentiating the first given equation \( xf_x + yf_y = xy \log(xy) \) with respect to \( x \):
   \[
   x f_{xx} + f_x + y f_{xy} = y \left( \log y + \log x + 1 \right)
   \]
   Simplify to:
   \[
   x f_{xx} + f_x + y f_{xy} = y \left( \log(xy) + 1 \right)
   \]
   Multiply by \( x \):
   \[
   x^2 f_{xx} + x f_x + xy f_{xy} = xy \left( \log(xy) + 1 \right)
   \]
2. **Analogous Equation for \( y \)**: Differentiate the first equation with respect to \( y \):
   \[
   y f_{yy} + f_y + x f_{xy} = x \left( \log x + \log y + 1 \right)
   \]
   Simplify to:
   \[
   y f_{yy} + f_y + x f_{xy} = x \left( \log(xy) + 1 \right)
   \]
   Multiply by \( y \):
   \[
   y^2 f_{yy} + y f_y + xy f_{xy} = xy \left( \log(xy) + 1 \right)
   \]
3. **Combine Equations**: Add the two equations:
   \[
   x^2 f_{xx} + y^2 f_{yy} + x f_x + y f_y + 2xy f_{xy} = 2xy \left( \log(xy) + 1 \right)
   \]
   Using the second given equation \( x^2 f_{xx} + y^2 f_{yy} = xy \):
   \[
   xy + x f_x + y f_y + 2xy f_{xy} = 2xy \left( \log(xy) + 1 \right)
   \]
   Substitute \( xf_x + yf_y = xy \log(xy) \):
   \[
   xy + xy \log(xy) + 2xy f_{xy} = 2xy \left( \log(xy) + 1 \right)
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   xy + xy \log(xy) + 2xy f_{xy} = 2xy \log(xy) + 2xy
   \]
   \[
   2xy f_{xy} = xy \log(xy) + xy
   \]
   \[
   f_{xy} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \log(xy) + 1 \right)
   \]
   This completes the proof of the key observation.

4. **Integrate to Find \( f \)**: Integrate \( f_{xy} \) with respect to \( x \):
   \[
   f_x = \int \frac{1}{2} \left( \log(xy) + 1 \right) dy = \frac{1}{2} y \log(xy) + C(x)
   \]
   Integrate again with respect to \( y \):
   \[
   f = \int \left( \frac{1}{2} y \log(xy) + C(x) \right) dy = \frac{1}{2} xy \log(xy) - \frac{1}{2} xy + D(x) + E(y)
   \]
5. **Determine \( D(x) \) and \( E(y) \)**: Substitute \( f \) into the first given equation:
   \[
   x D'(x) + y E'(y) = 0
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   x D'(x) = -y E'(y) = A
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   D(x) = A \log x, \quad E(y) = -A \log y
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   f = \frac{1}{2} xy \log(xy) - \frac{1}{2} xy + A \log \left( \frac{x}{y} \right) + B
   \]

6. **Functional \( T(f, s) \)**: Define:
   \[
   T(f, s) = f(s+1, s+1) - f(s+1, s) - f(s, s+1) + f(s, s)
   \]
   Since \( T \) is linear in \( f \) and \( T(A \log(x/y) + B) = 0 \), it suffices to find \( T \left( \frac{1}{2} xy \log(xy) - \frac{1}{2} xy, s \right) \).

7. **Calculate \( T \)**:
   \[
   T(xy, s) = 1
   \]
   \[
   T(xy \log(xy), s) = 2(s+1)^2 \log(s+1) + 2s^2 \log(s) - 2s(s+1) \log(s(s+1))
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   T(xy \log(xy), s) = 2 \log \left( \frac{(s+1)^s}{s^s} \right)
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   m(f) = \min_{s \geq 1} \left( \log \left( \frac{(s+1)^s}{s^s} \right) + \frac{1}{2} \right) = \boxed{\frac{1}{2} + \log 4}
   \]
