Problem:
Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram .  Extend $\overline{DA}$ through $A$ to a point $P,$ and let $\overline{PC}$ meet $\overline{AB}$ at $Q$ and $\overline{DB}$ at $R.$ Given that $PQ = 735$ and $QR = 112,$ find $RC.$

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the length of the segment $RC,$ given a parallelogram $ABCD$ and some information about the lengths of segments formed by the intersection of lines.

We are given a parallelogram $ABCD.$ Let the vertices be labeled in a counterclockwise order.
The properties of a parallelogram include:
1. Opposite sides are parallel: $AB \parallel DC$ and $AD \parallel BC.$
2. Opposite sides are equal in length: $AB = DC$ and $AD = BC.$
3. Opposite angles are equal: $\angle DAB = \angle BCD$ and $\angle ABC = \angle CDA.$
4. Consecutive angles are supplementary: $\angle DAB + \angle ABC = 180^\circ,$ etc.
5. The diagonals bisect each other.

Point $P$ is on the extension of $\overline{DA}$ through $A.$ This means $A$ lies between $P$ and $D.$ The order of points is $P, A, D.$

The line segment $\overline{PC}$ intersects $\overline{AB}$ at $Q$ and $\overline{DB}$ at $R.$

We are given $PQ = 735$ and $QR = 112.$
We need to find the length of $RC.$

Let's draw a diagram to visualize the situation.

```mermaid

    A -- parallel --> B
    B -- parallel --> C
    C -- parallel --> D
    D -- parallel --> A
    P --- A

    subgraph Parallelogram ABCD
        A
        B
        C
        D
    end

    P -- line --> C

    PC -- intersects --> AB at Q
    PC -- intersects --> DB at R
```

The points $P, Q, R, C$ are collinear in that order on the line segment $PC.$
We have $P-Q-R-C.$
The lengths are $PQ = 735$ and $QR = 112.$
The length $PR = PQ + QR = 735 + 112 = 847.$

Consider $\triangle PAP$ and the line segment $BC.$
Since $AD \parallel BC,$ we have $PA \parallel BC.$
Consider $\triangle PB C.$ The line segment $AQ$ is part of the line $AB.$
Since $AB \parallel DC,$ we have $AQ \parallel DC.$

Consider $\triangle PBC$ and the transversal line $AB.$
The intersection point is $Q.$
Consider $\triangle PAD$ and the transversal line $BC.$

Let's use similar triangles.

Consider $\triangle PAQ$ and $\triangle CBQ.$
Since $PA \parallel BC,$ we have $\angle QPA = \angle QCB$ (alternate interior angles) and $\angle PAQ = \angle CBQ$ (alternate interior angles).
Therefore, $\triangle PAQ \sim \triangle CBQ.$

From the similarity, we have the ratios of corresponding sides:
$\frac{PQ}{CQ} = \frac{AQ}{BQ} = \frac{PA}{CB}.$

We have $PQ = 735.$ Let $QC = QR + RC = 112 + RC.$
$\frac{735}{112 + RC} = \frac{AQ}{BQ} = \frac{PA}{CB}.$

Now consider the intersection with the diagonal $DB.$
Consider $\triangle PDB$ and the transversal line $CR.$
The intersection point is $R.$

Consider $\triangle PAR$ and $\triangle CBR.$ These are not directly similar.

Consider $\triangle PAB$ and the transversal $PC.$
Consider $\triangle PBC$ and the transversal $DB.$

Consider $\triangle DPR$ and $\triangle BRC.$
These triangles share a common vertex angle at $R.$
However, the sides are not necessarily parallel.

Consider $\triangle PRD$ and $\triangle CRB.$
We have $\angle PRD = \angle CRB$ (vertically opposite angles).

Consider $\triangle PAD$ and the line $PQC.$
Consider $\triangle PBC$ and the line $PQC.$

Let's focus on the point $R,$ which is the intersection of $PC$ and $DB.$

Consider $\triangle PAB.$ The line $QC$ intersects the sides.
Consider $\triangle DBC.$ The point $R$ lies on $DB.$

Consider $\triangle PAD.$
Consider $\triangle PBC.$

Let's use Menelaus' Theorem on $\triangle DAB$ with transversal line $PQC.$
The points on the sides (or extensions) are $P$ on $DA,$ $Q$ on $AB,$ and $C$ on the extension of $BD.$  No, this is incorrect.

Let's use Menelaus' Theorem on $\triangle ABD$ with transversal line $P-Q-C.$
The transversal intersects the sides (or extensions) $DA$ at $P,$ $AB$ at $Q,$ and $BD$ at $R.$
The vertices of the triangle are $A, B, D.$
The points on the sides (or extensions) are $P$ on line $AD,$ $Q$ on line $AB,$ $R$ on line $DB.$

The theorem states: $\frac{AP}{PD} \cdot \frac{DR}{RB} \cdot \frac{BQ}{QA} = 1.$

We need to find the ratios involved.

From the similarity of $\triangle PAQ$ and $\triangle CBQ,$ we have $\frac{PA}{CB} = \frac{AQ}{BQ}.$
Since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, $CB = DA.$
So, $\frac{PA}{DA} = \frac{AQ}{BQ}.$

Let $PA = x.$ Then $PD = PA + AD = x + AD.$
$\frac{x}{x + AD} = \frac{AQ}{BQ}.$

Let $AQ = y.$ Then $BQ = AB - AQ = AB - y.$
$\frac{x}{x + AD} = \frac{y}{AB - y}.$
$x(AB - y) = y(x + AD)$
$x \cdot AB - xy = xy + y \cdot AD$
$x \cdot AB = 2xy + y \cdot AD.$

Now, let's look at the Menelaus' Theorem equation:
$\frac{AP}{PD} \cdot \frac{DR}{RB} \cdot \frac{BQ}{QA} = 1.$
$\frac{x}{AD} \cdot \frac{DR}{RB} \cdot \frac{BQ}{AQ} = 1.$

From the similarity, $\frac{AQ}{BQ} = \frac{PA}{CB} = \frac{PA}{AD} = \frac{x}{AD}.$
So, $\frac{BQ}{AQ} = \frac{AD}{x}.$

Substitute this into the Menelaus' equation:
$\frac{x}{AD} \cdot \frac{DR}{RB} \cdot \frac{AD}{x} = 1.$
$\frac{DR}{RB} = 1.$
This implies $DR = RB.$
So, $R$ is the midpoint of the diagonal $DB.$

This seems wrong, as the position of $P$ was arbitrary. Let's recheck the Menelaus application.

Consider $\triangle DAB$ and the transversal $P-Q-C.$
The points are $P$ on the extension of $DA,$ $Q$ on $AB,$ $R$ on $DB.$
The sides of the triangle are $DA, AB, BD.$

The transversal intersects the lines containing the sides at $P, Q, R.$

Menelaus' Theorem for $\triangle DAB$ and transversal $PQC$:
$\frac{DP}{PA} \cdot \frac{AQ}{QB} \cdot \frac{BR}{RD} = 1.$

We have $PQ = 735$ and $QR = 112.$
Consider $\triangle PAQ \sim \triangle CBQ.$
$\frac{PA}{CB} = \frac{PQ}{CQ} = \frac{AQ}{BQ}.$
$\frac{PA}{AD} = \frac{735}{112 + RC}.$
$\frac{AQ}{BQ} = \frac{735}{112 + RC}.$

Substitute into Menelaus' equation:
$\frac{DP}{PA} = \frac{DA + AP}{AP} = \frac{AD}{AP} + 1.$

We need to relate $AP$ to $RC.$

Consider $\triangle PBR$ and $\triangle CDR.$
$\angle BPR = \angle DCR$ (alternate interior angles, $AB \parallel DC$).
$\angle PBR = \angle CDR$ (alternate interior angles, $AD \parallel BC$).
So, $\triangle PBR \sim \triangle CDR.$

From the similarity, $\frac{PB}{CD} = \frac{PR}{CR} = \frac{BR}{DR}.$
We have $PR = PQ + QR = 735 + 112 = 847.$
$CD = AB.$
$\frac{PB}{AB} = \frac{847}{CR} = \frac{BR}{DR}.$

Consider the ratio $\frac{BR}{RD}.$
From Menelaus' Theorem:
$\frac{DP}{PA} \cdot \frac{AQ}{QB} \cdot \frac{BR}{RD} = 1.$
$\frac{DA + AP}{AP} \cdot \frac{AQ}{AB - AQ} \cdot \frac{BR}{RD} = 1.$

We know $\frac{AQ}{BQ} = \frac{PA}{CB} = \frac{PA}{AD}.$
So, $\frac{AQ}{AB - AQ} = \frac{PA}{AD}.$
$AQ \cdot AD = PA (AB - AQ) = PA \cdot AB - PA \cdot AQ.$
$AQ (AD + PA) = PA \cdot AB.$
$AQ \cdot DP = PA \cdot AB.$
$\frac{AQ}{PA} = \frac{AB}{DP}.$

Substitute back into Menelaus' equation:
$(\frac{AD}{AP} + 1) \cdot \frac{PA}{AD} \cdot \frac{BR}{RD} = 1.$
$(\frac{AD + AP}{AP}) \cdot \frac{PA}{AD} \cdot \frac{BR}{RD} = 1.$
$\frac{DP}{AP} \cdot \frac{AP}{AD} \cdot \frac{BR}{RD} = 1.$
$\frac{DP}{AD} \cdot \frac{BR}{RD} = 1.$
$\frac{DA + AP}{AD} \cdot \frac{BR}{RD} = 1.$
$(1 + \frac{AP}{AD}) \cdot \frac{BR}{RD} = 1.$

From $\triangle PBR \sim \triangle CDR,$ we have $\frac{BR}{DR} = \frac{PB}{CD} = \frac{PA + AB}{AB}.$
Substitute this into the equation:
$(1 + \frac{AP}{AD}) \cdot \frac{PA + AB}{AB} = 1.$
$\frac{AD + AP}{AD} \cdot \frac{PA + AB}{AB} = 1.$
$(AD + AP)(PA + AB) = AD \cdot AB.$
$AD \cdot PA + AD \cdot AB + AP^2 + AP \cdot AB = AD \cdot AB.$
$AD \cdot PA + AP^2 + AP \cdot AB = 0.$
$AP (AD + AP + AB) = 0.$
Since $AP > 0,$ we have $AD + AP + AB = 0,$ which is impossible since lengths are positive.

Let's recheck the application of Menelaus' Theorem.

Triangle $ABD,$ transversal $PQC.$
Points $P$ on line $DA,$ $Q$ on line $AB,$ $R$ on line $DB.$
$\frac{DP}{PA} \cdot \frac{AQ}{QB} \cdot \frac{BR}{RD} = 1.$

We have $\frac{AQ}{QB} = \frac{PA}{AD}.$
$\frac{DP}{PA} \cdot \frac{PA}{AD} \cdot \frac{BR}{RD} = 1.$
$\frac{DP}{AD} \cdot \frac{BR}{RD} = 1.$
$\frac{DA + AP}{AD} \cdot \frac{BR}{RD} = 1.$

From $\triangle PBR \sim \triangle CDR,$ we have $\frac{PR}{CR} = \frac{PB}{CD} = \frac{PA + AB}{AB}.$
$\frac{847}{CR} = \frac{PA + AB}{AB}.$

Let's use ratios from similar triangles.
$\triangle PAQ \sim \triangle CBQ \implies \frac{PQ}{CQ} = \frac{PA}{CB} \implies \frac{735}{112 + RC} = \frac{PA}{AD}.$
$735 \cdot AD = PA (112 + RC).$ (Equation 1)

$\triangle PBR \sim \triangle CDR \implies \frac{PR}{CR} = \frac{PB}{CD} \implies \frac{847}{RC} = \frac{PA + AB}{AB}.$
$847 \cdot AB = RC (PA + AB).$ (Equation 2)

We need to find $RC.$ Let $RC = x.$
From Equation 1: $735 \cdot AD = PA (112 + x).$

Consider the ratios from $\triangle PAQ \sim \triangle CBQ.$
$\frac{AQ}{BQ} = \frac{PA}{CB} = \frac{PA}{AD}.$
$\frac{AQ}{AB - AQ} = \frac{PA}{AD}.$
$AQ \cdot AD = PA (AB - AQ) = PA \cdot AB - PA \cdot AQ.$
$AQ (AD + PA) = PA \cdot AB.$
$AQ \cdot DP = PA \cdot AB.$

From Equation 2: $847 \cdot AB = x (PA + AB).$
$847 \cdot AB = x \cdot PA + x \cdot AB.$
$847 \cdot AB - x \cdot AB = x \cdot PA.$
$AB (847 - x) = x \cdot PA.$
$PA = \frac{AB (847 - x)}{x}.$

Substitute $PA$ into Equation 1:
$735 \cdot AD = \frac{AB (847 - x)}{x} (112 + x).$

We need another relation involving $AD$ and $AB.$

Consider $\triangle DPR \sim \triangle BPR.$  No.

Consider the intersection at $R.$
$\triangle PRD \sim \triangle CRB.$
$\frac{PR}{CR} = \frac{PD}{CB} = \frac{RD}{RB}.$
$\frac{847}{x} = \frac{PA + AD}{AD}.$
$847 \cdot AD = x (PA + AD) = x \cdot PA + x \cdot AD.$
$847 \cdot AD - x \cdot AD = x \cdot PA.$
$AD (847 - x) = x \cdot PA.$
$PA = \frac{AD (847 - x)}{x}.$

Equating the two expressions for $PA$:
$\frac{AB (847 - x)}{x} = \frac{AD (847 - x)}{x}.$
If $847 - x \neq 0,$ then $AB = AD.$
This means the parallelogram is a rhombus.

Case 1: $847 - x \neq 0.$
If the parallelogram is a rhombus, then $AB = AD.$
Substitute $AB = AD$ into the equations.
Equation 1: $735 \cdot AB = PA (112 + x).$
Equation 2: $847 \cdot AB = x (PA + AB).$

From Equation 2: $847 \cdot AB = x \cdot PA + x \cdot AB.$
$AB (847 - x) = x \cdot PA.$
$PA = \frac{AB (847 - x)}{x}.$

Substitute into Equation 1:
$735 \cdot AB = \frac{AB (847 - x)}{x} (112 + x).$
Since $AB \neq 0,$ we can divide by $AB.$
$735 = \frac{(847 - x)(112 + x)}{x}.$
$735x = (847 - x)(112 + x) = 847 \cdot 112 + 847x - 112x - x^2.$
$735x = 94864 + 735x - x^2.$
$0 = 94864 - x^2.$
$x^2 = 94864.$
$x = \sqrt{94864}.$

$94864 = 4 \times 23716 = 4 \times 4 \times 5929 = 16 \times 5929.$
$\sqrt{5929} = 77.$
$x = \sqrt{16 \times 77^2} = 4 \times 77 = 308.$

So, if $AB = AD,$ then $RC = x = 308.$

Case 2: $847 - x = 0,$ so $x = 847.$
Then $RC = 847.$
Equation 2: $847 \cdot AB = 847 (PA + AB).$
$AB = PA + AB,$ so $PA = 0.$
This contradicts the fact that $P$ is an extension of $DA.$

Let's assume the parallelogram is general.
From $\frac{AB (847 - x)}{x} = \frac{AD (847 - x)}{x},$ if $x \neq 847,$ then $AB = AD.$

Let's reconsider the problem without assuming $AB = AD.$

We have $PQ = 735, QR = 112.$
$PR = 847.$

Consider $\triangle PBC.$ The line $DB$ intersects the sides $PB, BC, CP.$
The intersections are $R$ on $PB,$ $D$ on the extension of $BC,$ $B$ on the extension of $CP.$  Incorrect.

Consider $\triangle PBC$ and the transversal $DBR.$
Points $D$ on line $BC,$ $R$ on line $PC,$ $B$ on line $PB.$
Menelaus' Theorem on $\triangle PBC$ with transversal $DBR$:
$\frac{CD}{DB} \cdot \frac{BR}{RP} \cdot \frac{PD}{DC} = 1.$  Incorrect application.

Consider $\triangle PBC$ and the transversal $DB.$
Points $D$ on $BC,$ $R$ on $PC.$

Let's use vector approach or coordinate geometry.

Consider ratios of segments on the line $PC.$
$\frac{PQ}{QC} = \frac{PA}{BC} = \frac{PA}{AD}.$
$\frac{735}{112 + RC} = \frac{PA}{AD}.$

$\frac{PR}{RC} = \frac{PB}{DC} = \frac{PA + AB}{AB}.$
$\frac{847}{RC} = \frac{PA + AB}{AB}.$

Let $RC = y.$
$\frac{735}{112 + y} = \frac{PA}{AD}.$
$735 AD = PA (112 + y).$

$\frac{847}{y} = \frac{PA + AB}{AB} = \frac{PA}{AB} + 1.$
$\frac{847}{y} - 1 = \frac{PA}{AB}.$
$\frac{847 - y}{y} = \frac{PA}{AB}.$
$PA = AB \frac{847 - y}{y}.$

Substitute $PA$ into the first equation:
$735 AD = AB \frac{847 - y}{y} (112 + y).$

We need another relation.
Consider the intersection at $Q.$
$\triangle PAQ \sim \triangle CBQ.$
$\frac{PQ}{QC} = \frac{AQ}{BQ}.$
$\frac{735}{112 + y} = \frac{AQ}{AB - AQ}.$
$735 (AB - AQ) = AQ (112 + y).$
$735 AB - 735 AQ = 112 AQ + y AQ.$
$735 AB = AQ (735 + 112 + y) = AQ (847 + y).$
$AQ = \frac{735 AB}{847 + y}.$

Final check: If the parallelogram is a rhombus, $AB = AD.$
Then $735 = \frac{(847 - RC)(112 + RC)}{RC}.$
$735 RC = (847 - RC)(112 + RC).$
$735 RC = 94864 + 847 RC - 112 RC - RC^2.$
$735 RC = 94864 + 735 RC - RC^2.$
$0 = 94864 - RC^2.$
$RC^2 = 94864.$
$RC = 308.$

$\frac{847}{y} = \frac{PA + AB}{AB} = \frac{PA}{AB} + 1.$
$\frac{847}{y} - 1 = \frac{PA}{AB}.$
$\frac{847 - y}{y} = \frac{PA}{AB}.$
$PA = AB \frac{847 - y}{y}.$</text>
