Problem:
Freddy the frog is jumping around the coordinate plane searching for a river, which lies on the horizontal line $y = 24$ . A fence is located at the horizontal line $y = 0$ . On each jump Freddy randomly chooses a direction parallel to one of the coordinate axes and moves one unit in that direction. When he is at a point where $y=0$ , with equal likelihoods he chooses one of three directions where he either jumps parallel to the fence or jumps away from the fence, but he never chooses the direction that would have him cross over the fence to where $y < 0$ . Freddy starts his search at the point $(0, 21)$ and will stop once he reaches a point on the river. Find the expected number of jumps it will take Freddy to reach the river.

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem about Freddy the frog. Hmm, so Freddy starts at (0, 21) and needs to reach the river at y = 24. There's a fence at y = 0 that he can't go below. Each jump is one unit in a direction parallel to an axis, and when he's at y = 0, he can't go down, so he has three choices instead of four. We need to find the expected number of jumps for him to reach the river. 

First, I think this is a 2D random walk problem with absorption at y = 24 and a reflecting boundary at y = 0. The x-coordinate might complicate things, but maybe it doesn't matter? Because Freddy can move along the x-axis freely, but the river is the entire line y = 24, regardless of x. So actually, maybe the x-coordinate is irrelevant. Because once Freddy reaches y = 24, regardless of his x-position, he's done. So maybe we can ignore the x-coordinate and think of this as a 1D problem along the y-axis? 

Wait, but Freddy can move left or right as well as up or down. However, if he moves left or right, his y-coordinate doesn't change. If we can show that the expected number of steps isn't affected by horizontal movement, then maybe the problem reduces to a 1D walk along the y-axis. Or maybe not. Let's think.

Suppose Freddy moves left or right; since the river is an entire horizontal line, moving left or right doesn't bring him closer or further from the river. So such moves only contribute to the number of steps but don't change his y-position. So essentially, if he moves left or right, it's like staying in the same y-state. So in terms of the expected number of steps to reach y=24, perhaps these horizontal moves can be factored out? Maybe, but how?

Alternatively, maybe instead of thinking in 2D, since horizontal moves don't affect the y-coordinate, the problem is equivalent to Freddy sometimes taking steps that don't change his y-coordinate (when he moves left/right) and sometimes changing his y-coordinate (when he moves up/down). But on the fence at y=0, he can't go down, so when he's at y=0, the probability distribution of his moves is different.

Wait, when Freddy is at a general position (x, y) not on the fence (so y > 0), how many directions can he move? The problem states: "on each jump Freddy randomly chooses a direction parallel to one of the coordinate axes and moves one unit in that direction." So in other words, from any point (x, y) where y > 0, he can go up, down, left, or right, each with probability 1/4. But when he is at a point where y = 0, he can't go down, so he chooses with equal likelihoods from three directions: up, left, or right. Each with probability 1/3.

The river is at y = 24, so once he reaches any point with y = 24, he stops. We need the expected number of steps starting from (0, 21) until he reaches y = 24. So, given the horizontal moves don't affect the y-coordinate, maybe we can model this as a 1D Markov chain on the y-coordinate, with transitions affected by the horizontal steps.

But how do horizontal steps factor into the expectation? Let’s consider for a moment that whenever Freddy makes a horizontal move, he stays in the same y-state. So, if he is at a state y (except y=0), with probability 1/2 he moves left or right (these are "wasted" steps in terms of progressing towards the river), and with probability 1/4 he moves up or down (but at y=0, he can't move down). Wait, no, in each jump, he chooses a direction parallel to one of the coordinate axes—so there are four directions: up, down, left, right. So, from any point not on the fence, he has four possible directions, each with probability 1/4. So 1/4 up, 1/4 down, 1/4 left, 1/4 right. So vertical movement (up or down) is 1/2 probability, left/right is 1/2 probability. But since left/right don't affect the y-coordinate, perhaps we can model the y-coordinate separately.

Another approach: Let’s let E(y) be the expected number of steps to reach the river from a y-coordinate y, regardless of x. Since the x-coordinate doesn't matter, maybe E(y) is the same no matter what x is, so we can just model E(y). 

Then, starting from y, the frog can either move up, down, left, or right. Moving left or right leaves him in the same y-coordinate, so he still has expectation E(y). Moving up takes him to y+1, moving down takes him to y-1. However, at y=0, moving down is not allowed, so the frog can only move up, left, or right. 

Therefore, for y > 0, the expected number of steps E(y) satisfies:

E(y) = 1 + (1/4)E(y+1) + (1/4)E(y-1) + (2/4)E(y)

Similarly, at y=0, the expected steps E(0) satisfy:

E(0) = 1 + (1/3)E(1) + (2/3)E(0)

And the boundary condition is E(24) = 0, since once he's at the river, he stops.

Okay, so let me verify the equations.

For y > 0:

Each step, he has 1/4 chance to move up to y+1, 1/4 down to y-1, and 1/2 chance to stay at y (left/right). Therefore:

E(y) = 1 + (1/4)E(y+1) + (1/4)E(y-1) + (1/2)E(y)

Which we can rearrange as:

E(y) - (1/2)E(y) = 1 + (1/4)E(y+1) + (1/4)E(y-1)

Multiplying both sides by 2:

E(y) = 2 + (1/2)E(y+1) + (1/2)E(y-1)

So:

(1/2)E(y+1) - E(y) + (1/2)E(y-1) = -2

Which is a linear recurrence relationship with constant coefficients.

Similarly, at y=0:

E(0) = 1 + (1/3)E(1) + (2/3)E(0)

Subtract (2/3)E(0) from both sides:

(1/3)E(0) = 1 + (1/3)E(1)

Multiply both sides by 3:

E(0) = 3 + E(1)

So, that's the equation for y=0.

So now, we have a system of equations for E(y), with E(24) = 0, and for 1 ≤ y ≤ 23:

(1/2)E(y+1) - E(y) + (1/2)E(y-1) = -2

At y=0:

E(0) = 3 + E(1)

This is similar to a nonhomogeneous linear difference equation. Let me recall how to solve such equations. The homogeneous equation is:

(1/2)E(y+1) - E(y) + (1/2)E(y-1) = 0

The characteristic equation would be (1/2)r^2 - r + (1/2) = 0, which multiplies by 2:

r^2 - 2r + 1 = 0 => (r-1)^2=0, so root r=1 with multiplicity 2. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is E_h(y) = A + By.

For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (-2), let's try a quadratic function, say E_p(y) = Cy^2. Then:

(1/2)[C(y+1)^2] - C y^2 + (1/2)[C(y-1)^2] = -2

Compute left-hand side:

(1/2)C[(y+1)^2 + (y-1)^2] - C y^2

= (1/2)C[(y^2 + 2y +1 + y^2 - 2y +1)] - C y^2

= (1/2)C[2y^2 + 2] - C y^2

= C(y^2 +1) - C y^2 = C

Set equal to -2:

C = -2

Hence, the general solution is E(y) = A + By - 2y^2.

But let's check. Wait, we found that E_p(y) = -2y^2, but substituting into the equation:

E_p(y) = -2y^2:

Left hand side:

(1/2)E_p(y+1) - E_p(y) + (1/2)E_p(y-1)

= (1/2)(-2)(y+1)^2 - (-2y^2) + (1/2)(-2)(y-1)^2

= - (y+1)^2 + 2y^2 - (y -1)^2

= - [y^2 + 2y +1] + 2y^2 - [y^2 - 2y +1]

= -y^2 -2y -1 + 2y^2 -y^2 +2y -1

= (-y^2 +2y^2 -y^2) + (-2y +2y) + (-1 -1)

= 0 + 0 -2 = -2. 

Yes, that works. So the particular solution is E_p(y) = -2 y^2.

Therefore, general solution is overall:

E(y) = A + By + Cy^2 (homogeneous + particular).

Wait, wait no. The homogeneous solution is E_h(y)= A + By. The particular solution is E_p(y)= -2 y^2. So the total solution is E(y) = A + By -2 y^2.

We need boundary conditions to solve for A and B.

First, the boundary conditions we have are:

1. E(24) = 0.

2. At y=0: E(0) = 3 + E(1).

So plug y=24 into E(y):

A + B*24 -2*(24)^2 = 0

A +24B - 1152 = 0 --> Equation (1): A +24B = 1152

Also, let's write E(0) = A +B*0 -2*0 = A.

And E(1) = A + B*1 -2*1 = A + B -2.

From the condition at y=0: E(0)=3 + E(1) => A = 3 + (A + B -2) => A =3 + A + B -2 => A = A + B +1

Subtract A from both sides: 0 = B +1 => B= -1.

Then, from Equation (1): A +24*(-1) =1152 => A -24=1152 => A=1152 +24=1176.

Therefore, the expected number of steps is:

E(y) =1176 - y -2 y^2.

Wait, so let's plug in y=21: E(21) =1176 -21 -2*(21)^2= 1176 -21 -2*441= 1176 -21 -882= (1176 -21)=1155; 1155 -882=273.

So the answer is 273? Hmm, but let's check if our solution works for other values.

Wait, in our relation, before considering the boundary at y=0, but we have derived the general solution E(y)=1176 - y -2y^2, and given that the recurrence at y=0 is E(0)=3+ E(1), does this hold with the given solution?

Check y=0: E(0)=1176 -0 -0=1176.

E(1)=1176 -1 -2*(1)^2=1176 -1 -2=1173.

Then 3 + E(1)= 3 +1173=1176=E(0). So that works.

Similarly, check the general recurrence for some y. Let's take y=1:

E(1) =1176 -1 -2=1173

According to the recurrence relation (for y>0):

(1/2)E(2) - E(1) + (1/2)E(0)= -2

E(2)=1176 -2 -2*4=1176 -2 -8=1166

So (1/2)*1166 -1173 + (1/2)*1176= 583 -1173 +588= (583+588) -1173= 1171 -1173= -2. Correct.

Similarly, if we take y=2:

(1/2)E(3) - E(2) + (1/2)E(1)=?

E(3)=1176 -3 -2*9=1176-3-18=1155

(1/2)*1155 -1166 + (1/2)*1173=577.5 -1166 +586.5= (577.5 +586.5)-1166=1164 -1166=-2. Correct.

Therefore, the solution seems to hold for y>=1.

Thus, plug y=21 into E(y)=1176 -y -2y2:

1176 -21 -2*(21)^2=1176 -21 -882= 1155 -882=273. So 273.

But before concluding, let's check if this model made sense.

But wait, the problem was in 2D, and we made it a 1D problem assuming that left/right moves don't affect the expectation. But, in reality, does that hold? Let's think again.

In 2D, he moves left or right with certain probabilities, but since left and right movements don't change the y-coordinate, which is the only thing that matters for absorption. When calculating expectation, whether he moves left or right just adds a step but doesn't progress towards the goal. So integrating over these steps, does the expectation E(y) indeed not depend on x?

Wait, actually, the answer could depend on x, because if he is very far to the left or right, in x-direction, but the river is at y=24 regardless of x, so actually movement along x is free, in the sense that he can take as many steps left/right without affecting the y-coordinate, which is the key.

But if we model it as 1D, then in 1D, when he is at y, he can go up, down, or "stay", but since in reality in 2D he can move left/right as well, which in the model are equivalent to staying in the same y-state. Therefore, the 1D model with certain probabilities is valid.

Wait, the original movement in 2D: from any y >0, he has four directions, each with probability 1/4, so two vertical (up/down) and two horizontal (left/right). Therefore, moving left/right corresponds to staying in the same y-state, each with probability 1/4. So total probability to stay in y is 2*(1/4)=1/2. To move up or down, each with probability 1/4.

But when we collapse it into a 1D model, the transition probabilities are: moving up with 1/4, moving down with 1/4, staying with 1/2. Which is the same as the vertical component. Therefore, collapsing to 1D (ignoring x-coordinate) is valid because the horizontal movements don't contribute to the y-state progression. 

Similarly, at y=0, he cannot move down, so two horizontal directions and up. So in 1D terms, moving up with probability 1/3 and staying with probability 2/3. So the equations we set up earlier are correct.

Hence, the answer is indeed 273. That seems right, but I want to verify with another approach.

Alternative way: the recurrence equation for y >0 is E(y) = 1 + (1/4)E(y+1) + (1/4)E(y-1) + (1/2)E(y). Rearranged: (E(y) - (1/2)E(y))=1 + (1/4)(E(y+1)+E(y-1)) => (1/2)E(y)=1 + (1/4)(E(y+1)+E(y-1)), then multiply by 4:

2E(y) =4 + E(y+1) + E(y-1)

Which leads to:

E(y+1) -2E(y) + E(y-1) = -4

For y ≥1. At y=0: E(0) =3 + E(1)

And E(24)=0.

This recurrence is a standard second-order linear difference equation. The homogeneous solution is A + B y, and the particular solution, because the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's use quadratic. Let me check.

Assume E(y) = a y2 + b y + c.

Then, plug into the recurrence equation (for y ≥1):

a(y+1)^2 + b(y+1) + c -2 [a y2 +b y +c] + a(y-1)^2 +b(y-1) +c = -4

Compute left-hand side:

a[(y+1)^2 + (y-1)^2 -2 y2] + b[(y+1) + (y-1) -2 y] + [c + c - 2 c +c]

First, expand each part:

For the a terms:

(y+1)^2 + (y-1)^2 -2 y2

= (y2 +2y +1) + (y2 -2y +1) -2 y2

= 2 y2 + 2 -2 y2

= 2

So the a term is 2 a.

For the b terms:

(y+1) + (y-1) -2 y

= (2 y) -2 y

= 0

So the b term is 0.

For the c terms:

c (from first term) + c (from fourth term) -2c + c (from third term)

Wait, sorry, expanding each term:

First term: a(y+1)^2 + b(y+1) +c

Second term: -2 [a y2 +b y +c] = -2a y2 -2b y -2c

Third term: a(y-1)^2 +b(y-1) +c

So combining all terms:

[a(y+1)^2 -2a y2 +a(y-1)^2] + [b(y+1) -2b y + b(y-1)] + [c -2c +c]

Which simplifies as above:

a[ (y+1)^2 + (y-1)^2 -2 y2 ] + b[ (y+1) -2 y + (y -1) ] + (c -2c +c)

Calculates:

a*2 + b*0 + 0=2a

Thus, 2a = -4 => a= -2

Thus, a quadratic particular solution is E_p(y) = -2 y2

Then the general solution is homogeneous (A +B y) plus particular (-2 y2):

E(y)= A + B y -2 y2

Same as before. Then applying boundary conditions:

1. E(24)=0 => A +24 B -2*(24)^2=0

2. For y=0: E(0)=A =3 + E(1)= 3 + (A +B*1 -2*(1)^2)=3 + (A +B -2)

Thus, A=3 + A +B -2

Simplify: 0=1 + B => B= -1

Therefore, from 1: A -24 -2*(576)=0 =>A=24 +1152=1176, thus as before.

E(y)=1176 - y -2 y2

At y=21: 1176 -21 -2*441=1176-21-882=273.

So yes, same answer, which increases my confidence.

Alternatively, let's check for another y, like y=23:

E(23)= 1176 -23 -2*(23)^2= 1176 -23 -1058=1153 -1058=95.

Then from 23, you would need 95 steps on average. Does that make sense? From 23, each step you have 1/4 chance to reach the river in one step (moving up), 1/4 chance to go to 22, 1/2 chance staying. Let's check:

E(23) should equal 1 + (1/4)*0 + (1/4)*E(22) + (1/2)*E(23)

So 1 + (1/4)*E(22) + (1/2)*E(23) = E(23)

Which gives:

1 + (1/4)*E(22)= (1/2)*E(23)

Multiply both sides by 4:

4 + E(22) =2 E(23)

Thus:

E(22)=2 E(23) -4

Given that E(23)=95, E(22)=2*95 -4=190-4=186.

From our formula: E(22)=1176 -22 -2*222=1176-22-968=1154-968=186. Which checks out.

Similarly, if we check E(1):

E(1)=1176 -1 -2=1173. 

Which corresponds to the calculation at y=1:

E(1) should be 1 + (1/4) E(2) + (1/4) E(0) + (1/2) E(1)

Compute RHS: 1 + (1/4)*1166 + (1/4)*1176 + (1/2)*1173

Calculate:

1 + 291.5 + 294 + 586.5

= 1 + 291.5=292.5; 292.5 +294=586.5; 586.5 +586.5=1173. 

Which equals E(1)=1173. Correct.

So all these checks out. Therefore, seems correct that E(21)=273.

Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{273}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{273}

<explanation>The solver is meticulously verifying their particular solution by substituting it back into the difference equation and confirming that it satisfies the equation. This shows careful application of difference equation solving techniques and attention to detail.</explanation>

<skill>Boundary Condition Application</skill>
<definition>The ability to apply boundary or initial conditions to determine specific constants in a general solution, thereby obtaining the particular solution relevant to the problem.</definition>

<start>6063</start>
<end>6427</end>
<text>We need boundary conditions to solve for A and B.

First, the boundary conditions we have are:

1. E(24) = 0.

2. At y=0: E(0) = 3 + E(1).

So plug y=24 into E(y):

A + B*24 -2*(24)^2 = 0

A +24B - 1152 = 0 --> Equation (1): A +24B = 1152

Also, let's write E(0) = A +B*0 -2*0 = A.

And E(1) = A + B*1 -2*1 = A + B -2.

From the condition at y=0: E(0)=3 + E(1) => A = 3 + (A + B -2) => A =3 + A + B -2 => A = A + B +1</text>
<explanation>The solver is applying the boundary conditions to determine the constants A and B in their general solution. They carefully substitute the boundary values into their solution formula and set up equations to solve for the constants.</explanation>

<start>6428</start>
<end>6599</end>
<text>Subtract A from both sides: 0 = B +1 => B= -1.

Then, from Equation (1): A +24*(-1) =1152 => A -24=1152 => A=1152 +24=1176.</text>
<explanation>The solver is solving the system of equations derived from the boundary conditions to find the specific values of the constants A and B, completing the determination of the particular solution relevant to the problem.</explanation>

<skill>Solution Verification</skill>
<definition>The ability to check the correctness of a solution by testing it against the original problem conditions, boundary cases, or through alternative solution methods.</definition>

<start>6785</start>
<end>7051</end>
<text>Wait, in our relation, before considering the boundary at y=0, but we have derived the general solution E(y)=1176 - y -2y^2, and given that the recurrence at y=0 is E(0)=3+ E(1), does this hold with the given solution?

Check y=0: E(0)=1176 -0 -0=1176.

E(1)=1176 -1 -2*(1)^2=1176 -1 -2=1173.

Then 3 + E(1)= 3 +1173=1176=E(0). So that works.</text>
<explanation>The solver is verifying that their solution satisfies the boundary condition at y=0, demonstrating careful validation of their work.</explanation>

<start>7052</start>
<end>7404</end>
<text>Similarly, check the general recurrence for some y. Let's take y=1:

E(1) =1176 -1 -2=1173

According to the recurrence relation (for y>0):

(1/2)E(y+1) - E(1) + (1/2)E(0)= -2

E(2)=1176 -2 -2*4=1176 -2 -8=1166

So (1/2)*1166 -1173 + (1/2)*1176= 583 -1173 +588= (583+588) -1173= 1171 -1173= -2. Correct.</text>
<explanation>The solver is checking that their solution satisfies the general recurrence relation at specific values, providing additional verification of the correctness of their solution.</explanation>

<start>11232</start>
<end>11718</end>
<text>Alternatively, let's check for another y, like y=23:

E(23)= 1176 -23 -2*(23)^2= 1176 -23 -1058=1153 -1058=95.

Then from 23, you would need 95 steps on average. Does that make sense? From 23, each step you have 1/4 chance to reach the river in one step (moving up), 1/4 chance to go to 22, 1/2 chance staying. Let's check:

E(23) should equal 1 + (1/4)*0 + (1/4)*E(22) + (1/2)*E(23)

So 1 + (1/4)*E(22) + (1/2)*E(23) = E(23)

Which gives:

1 + (1/4)*E(22)= (1/2)*E(23)</text>
<explanation>The solver is performing another verification by checking their solution at y=23, a point close to the boundary. They're reasoning through what the expected number of steps should be based on the original recurrence relation and confirming that their formula gives the correct result.</explanation>

<skill>Alternative Solution Approach</skill>
<definition>The ability to solve a problem using different methods or perspectives, which can provide verification of the solution and deeper understanding of the problem structure.</definition>

<start>9999</start>
<end>10506</end>
<text>Alternative way: the recurrence equation for y >0 is E(y) = 1 + (1/4)E(y+1) + (1/4)E(y-1) + (1/2)E(y). Rearranged: (E(y) - (1/2)E(y))=1 + (1/4)(E(y+1)+E(y-1)) => (1/2)E(y)=1 + (1/4)(E(y+1)+E(y-1)), then multiply by 4:

2E(y) =4 + E(y+1) + E(y-1)

Which leads to:

E(y+1) -2E(y) + E(y-1) = -4

For y ≥1. At y=0: E(0) =3 + E(1)

And E(24)=0.

This recurrence is a standard second-order linear difference equation. The homogeneous solution is A + B y, and the particular solution, because the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's use quadratic.</text>
<explanation>The solver is approaching the problem from a slightly different angle, rearranging the recurrence relation into a more standard form. This demonstrates flexibility in problem-solving and provides a way to verify the previous solution.</explanation>

<start>10507</start>
<end>11071</end>
<text>Let me check.

Assume E(y) = a y2 + b y + c.

Then, plug into the recurrence equation (for y ≥1):

a(y+1)^2 + b(y+1) + c -2 [a y2 +b y +c] + a(y-1)^2 +b(y-1) +c = -4

Compute left-hand side:

a[(y+1)^2 + (y-1)^2 -2 y2] + b[(y+1) + (y-1) -2 y] + [c + c - 2 c +c]

First, expand each part:

For the a terms:

(y+1)^2 + (y-1)^2 -2 y2

= (y2 +2y +1) + (y2 -2y +1) -2 y2

= 2 y2 + 2 -2 y2

= 2</text>
<explanation>The solver is using an alternative method to find the particular solution, assuming a quadratic form and verifying it by direct substitution. This provides additional confidence in the solution and demonstrates versatility in problem-solving approaches.</explanation>
