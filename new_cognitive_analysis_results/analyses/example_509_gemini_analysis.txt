Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the radius of a sphere that passes through the five vertices of a given right square pyramid. We are given the volume of the pyramid and the side length of its square base.

Let the right square pyramid have a base $ABCD$ and apex $E$. The base is a square with side length $6$. The vertices of the base are, say, $A=(3, -3, 0)$, $B=(3, 3, 0)$, $C=(-3, 3, 0)$, $D=(-3, -3, 0)$ in a suitable coordinate system where the base lies in the $xy$-plane and the center of the base is at the origin.

The area of the base is $6^2 = 36$.
The volume of the pyramid is given by $V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height}$.
We have $54 = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 \times h$, where $h$ is the height of the pyramid.
$54 = 12h$, so $h = \frac{54}{12} = \frac{27}{6} = \frac{9}{2}$.

The apex $E$ of the pyramid lies directly above the center of the base, which is the origin $(0, 0, 0)$.
The coordinates of the apex are $(0, 0, h) = (0, 0, \frac{9}{2})$.

The five vertices of the pyramid are:
$A=(3, -3, 0)$
$B=(3, 3, 0)$
$C=(-3, 3, 0)$
$D=(-3, -3, 0)$
$E=(0, 0, \frac{9}{2})$

We are looking for a sphere that passes through these five points. Let the center of the sphere be $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and its radius be $R$. The equation of the sphere is $(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 = R^2$.

Since the four base vertices lie on the sphere, they are equidistant from the center of the sphere. The center of the base is $(0, 0, 0)$.
Due to the symmetry of the base, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the sphere's center must be $0$, i.e., $x_0 = 0$ and $y_0 = 0$.
So, the center of the sphere lies on the $z$-axis, and the center is of the form $(0, 0, z_0)$.

The equation of the sphere becomes $x^2 + y^2 + (z-z_0)^2 = R^2$.

Consider one of the base vertices, say $A=(3, -3, 0)$. Substituting into the sphere equation:
$3^2 + (-3)^2 + (0-z_0)^2 = R^2$
$9 + 9 + z_0^2 = R^2$
$18 + z_0^2 = R^2 \quad (*)$

Now consider the apex $E=(0, 0, \frac{9}{2})$. Substituting into the sphere equation:
$0^2 + 0^2 + (\frac{9}{2}-z_0)^2 = R^2$
$(\frac{9}{2}-z_0)^2 = R^2 \quad (**)$

Equating $(*)$ and $(**)$:
$18 + z_0^2 = (\frac{9}{2}-z_0)^2$
$18 + z_0^2 = (\frac{9}{2})^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{9}{2} \cdot z_0 + z_0^2$
$18 + z_0^2 = \frac{81}{4} - 9z_0 + z_0^2$

The $z_0^2$ terms cancel out:
$18 = \frac{81}{4} - 9z_0$
$9z_0 = \frac{81}{4} - 18 = \frac{81}{4} - \frac{72}{4} = \frac{9}{4}$
$9z_0 = \frac{9}{4}$
$z_0 = \frac{1}{4}$

Now we can find $R^2$ using equation $(*)$:
$R^2 = 18 + z_0^2 = 18 + (\frac{1}{4})^2 = 18 + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{288}{16} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{289}{16}$

The radius of the sphere is $R = \sqrt{\frac{289}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{289}}{\sqrt{16}} = \frac{17}{4}$.

The radius of the sphere is $\frac{17}{4}$. We are given that the radius is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.
So, $m = 17$ and $n = 4$.
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime since $\text{gcd}(17, 4) = 1$.

We need to find $m+n = 17 + 4 = 21$.

Let's double-check the calculations.

Alternative approach:
Consider the circumsphere of the pyramid. The center of the circumsphere is equidistant from all five vertices.
Let the center be $(0, 0, z_0)$.
Distance from center to a base vertex (e.g., A):
$\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (-3-0)^2 + (0-z_0)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9 + z_0^2} = \sqrt{18 + z_0^2}$

Distance from center to the apex E:
$\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (\frac{9}{2}-z_0)^2} = \sqrt{(\frac{9}{2}-z_0)^2} = |\frac{9}{2}-z_0|$

Equating the squares of these distances:
$18 + z_0^2 = (\frac{9}{2}-z_0)^2$
$18 + z_0^2 = \frac{81}{4} - 9z_0 + z_0^2$
$18 = \frac{81}{4} - 9z_0$
$9z_0 = \frac{81}{4} - 18 = \frac{81 - 72}{4} = \frac{9}{4}$
$z_0 = \frac{1}{4}$

The radius of the sphere is the distance from the center to any vertex. Let's use a base vertex.
$R = \sqrt{18 + z_0^2} = \sqrt{18 + (\frac{1}{4})^2} = \sqrt{18 + \frac{1}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{288+1}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{289}{16}} = \frac{17}{4}$.

So, $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{17}{4}$, which gives $m=17, n=4$.
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, $17$ is prime, so $\text{gcd}(17, 4) = 1$.
$m+n = 17+4 = 21$.

General case:
Consider a right pyramid with a regular polygonal base centered at the origin in the $xy$-plane. Let the height of the pyramid be $h$. The apex is at $(0, 0, h)$.
The vertices of the base lie on a circle $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ in the $xy$-plane, where $r$ is the distance from the center of the base to a vertex.

For our square base with side length $6$, the distance from the center to a vertex is $\sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9+9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$.
So, the vertices of the base are at distance $3\sqrt{2}$ from the origin.

Let the circumsphere have center $(0, 0, z_0)$ and radius $R$.
Distance from center to a base vertex: $\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + (0-z_0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z_0^2}$.
Since $x^2 + y^2 = (3\sqrt{2})^2 = 18$, the distance is $\sqrt{18 + z_0^2}$.

Distance from center to the apex: $\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (h-z_0)^2} = |h-z_0|$.

Equating the squares of these distances:
$18 + z_0^2 = (h-z_0)^2 = h^2 - 2hz_0 + z_0^2$
$18 = h^2 - 2hz_0$
$2hz_0 = h^2 - 18$
$z_0 = \frac{h^2 - 18}{2h}$

In our case, $h = \frac{9}{2}$.
$z_0 = \frac{(\frac{9}{2})^2 - 18}{2 \cdot \frac{9}{2}} = \frac{\frac{81}{4} - 18}{9} = \frac{\frac{81 - 72}{4}}{9} = \frac{\frac{9}{4}}{9} = \frac{9}{4 \cdot 9} = \frac{1}{4}$.
This matches the previous result for $z_0$.

Now, the radius squared $R^2 = 18 + z_0^2 = 18 + (\frac{1}{4})^2 = 18 + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{289}{16}$.
$R = \frac{17}{4}$.

Consider the geometry of the problem. The center of the circumsphere must lie on the axis of symmetry of the pyramid, which is the line passing through the apex and the center of the base (the $z$-axis in our coordinate system).

Let the center of the sphere be $S = (0, 0, z_0)$.
The distance from $S$ to a base vertex is equal to the distance from $S$ to the apex.
Let a base vertex be $A = (3, -3, 0)$ and the apex be $E = (0, 0, \frac{9}{2})$.
$SA^2 = (3-0)^2 + (-3-0)^2 + (0-z_0)^2 = 9 + 9 + z_0^2 = 18 + z_0^2$.
$SE^2 = (0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (\frac{9}{2}-z_0)^2 = (\frac{9}{2}-z_0)^2$.

Equating $SA^2$ and $SE^2$:
$18 + z_0^2 = (\frac{9}{2}-z_0)^2$
$18 + z_0^2 = \frac{81}{4} - 9z_0 + z_0^2$
$18 = \frac{81}{4} - 9z_0$
$9z_0 = \frac{81}{4} - 18 = \frac{9}{4}$
$z_0 = \frac{1}{4}$.

The radius of the circumsphere is the distance from the center $S=(0, 0, \frac{1}{4})$ to any of the vertices.
Using a base vertex $A=(3, -3, 0)$:
$R = SA = \sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (-3-0)^2 + (0-\frac{1}{4})^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9 + \frac{1}{16}} = \sqrt{18 + \frac{1}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{288+1}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{289}{16}} = \frac{17}{4}$.

Using the apex $E=(0, 0, \frac{9}{2})$:
$R = SE = \sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (\frac{9}{2}-\frac{1}{4})^2} = \sqrt{(\frac{18-1}{4})^2} = \sqrt{(\frac{17}{4})^2} = \frac{17}{4}$.

The radius of the sphere is $\frac{17}{4}$.
We are given that the radius is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.
$m = 17$, $n = 4$.
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, $\text{gcd}(17, 4) = 1$.
We need to find $m+n = 17 + 4 = 21$.

Final check of the problem statement and question:
- Right square pyramid with volume $54$.
- Base with side length $6$.
- Five vertices lie on a sphere with radius $\frac{m}{n}$.
- $m, n$ are relatively prime positive integers.
- Find $m+n$.

Calculations:
- Base area = $36$.
- Volume = $\frac{1}{3} \times 36 \times h = 12h = 54 \implies h = \frac{54}{12} = \frac{9}{2}$.
- Vertices: $(3, \pm 3, 0)$, $(-3, \pm 3, 0)$, $(0, 0, \frac{9}{2})$.
- Center of circumsphere: $(0, 0, z_0)$.
- Distance from center to base vertex = $\sqrt{18 + z_0^2}$.
- Distance from center to apex = $|\frac{9}{2} - z_0|$.
- $18 + z_0^2 = (\frac{9}{2} - z_0)^2 \implies z_0 = \frac{1}{4}$.
- Radius $R = \sqrt{18 + (\frac{1}{4})^2} = \frac{17}{4}$.
- $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{17}{4}$, $m=17, n=4$.
- $m, n$ are relatively prime.
- $m+n = 17+4 = 21$.

The solution seems consistent and the calculations are straightforward.
Consider potential pitfalls: calculation errors, misunderstanding the geometry, or incorrect setup of the coordinate system. The choice of coordinate system simplifies the problem due to symmetry.

The problem relies on finding the circumsphere of the pyramid. The center of this sphere is equidistant from all five vertices. By exploiting the symmetry, we simplified the center to lie on the $z$-axis.

The calculation of the height of the pyramid is crucial and directly follows from the volume formula. The coordinates of the vertices are determined by the base dimensions and the height. The equation of the sphere and the condition that the vertices lie on it lead to the solution.
