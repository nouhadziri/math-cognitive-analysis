*1977 Keio University entrance exam/Medicine*

Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to find a continuous function f(x) that satisfies this integral equation:

∫0x sin t · f(x - t) dt = f(x) - sin x for any real number x.

Hmm, integral equations can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can manipulate this or use some known techniques. Let me think. The integral here looks like a convolution because it's ∫0x sin(t) f(x - t) dt. Convolutions often relate to Laplace transforms, especially in differential equations. Since we're dealing with an integral equation involving convolution, maybe taking the Laplace transform of both sides might simplify things.

Let me recall: the Laplace transform of a convolution is the product of the Laplace transforms. So, if I denote L{f}(s) as F(s) and L{sin t}(s) as something else, then maybe I can solve for F(s) and inverse transform it.

Let me verify. The Laplace transform of ∫0x g(t) h(x - t) dt is G(s) H(s). So yes, convolution in time domain becomes multiplication in Laplace domain. So maybe this is the way to go.

But first, let me check if this is a Volterra integral equation. It is of the second kind because f(x) is outside the integral. The general form is f(x) = g(x) + ∫0x K(x, t) f(t) dt. In our case, it's:

∫0x sin t · f(x - t) dt = f(x) - sin x

So rearranging, f(x) = sin x + ∫0x sin t · f(x - t) dt

So yes, it's a Volterra integral equation of the second kind with kernel K(x, t) = sin t (but since it's convolution, it's actually K(x - t) = sin t in this case). So using Laplace transforms might help.

Yes, that seems promising. Let me recall the Laplace transform of sin t is 1/(s2 + 1). Also, since we’re dealing with convolution, the transform of the integral ∫0x sin(t) f(x - t) dt is F(s) * L{sin t}(s) = F(s)/(s2 + 1).

So taking Laplace transform of both sides:

LHS: L{∫0x sin t · f(x - t) dt} = F(s) * (1/(s2 + 1))

RHS: L{f(x) - sin x} = F(s) - 1/(s2 + 1)

So equating both sides:

F(s)/(s2 + 1) = F(s) - 1/(s2 + 1)

Okay, then we can solve for F(s):

F(s) = (F(s) - 1/(s2 +1 )) * (s2 + 1)

Wait, let's re-express:

F(s)/(s2 + 1) = F(s) - 1/(s2 + 1)

Multiply both sides by (s2 + 1):

F(s) = (s2 + 1) F(s) - 1

Then bring the F(s) term to the left:

F(s) - (s2 + 1) F(s) = -1

F(s) [1 - (s2 +1 )] = -1

Simplify:

F(s) [-s2] = -1

Divide both sides by -s2:

F(s) = (-1)/(-s2) = 1/s2

Oh, interesting. So the Laplace transform of f(x) is 1/s2. Then taking the inverse Laplace transform, f(x) is L^{-1} {1/s2} = x. So is the solution f(x) = x? Let's check if that works.

Let me test f(x) = x.

Left-hand side: ∫0x sin t · f(x - t) dt = ∫0x sin t · (x - t) dt

Let me compute this integral.

First, expand (x - t) = x - t, so integral becomes:

x ∫0x sin t dt - ∫0x t sin t dt

Compute each integral:

First integral: x ∫0x sin t dt = x [-cos t]0x = x [-cos x + cos 0] = x [-cos x +1] = x(1 - cos x)

Second integral: ∫0x t sin t dt. Integration by parts: let u = t, dv = sin t dt, then du = dt, v = -cos t.

So uv|0x - ∫0x v du = [-t cos t]0x + ∫0x cos t dt = [-x cos x + 0] + [sin t]0x = -x cos x + (sin x - 0) = -x cos x + sin x

Therefore, the integral becomes x(1 - cos x) - (-x cos x + sin x) = x - x cos x + x cos x - sin x = x - sin x

But then, according to the original equation, ∫0x sin t · f(x - t) dt = f(x) - sin x. If LHS is x - sin x, then f(x) - sin x equals x - sin x, which implies f(x) = x. So it does work! Therefore, the answer is f(x) = x.

Wait, but just to make sure, maybe there's another way to approach this problem, like differentiation.

Suppose we differentiate both sides with respect to x. Since the integral is from 0 to x, the derivative of the LHS is by Leibniz rule: sin x · f(x - x) + ∫0x sin t · f’(x - t) dt. But x - x = 0, so f(0). Wait, need to compute d/dx [∫0x sin t f(x - t) dt].

Let me make substitution u = x - t, then when t = 0, u = x; t = x, u = 0. So integral becomes ∫x0 sin (x - u) f(u) (-du) = ∫0x sin (x - u) f(u) du.

Then, if F(x) = ∫0x sin (x - u) f(u) du, then dF/dx = sin(x - x)f(x) + ∫0x d/dx [sin(x - u) f(u)] du = sin(0) f(x) + ∫0x cos(x - u) f(u) du = 0 + ∫0x cos(x - u) f(u) du

Therefore, derivative of the LHS is ∫0x cos(x - u) f(u) du.

Derivative of the RHS is f’(x) - cos x.

Therefore, equating:

∫0x cos(x - u) f(u) du = f’(x) - cos x.

Hmm, that gives another integral equation.

If f(x) = x, then f’(x) = 1. Let me check if this equation holds.

Compute LHS: ∫0x cos(x - u) * u du = substitute v = x - u, dv = -du, limits from u=0, v=x to u=x, v=0, so integral becomes ∫0x cos(v) (x - v) dv = similar to the previous integral.

Again, expand (x - v):

x ∫0x cos v dv - ∫0x v cos v dv.

Compute first integral: x [sin v]0x = x sin x.

Second integral: ∫0x v cos v dv. Integration by parts. Let u = v, dv = cos v du. Then du = dv, v = sin v. Wait:

Wait, better define: let u = v, dv = cos v dv, then du = dv, v = sin v. No, integration by parts:

∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du.

Let me set u = v => du = dv; dv = cos v dv => v = sin v.

Wait, notation conflict. Let's rewrite.

Let me set u = v, then du = dv. What's dv? The dv is cos v dv, meaning ∫ cos v dv = sin v. So more precisely:

Let u = v => du = dv.

Let dw = cos v dv => w = sin v.

Then ∫ v cos v dv = v sin v - ∫ sin v dv = v sin v + cos v + C.

Therefore, ∫0x v cos v dv = [v sin v + cos v]0x = x sin x + cos x - [0 + cos 0] = x sin x + cos x - 1

Therefore, LHS integral is x sin x - (x sin x + cos x -1 ) = x sin x -x sin x - cos x +1 = 1 - cos x.

Then according to the equation obtained by differentiating both sides:

1 - cos x = f’(x) - cos x => 1 - cos x + cos x = f’(x) => 1 = f’(x).

Therefore, f’(x) =1, which implies f(x) =x + C.

But if f(x) = x + C, then check original integral equation.

Let’s check f(x) = x + C:

LHS: ∫0x sin t f(x - t) dt = ∫0x sin t (x - t + C) dt = ∫0x sin t (x + C - t) dt

= (x + C) ∫0x sin t dt - ∫0x t sin t dt

Compute each part:

First integral: (x + C)(-cos x +1 ) as before.

Second integral: same as before, which was -x cos x + sin x.

Therefore, entire LHS: (x + C)(1 - cos x) - (-x cos x + sin x) = x(1 - cos x) + C(1 - cos x) + x cos x - sin x

= x - x cos x + C - C cos x + x cos x - sin x = x + C - C cos x - sin x

RHS: f(x) - sin x = (x + C) - sin x

Set equal:

x + C - C cos x - sin x = x + C - sin x

Subtract x + C - sin x from both sides:

- C cos x =0

This must hold for all x. The only way for this to hold is if C =0. Hence, f(x) =x.

Indeed, that's consistent with the previous result. So f(x)=x is the solution. So after checking by substitution into the original equation and verification via differentiation leading to f’(x)=1, we confirm that the solution is f(x)=x.

Alternatively, since after taking Laplace transform we obtained F(s)=1/s2 implying f(x)=x, which is continuous as required. Thus, this is indeed the solution.

**Final Answer**
The continuous function is \boxed{x}.
