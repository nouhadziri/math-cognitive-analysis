Problem:
B.4 If $\Delta E_{r m s}=5.54 \times 10^{-17} \mathrm{~J}$, calculate the rms speed of the Be nuclei, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{Be}}$, and hence estimate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$. (Hint: $\Delta E_{r m s}$ depends on the rms value of the component of velocity along the line of sight).

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let's break down the problem and the thought process to solve it.

**1. Understanding the Problem**

The problem gives us the root-mean-square (rms) energy spread of Be nuclei ($\Delta E_{rms}$) and asks us to calculate the rms speed of these nuclei ($V_{Be}$) and then estimate the temperature ($T_c$). The hint about the line of sight component is important.

**2. Identifying Relevant Formulas**

* **Kinetic Energy:**  The energy of motion is given by $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Since we are dealing with the *rms* energy, it makes sense to relate it to the *rms* speed.
* **Relationship between RMS Energy and RMS Speed:**  The rms energy spread is related to the spread in kinetic energy. If we consider a single particle, its kinetic energy is $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. For a collection of particles, the rms kinetic energy is related to the rms speed.
* **Relating Kinetic Energy to Temperature:**  In statistical mechanics, the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas is related to the temperature. Specifically, for each degree of freedom, the average kinetic energy is $\frac{1}{2}kT$, where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.

**3. Deconstructing the Hint**

The hint mentions the component of velocity along the line of sight. This is a crucial point. The energy spread is given for the motion along the line of sight, meaning we're dealing with a 1-dimensional situation in terms of the energy spread provided. Therefore, the kinetic energy associated with this spread is due to one component of the velocity.

**4. Setting up the Equations**

* **Relating $\Delta E_{rms}$ and $V_{Be, rms, line-of-sight}$:**  Since the energy spread is along the line of sight, we can write:
   $\Delta E_{rms} = \frac{1}{2} m_{Be} (V_{Be, rms, line-of-sight})^2$
   Here, $m_{Be}$ is the mass of a Be nucleus.

* **Relating $V_{Be, rms, line-of-sight}$ and $V_{Be, rms}$:** In a thermal distribution, the velocity components in the x, y, and z directions are independent and have the same rms value. So, if $V_{Be, rms, x}$ is the rms speed along the line of sight, then $V_{Be, rms, x} = V_{Be, rms, y} = V_{Be, rms, z}$. The total rms speed is given by:
   $V_{Be, rms}^2 = V_{Be, rms, x}^2 + V_{Be, rms, y}^2 + V_{Be, rms, z}^2 = 3 V_{Be, rms, line-of-sight}^2$
   Therefore, $V_{Be, rms} = \sqrt{3} V_{Be, rms, line-of-sight}$.

* **Relating $V_{Be, rms}$ and $T_c$:** The average kinetic energy in 3D is $\frac{3}{2}kT_c$. This is also equal to $\frac{1}{2} m_{Be} V_{Be, rms}^2$.
   So, $\frac{3}{2}kT_c = \frac{1}{2} m_{Be} V_{Be, rms}^2$.

**5. Step-by-Step Calculation**

* **Calculate the mass of a Be nucleus:**  Beryllium has an atomic number of 4. The most common isotope is Beryllium-9 ($^9$Be). The mass can be approximated as 9 atomic mass units (amu). Convert this to kg:
   $m_{Be} = 9 \text{ amu} \times 1.66054 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg/amu}$

* **Calculate $V_{Be, rms, line-of-sight}$:** Use the equation $\Delta E_{rms} = \frac{1}{2} m_{Be} (V_{Be, rms, line-of-sight})^2$ and solve for $V_{Be, rms, line-of-sight}$.

* **Calculate $V_{Be, rms}$:** Use the relation $V_{Be, rms} = \sqrt{3} V_{Be, rms, line-of-sight}$. *Self-correction*:  Initially, I might have thought the energy was the total kinetic energy, but the hint forces us to consider the one-dimensional case first.

* **Calculate $T_c$:** Use the equation $\frac{3}{2}kT_c = \frac{1}{2} m_{Be} V_{Be, rms}^2$ and solve for $T_c$. Remember the value of the Boltzmann constant, $k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K}$.

**6. Double-Checking and Refining**

* **Units:** Ensure all units are consistent throughout the calculation.
* **Reasonableness of the Result:** Does the calculated temperature seem physically plausible for nuclear fusion conditions?  Fusion requires extremely high temperatures (millions of Kelvin).
* **Re-reading the Hint:**  The hint about the line of sight is key. It directs us to use the 1D kinetic energy initially. If the hint wasn't there, we might have directly equated $\Delta E_{rms}$ to the total rms kinetic energy, which would be incorrect based on the phrasing.

**Simplified Approach (Realizing the Shortcut):**

After the initial setup, one might realize a more direct path. Since $\Delta E_{rms}$ is the rms energy *along the line of sight*, this directly corresponds to the kinetic energy associated with one degree of freedom. Therefore:

$\Delta E_{rms} = \frac{1}{2} m_{Be} (V_{Be, rms, line-of-sight})^2$

And for one degree of freedom, the average kinetic energy is also $\frac{1}{2} k T_c$. If we *assume* that the rms energy spread directly corresponds to this average kinetic energy for that one dimension, then:

$\Delta E_{rms} = \frac{1}{2} k T_c$

This bypasses the need to explicitly calculate $V_{Be, rms}$ first, if we interpret the problem statement in a particular way. However, the problem asks for $V_{Be}$ first, so the step-by-step approach is necessary to answer all parts.

By following these steps and considerations, we arrive at the correct solution. The key is careful reading of the problem statement, understanding the definitions of rms values, and applying the relevant formulas from kinetic theory.
