Problem:
Consider any rectangular table having finitely many rows and columns, with a real 

 number $a(r, c)$ in the cell in row $r$ and column $c$. A pair $(R, C)$, where $R$ is a set of rows and $C$ a set of columns, is called a saddle pair if the following two conditions are satisfied:(i) For each row $r^{\prime}$, there is $r \in R$ such that $a(r, c) \geqslant a\left(r^{\prime}, c\right)$ for all $c \in C$;

(ii) For each column $c^{\prime}$, there is $c \in C$ such that $a(r, c) \leqslant a\left(r, c^{\prime}\right)$ for all $r \in R$.

A saddle pair $(R, C)$ is called a minimal pair if for each saddle pair $\left(R^{\prime}, C^{\prime}\right)$ with $R^{\prime} \subseteq R$ and $C^{\prime} \subseteq C$, we have $R^{\prime}=R$ and $C^{\prime}=C$.

Prove that any two minimal pairs contain the same number of rows.

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
We say that a pair $\left(R^{\prime}, C^{\prime}\right)$ of nonempty sets is a subpair of a pair $(R, C)$ if $R^{\prime} \subseteq R$ and $C^{\prime} \subseteq C$. The subpair is proper if at least one of the inclusions is strict.

Let $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$ and $\left(R_{2}, C_{2}\right)$ be two saddle pairs with $\left|R_{1}\right|>\left|R_{2}\right|$. We will find a saddle subpair $\left(R^{\prime}, C^{\prime}\right)$ of $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$ with $\left|R^{\prime}\right| \leqslant\left|R_{2}\right|$; clearly, this implies the desired statement.

Step 1: We construct maps $\rho: R_{1} \rightarrow R_{1}$ and $\sigma: C_{1} \rightarrow C_{1}$ such that $\left|\rho\left(R_{1}\right)\right| \leqslant\left|R_{2}\right|$, and $a\left(\rho\left(r_{1}\right), c_{1}\right) \geqslant a\left(r_{1}, \sigma\left(c_{1}\right)\right)$ for all $r_{1} \in R_{1}$ and $c_{1} \in C_{1}$.

Since $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$ is a saddle pair, for each $r_{2} \in R_{2}$ there is $r_{1} \in R_{1}$ such that $a\left(r_{1}, c_{1}\right) \geqslant a\left(r_{2}, c_{1}\right)$ for all $c_{1} \in C_{1}$; denote one such an $r_{1}$ by $\rho_{1}\left(r_{2}\right)$. Similarly, we define four functions

$$
\begin{array}{llllll}
\rho_{1}: R_{2} \rightarrow R_{1} & \text { such that } & a\left(\rho_{1}\left(r_{2}\right), c_{1}\right) \geqslant a\left(r_{2}, c_{1}\right) & \text { for all } & r_{2} \in R_{2}, & c_{1} \in C_{1} ; \\
\rho_{2}: R_{1} \rightarrow R_{2} & \text { such that } & a\left(\rho_{2}\left(r_{1}\right), c_{2}\right) \geqslant a\left(r_{1}, c_{2}\right) & \text { for all } & r_{1} \in R_{1}, & c_{2} \in C_{2} ; \\
\sigma_{1}: C_{2} \rightarrow C_{1} & \text { such that } & a\left(r_{1}, \sigma_{1}\left(c_{2}\right)\right) \leqslant a\left(r_{1}, c_{2}\right) & \text { for all } & r_{1} \in R_{1}, & c_{2} \in C_{2} ; \\
\sigma_{2}: C_{1} \rightarrow C_{2} & \text { such that } & a\left(r_{2}, \sigma_{2}\left(c_{1}\right)\right) \leqslant a\left(r_{2}, c_{1}\right) & \text { for all } & r_{2} \in R_{2}, & c_{1} \in C_{1} .
\end{array}
\tag{1}
$$

Set now $\rho=\rho_{1} \circ \rho_{2}: R_{1} \rightarrow R_{1}$ and $\sigma=\sigma_{1} \circ \sigma_{2}: C_{1} \rightarrow C_{1}$. We have

$$
\left|\rho\left(R_{1}\right)\right|=\left|\rho_{1}\left(\rho_{2}\left(R_{1}\right)\right)\right| \leqslant\left|\rho_{1}\left(R_{2}\right)\right| \leqslant\left|R_{2}\right| .
$$

Moreover, for all $r_{1} \in R_{1}$ and $c_{1} \in C_{1}$, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a\left(\rho\left(r_{1}\right), c_{1}\right)=a\left(\rho_{1}\left(\rho_{2}\left(r_{1}\right)\right), c_{1}\right) \geqslant a\left(\rho_{2}\left(r_{1}\right), c_{1}\right) \geqslant a\left(\rho_{2}\left(r_{1}\right), \sigma_{2}\left(c_{1}\right)\right) \\
& \geqslant a\left(r_{1}, \sigma_{2}\left(c_{1}\right)\right) \geqslant a\left(r_{1}, \sigma_{1}\left(\sigma_{2}\left(c_{1}\right)\right)\right)=a\left(r_{1}, \sigma\left(c_{1}\right)\right)
\end{aligned}
\tag{2}
$$

as desired.

Step 2: Given maps $\rho$ and $\sigma$, we construct a proper saddle subpair $\left(R^{\prime}, C^{\prime}\right)$ of $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$.

The properties of $\rho$ and $\sigma$ yield that

$$
a\left(\rho^{i}\left(r_{1}\right), c_{1}\right) \geqslant a\left(\rho^{i-1}\left(r_{1}\right), \sigma\left(c_{1}\right)\right) \geqslant \ldots \geqslant a\left(r_{1}, \sigma^{i}\left(c_{1}\right)\right)
$$

for each positive integer $i$ and all $r_{1} \in R_{1}, c_{1} \in C_{1}$.

Consider the images $R^{i}=\rho^{i}\left(R_{1}\right)$ and $C^{i}=\sigma^{i}\left(C_{1}\right)$. Clearly, $R_{1}=R^{0} \supseteq R^{1} \supseteq R^{2} \supseteq \ldots$ and $C_{1}=C^{0} \supseteq C^{1} \supseteq C^{2} \supseteq \ldots$. Since both chains consist of finite sets, there is an index $n$ such that $R^{n}=R^{n+1}=\ldots$ and $C^{n}=C^{n+1}=\ldots$ Then $\rho^{n}\left(R^{n}\right)=R^{2 n}=R^{n}$, so $\rho^{n}$ restricted to $R^{n}$ is a bijection. Similarly, $\sigma^{n}$ restricted to $C^{n}$ is a bijection from $C^{n}$ to itself. Therefore, there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $\rho^{n k}$ acts identically on $R^{n}$, and $\sigma^{n k}$ acts identically on $C^{n}$.

We claim now that $\left(R^{n}, C^{n}\right)$ is a saddle subpair of $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$, with $\left|R^{n}\right| \leqslant\left|R^{1}\right|=\left|\rho\left(R_{1}\right)\right| \leqslant$ $\left|R_{2}\right|$, which is what we needed. To check that this is a saddle pair, take any row $r^{\prime}$; since $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$ is a saddle pair, there exists $r_{1} \in R_{1}$ such that $a\left(r_{1}, c_{1}\right) \geqslant a\left(r^{\prime}, c_{1}\right)$ for all $c_{1} \in C_{1}$. Set now $r_{*}=\rho^{n k}\left(r_{1}\right) \in R^{n}$. Then, for each $c \in C^{n}$ we have $c=\sigma^{n k}(c)$ and hence

$$
a\left(r_{*}, c\right)=a\left(\rho^{n k}\left(r_{1}\right), c\right) \geqslant a\left(r_{1}, \sigma^{n k}(c)\right)=a\left(r_{1}, c\right) \geqslant a\left(r^{\prime}, c\right)
$$

which establishes condition $(i)$. Condition (ii) is checked similarly.

Since both chains consist of finite sets, there is an index $n$ such that $R^{n}=R^{n+1}=\ldots$ and $C^{n}=C^{n+1}=\ldots$ Then $\rho^{n}\left(R^{n}\right)=R^{2 n}=R^{n}$, so $\rho^{n}$ restricted to $R^{n}$ is a bijection. Similarly, $\sigma^{n}$ restricted to $C^{n}$ is a bijection from $C^{n}$ to itself. Therefore, there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $\rho^{n k}$ acts identically on $R^{n}$, and $\sigma^{n k}$ acts identically on $C^{n}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates sophisticated fixed-point reasoning by analyzing what happens when the functions are repeatedly applied. They identify that the sequence of images must eventually stabilize due to finiteness, and then use this to find a power of the function that acts as the identity on the stabilized set. This is advanced mathematical reasoning about the eventual behavior of iterated functions.</explanation>

<text>Let $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$ and $\left(R_{2}, C_{2}\right)$ be two saddle pairs with $\left|R_{1}\right|>\left|R_{2}\right|$. We will find a saddle subpair $\left(R^{\prime}, C^{\prime}\right)$ of $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$ with $\left|R^{\prime}\right| \leqslant\left|R_{2}\right|$; clearly, this implies the desired statement.</text>
<explanation>The solver sets up a proof by contradiction by assuming there exist two saddle pairs with different numbers of rows. The goal is to show that this assumption leads to a contradiction with the definition of minimal pairs, which would prove that all minimal pairs must have the same number of rows.</explanation>

<start>2674</start>
<end>2784</end>
<text>We claim now that $\left(R^{n}, C^{n}\right)$ is a saddle subpair of $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$, with $\left|R^{n}\right| \leqslant\left|R^{1}\right|=\left|\rho\left(R_{1}\right)\right| \leqslant$ $\left|R_{2}\right|$, which is what we needed.</text>
<explanation>The solver completes the contradiction by showing that they've constructed a proper saddle subpair with fewer rows than the original pair. This contradicts the assumption that the original pair was minimal, thus completing the proof by contradiction and establishing that minimal pairs must have the same number of rows.</explanation>
