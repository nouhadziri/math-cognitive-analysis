Problem:
2 mol of $\mathrm{Hg}(g)$ is combusted in a fixed volume bomb calorimeter with excess of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at $298 \mathrm{~K}$ and 1 atm into $\mathrm{HgO}(s)$. During the reaction, temperature increases from $298.0 \mathrm{~K}$ to $312.8 \mathrm{~K}$. If heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter and enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{Hg}(g)$ are $20.00 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ and $61.32 \mathrm{~kJ}$ $\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ at $298 \mathrm{~K}$, respectively, the calculated standard molar enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{HgO}(s)$ at 298 $\mathrm{K}$ is $\mathrm{X} \mathrm{kJ} \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. What is the value of $|\mathrm{X}|$?

[Given: Gas constant $\mathrm{R}=8.3 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ ]

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let's analyze the problem.
We have the combustion of Hg(g) in a bomb calorimeter.
The reaction is: $2 \mathrm{Hg}(g) + \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HgO}(s)$
Number of moles of Hg(g) combusted = 2 mol
Initial temperature, $T_1 = 298 \mathrm{~K}$
Final temperature, $T_2 = 312.8 \mathrm{~K}$
Heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter, $C_{cal} = 20.00 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$
Enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{Hg}(g)$, $\Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{Hg}(g)) = 61.32 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ at $298 \mathrm{~K}$
We need to find the standard molar enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{HgO}(s)$ at $298 \mathrm{~K}$.

Since the reaction occurs in a bomb calorimeter, the volume is constant. Therefore, the heat released is equal to the change in internal energy, $\Delta U$.
$q_v = \Delta U = C_{cal} \Delta T$
$\Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 312.8 \mathrm{~K} - 298.0 \mathrm{~K} = 14.8 \mathrm{~K}$
$q_v = \Delta U = 20.00 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \times 14.8 \mathrm{~K} = 296 \mathrm{~kJ}$
Since the temperature increased, the reaction is exothermic, and the heat released by the system is -296 kJ. This is for the combustion of 2 moles of Hg(g).
So, $\Delta U$ for the reaction $2 \mathrm{Hg}(g) + \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HgO}(s)$ is $-296 \mathrm{~kJ}$.

We need to find the standard enthalpy change for this reaction, $\Delta H_{rxn}$.
We know the relation between $\Delta H$ and $\Delta U$:
$\Delta H = \Delta U + \Delta (PV)$
Since the volume is constant, $\Delta (PV) = \Delta (nRT) = RT \Delta n_g$, assuming ideal gas behavior.
$\Delta n_g = \text{moles of gaseous products} - \text{moles of gaseous reactants}$
In the reaction $2 \mathrm{Hg}(g) + \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HgO}(s)$, the gaseous reactants are 2 moles of Hg and 1 mole of O$_2$, and there are no gaseous products.
$\Delta n_g = 0 - (2 + 1) = -3$
$\Delta H = \Delta U + RT \Delta n_g$
$\Delta H = -296 \mathrm{~kJ} + (8.3 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}) \times 298 \mathrm{~K} \times (-3 \mathrm{~mol})$
$\Delta H = -296 \mathrm{~kJ} - 7.4178 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$\Delta H = -303.4178 \mathrm{~kJ}$
This is the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of 2 moles of Hg(g).

The standard enthalpy change of the reaction can also be calculated using the standard enthalpies of formation:
$\Delta H_{rxn}^\circ = \sum n_p \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{products}) - \sum n_r \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{reactants})$
For the reaction $2 \mathrm{Hg}(g) + \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HgO}(s)$:
$\Delta H_{rxn}^\circ = 2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}(s)) - [2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{Hg}(g)) + 1 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{O}_{2}(g))]$
We know $\Delta H_{rxn}^\circ = -303.4178 \mathrm{~kJ}$ for 2 moles of HgO.
The standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard state is 0, so $\Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{O}_{2}(g)) = 0$.
$-303.4178 \mathrm{~kJ} = 2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}(s)) - [2 \times 61.32 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} + 0]$
$-303.4178 \mathrm{~kJ} = 2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}(s)) - 122.64 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}(s)) = -303.4178 \mathrm{~kJ} + 122.64 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}(s)) = -180.7778 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$\Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}(s)) = -180.7778 \mathrm{~kJ} / 2 \mathrm{~mol}$
$\Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}(s)) = -90.3889 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$

The calculated standard molar enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{HgO}(s)$ at $298 \mathrm{~K}$ is X kJ mol$^{-1}$.
X = -90.3889
We need to find the value of $|X|$.
$|X| = |-90.3889| = 90.3889$

Let's double check the calculations.
Heat released by the reaction, $q = -C_{cal} \Delta T = -20.00 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \times (312.8 - 298.0) \mathrm{~K} = -20.00 \times 14.8 = -296 \mathrm{~kJ}$.
This is the heat released at constant volume, which is equal to $\Delta U$ for the reaction.
For the reaction of 2 moles of Hg(g): $\Delta U = -296 \mathrm{~kJ}$.
$\Delta H = \Delta U + \Delta (n_g) RT$
$\Delta n_g = n_g(\text{products}) - n_g(\text{reactants}) = 0 - (2+1) = -3$
$\Delta H = -296 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~J} + (-3) \times 8.314 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \times 298 \mathrm{~K}$
$\Delta H = -296000 \mathrm{~J} - 7432.572 \mathrm{~J}$
$\Delta H = -303432.572 \mathrm{~J} = -303.43 \mathrm{~kJ}$
This is the enthalpy change for the reaction of 2 moles of Hg(g).

The reaction is $2 \mathrm{Hg}(g) + \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HgO}(s)$.
$\Delta H_{rxn} = \sum n \Delta H_f (\text{products}) - \sum n \Delta H_f (\text{reactants})$
$-303.43 \mathrm{~kJ} = 2 \times \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) - [2 \times \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{Hg}, g) + 1 \times \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{O}_2, g)]$
$-303.43 \mathrm{~kJ} = 2 \times \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) - [2 \times 61.32 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} + 0]$
$-303.43 \mathrm{~kJ} = 2 \times \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) - 122.64 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$2 \times \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) = -303.43 \mathrm{~kJ} + 122.64 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$2 \times \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) = -180.79 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$\Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) = -180.79 / 2 = -90.395 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$
X = -90.395
$|X| = |-90.395| = 90.395$

The gas constant is given as $R = 8.3 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. Let's recalculate with this value.
$\Delta H = -296 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~J} + (-3) \times 8.3 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \times 298 \mathrm{~K}$
$\Delta H = -296000 \mathrm{~J} - 7417.8 \mathrm{~J}$
$\Delta H = -303417.8 \mathrm{~J} = -303.4178 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$-303.4178 \mathrm{~kJ} = 2 \times \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) - 122.64 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$2 \times \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) = -303.4178 \mathrm{~kJ} + 122.64 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$2 \times \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) = -180.7778 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$\Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) = -180.7778 / 2 = -90.3889 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$
X = -90.3889
$|X| = 90.3889$
Round to appropriate significant figures. The heat capacity is given to 4 significant figures, and the temperature difference has 3 significant figures. The enthalpy of formation of Hg(g) has 4 significant figures.
Let's keep more digits during the calculation and round at the end.

The heat released by the reaction is $q = -C_{cal} \Delta T = -20.00 \times (312.8 - 298.0) = -20.00 \times 14.8 = -296.0 \mathrm{~kJ}$.
This is $\Delta U$ for the reaction of 2 moles of Hg(g).
$\Delta H = \Delta U + \Delta n_g RT$
$\Delta H = -296.0 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~J} + (-3) \times 8.3 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \times 298 \mathrm{~K}$
$\Delta H = -296000 \mathrm{~J} - 7417.8 \mathrm{~J} = -303417.8 \mathrm{~J} = -303.4178 \mathrm{~kJ}$
This is the enthalpy change for the combustion of 2 moles of Hg(g).

$2 \mathrm{Hg}(g) + \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HgO}(s)$
$\Delta H_{rxn} = 2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) - [2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{Hg}, g) + \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{O}_2, g)]$
$-303.4178 \mathrm{~kJ} = 2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) - [2 \times 61.32 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} + 0]$
$-303.4178 \mathrm{~kJ} = 2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) - 122.64 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) = -303.4178 + 122.64 = -180.7778 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$\Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) = -180.7778 / 2 = -90.3889 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$
X = -90.3889
$|X| = 90.3889$

Round to one decimal place as in the options, but the question asks for the exact value.
Let's assume we need to round to a reasonable number of significant figures. The least number of decimal places in the given data involving subtraction is one (in temperatures). However, the heat capacity has 4 significant figures, and $\Delta T$ has 3 significant figures, so the heat released should have 3 significant figures based on $\Delta T$, or 4 based on $C_{cal}$. Let's use more precision.

The question asks for the value of $|X|$.
$X = -90.3889$
$|X| = 90.3889$

Consider potential pitfalls:
- Sign of heat released.
- Calculation of $\Delta n_g$.
- Units consistency.
- Using the correct number of moles for $\Delta H_{rxn}$.

Double check the definition of standard molar enthalpy of formation. It is the enthalpy change when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

The calculated $\Delta H_{rxn}$ is for the formation of 2 moles of HgO(s).

The standard molar enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{HgO}(s)$ is what we calculated as $\Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s)$.

Final check of the numerical calculations:
$\Delta T = 312.8 - 298.0 = 14.8 \mathrm{~K}$
$q = -20.00 \times 14.8 = -296.0 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$\Delta U = -296.0 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$\Delta n_g = 0 - 3 = -3$
$RT \Delta n_g = 8.3 \times 298 \times (-3) = -7417.8 \mathrm{~J} = -7.4178 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$\Delta H = -296.0 - 7.4178 = -303.4178 \mathrm{~kJ}$ (for 2 moles of HgO)

$2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) = \Delta H_{rxn} + 2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{Hg}, g)$
$2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) = -303.4178 + 2 \times 61.32 = -303.4178 + 122.64 = -180.7778 \mathrm{~kJ}$
$\Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{HgO}, s) = -180.7778 / 2 = -90.3889 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$
X = -90.3889
$|X| = 90.3889$
