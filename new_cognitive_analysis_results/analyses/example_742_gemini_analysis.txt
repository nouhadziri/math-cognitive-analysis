Problem:
Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the set of ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ of nonnegative real numbers that lie in the plane $x+y+z=1.$ Let us say that $(x,y,z)$ supports $(a,b,c)$ when exactly two of the following are true: $x\ge a, y\ge b, z\ge c.$ Let $\mathcal{S}$ consist of those triples in $\mathcal{T}$ that support $\left(\frac 12,\frac 13,\frac 16\right).$ The area of $\mathcal{S}$ divided by the area of $\mathcal{T}$ is $m/n,$ where $m_{}$ and $n_{}$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n.$

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the ratio of the area of a subset $\mathcal{S}$ of a triangular region $\mathcal{T}$ to the area of $\mathcal{T}$. The region $\mathcal{T}$ is the part of the plane $x+y+z=1$ in the first octant, where $x, y, z \ge 0$. This forms an equilateral triangle in 3D space with vertices $(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)$.

The area of $\mathcal{T}$ can be found. Consider the projection of $\mathcal{T}$ onto one of the coordinate planes, e.g., the $xy$-plane. The projection is the triangle with vertices $(1,0), (0,1), (0,0)$, which has area $\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 = \frac{1}{2}$. The normal vector to the plane $x+y+z=1$ is $\mathbf{n} = (1,1,1)$. The unit normal vector is $\hat{\mathbf{n}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(1,1,1)$. The cosine of the angle between the normal vector and the $z$-axis (normal to the $xy$-plane) is $\hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot (0,0,1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.

Let $A(\mathcal{T})$ be the area of $\mathcal{T}$, and $A_{xy}$ be the area of the projection onto the $xy$-plane. Then $A_{xy} = A(\mathcal{T}) |\cos \gamma|$, where $\gamma$ is the angle between the normal vector and the $z$-axis. So, $\frac{1}{2} = A(\mathcal{T}) \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, which gives $A(\mathcal{T}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Now, let's consider the condition for a triple $(x,y,z) \in \mathcal{T}$ to support $(a,b,c) = \left(\frac 12,\frac 13,\frac 16\right)$. The conditions are $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y \ge \frac{1}{3}, z \ge \frac{1}{6}$. Exactly two of these inequalities must be true.

Case 1: $x \ge \frac{1}{2}$ and $y \ge \frac{1}{3}$, but $z < \frac{1}{6}$.
Since $(x,y,z) \in \mathcal{T}$, we have $x+y+z=1$. The region is defined by:
$x \ge \frac{1}{2}$
$y \ge \frac{1}{3}$
$z < \frac{1}{6} \implies 1 - x - y < \frac{1}{6} \implies x + y > 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$

Consider the coordinates in the plane $x+y+z=1$. We can parameterize the triangle. Let's use barycentric coordinates. The vertices are $P_1=(1,0,0), P_2=(0,1,0), P_3=(0,0,1)$. Any point in the triangle can be written as $\alpha P_1 + \beta P_2 + \gamma P_3$, where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \ge 0$ and $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=1$. Here, $(x,y,z) = (\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$.

The conditions in terms of $x,y$:
$x \ge \frac{1}{2}$
$y \ge \frac{1}{3}$
$x+y > \frac{5}{6}$

The region in the $xy$-plane projection is where $x \ge 0, y \ge 0, x+y \le 1$.
The inequalities define a subregion of this triangle.

Consider the lines $x = \frac{1}{2}, y = \frac{1}{3}, x+y = \frac{5}{6}$.
Intersection of $x=\frac{1}{2}$ and $y=\frac{1}{3}$: $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3})$. Here, $x+y = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6}$.
The point $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3})$ lies on the line $x+y = \frac{5}{6}$.

The region defined by $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y \ge \frac{1}{3}, x+y > \frac{5}{6}$ is empty, since if $x \ge \frac{1}{2}$ and $y \ge \frac{1}{3}$, then $x+y \ge \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6}$. The inequality is strict, so the region is the single point $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3})$. However, this point corresponds to $z = 1 - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6}$, so $z = \frac{1}{6}$, which contradicts $z < \frac{1}{6}$. Thus, this case contributes no area.

Let's re-evaluate the conditions more carefully.
The set $\mathcal{T}$ is an equilateral triangle. We can work directly in the plane $x+y+z=1$.

Case 1: $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y \ge \frac{1}{3}, z < \frac{1}{6}$.
The inequalities define a region within the triangle $\mathcal{T}$.
The line $x = \frac{1}{2}$ intersects the edges of $\mathcal{T}$. When $y=0, z = 1-x = \frac{1}{2}$. Point $(\frac{1}{2}, 0, \frac{1}{2})$. When $z=0, y = 1-x = \frac{1}{2}$. Point $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$.
The line $y = \frac{1}{3}$ intersects the edges at $(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0)$ and $(0, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3})$.
The plane $z = \frac{1}{6}$ intersects $\mathcal{T}$ forming a line segment.

Consider the vertices of $\mathcal{T}$: $A=(1,0,0), B=(0,1,0), C=(0,0,1)$.

The conditions are:
1. $x \ge \frac{1}{2}$
2. $y \ge \frac{1}{3}$
3. $z < \frac{1}{6}$

Consider the lines on the triangle: $x=\frac{1}{2}, y=\frac{1}{3}, z=\frac{1}{6}$. These divide the triangle into smaller regions.

Let's use a change of variables to work in 2D. Project onto the $xy$-plane. The region is $x \ge 0, y \ge 0, x+y \le 1$.
The supporting conditions become:
1. $x \ge \frac{1}{2}$
2. $y \ge \frac{1}{3}$
3. $1 - x - y < \frac{1}{6} \implies x+y > \frac{5}{6}$

The region defined by $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y \ge \frac{1}{3}$ is the corner near $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$.
The line $x=\frac{1}{2}$ intersects the boundary at $(\frac{1}{2}, 0)$ and $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$.
The line $y=\frac{1}{3}$ intersects the boundary at $(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{3})$ and $(0, \frac{1}{3})$.
The line $x+y = \frac{5}{6}$ passes through $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3})$.

The region $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y \ge \frac{1}{3}$ in the projected triangle is the point $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3})$.
The condition $x+y > \frac{5}{6}$ means we are outside or on the line $x+y = \frac{5}{6}$.

For Case 1, we need $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y \ge \frac{1}{3}, x+y > \frac{5}{6}$. This region is empty.

Case 2: $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y < \frac{1}{3}, z \ge \frac{1}{6}$.
$x \ge \frac{1}{2}$
$y < \frac{1}{3}$
$1 - x - y \ge \frac{1}{6} \implies x+y \le \frac{5}{6}$

Region in the $xy$-plane: $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y < \frac{1}{3}, x+y \le \frac{5}{6}$.
Consider the vertices of this region:
Intersection of $x=\frac{1}{2}$ and $y=0$: $(\frac{1}{2}, 0)$.
Intersection of $x=\frac{1}{2}$ and $x+y=\frac{5}{6}$: $\frac{1}{2} + y = \frac{5}{6} \implies y = \frac{5}{6} - \frac{3}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$. Point $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3})$.
Intersection of $y=0$ and $x+y=\frac{5}{6}$: $(\frac{5}{6}, 0)$.

The region is a triangle with vertices $(\frac{1}{2}, 0), (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}), (\frac{5}{6}, 0)$.
The boundaries are $x=\frac{1}{2}, y=0, x+y=\frac{5}{6}$.

Area of this triangle: Base along the $x$-axis from $\frac{1}{2}$ to $\frac{5}{6}$, length $\frac{5}{6} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5-3}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$.
Height at $x=\frac{1}{2}$ is $y=\frac{1}{3}$.
Area = $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{18}$.

Case 3: $x < \frac{1}{2}, y \ge \frac{1}{3}, z \ge \frac{1}{6}$.
$x < \frac{1}{2}$
$y \ge \frac{1}{3}$
$1 - x - y \ge \frac{1}{6} \implies x+y \le \frac{5}{6}$

Region in the $xy$-plane: $x < \frac{1}{2}, y \ge \frac{1}{3}, x+y \le \frac{5}{6}$.
Consider the vertices:
Intersection of $y=\frac{1}{3}$ and $x=0$: $(0, \frac{1}{3})$.
Intersection of $y=\frac{1}{3}$ and $x+y=\frac{5}{6}$: $x + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6} \implies x = \frac{5}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$. Point $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3})$.
Intersection of $x=0$ and $x+y=\frac{5}{6}$: $(0, \frac{5}{6})$.

The region is a triangle with vertices $(0, \frac{1}{3}), (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}), (0, \frac{5}{6})$.
Base along the $y$-axis from $\frac{1}{3}$ to $\frac{5}{6}$, length $\frac{5}{6} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5-2}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$.
Height at $y=\frac{1}{3}$ is $x=\frac{1}{2}$.
Area = $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}$.

Case 4: $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y < \frac{1}{3}, z < \frac{1}{6}$.
Only one inequality is true, not exactly two.

Case 5: $x < \frac{1}{2}, y \ge \frac{1}{3}, z < \frac{1}{6}$.
Only one inequality is true.

Case 6: $x < \frac{1}{2}, y < \frac{1}{3}, z \ge \frac{1}{6}$.
$x < \frac{1}{2}$
$y < \frac{1}{3}$
$1 - x - y \ge \frac{1}{6} \implies x+y \le \frac{5}{6}$

Region in the $xy$-plane: $x < \frac{1}{2}, y < \frac{1}{3}, x+y \le \frac{5}{6}$.
Consider the vertices: $(0,0), (\frac{1}{2}, 0), (0, \frac{1}{3})$.
The region is a triangle with vertices $(0,0), (\frac{1}{2}, 0), (0, \frac{1}{3})$. Area $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{12}$.

We need to consider the areas in the plane $x+y+z=1$.
The ratio of areas is the same as the ratio of the areas of the projections onto the $xy$-plane.
Area of $\mathcal{T}$ projection is $\frac{1}{2}$.

The subset $\mathcal{S}$ corresponds to the union of the regions from Case 2, Case 3, and Case 6.
These regions are disjoint.

Area of projection of $\mathcal{S}$ = Area(Case 2) + Area(Case 3) + Area(Case 6)
Area = $\frac{1}{18} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{12}$
Find a common denominator: 72.
$\frac{4}{72} + \frac{9}{72} + \frac{6}{72} = \frac{4+9+6}{72} = \frac{19}{72}$.

Ratio of areas = $\frac{\text{Area}(\mathcal{S})}{\text{Area}(\mathcal{T})} = \frac{\text{Area projection}(\mathcal{S})}{\text{Area projection}(\mathcal{T})} = \frac{19/72}{1/2} = \frac{19}{72} \times 2 = \frac{19}{36}$.

So, $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{19}{36}$.
$m = 19, n = 36$.
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
$m+n = 19 + 36 = 55$.

Let's double-check the calculations.

The area of $\mathcal{T}$ is the area of an equilateral triangle with side length $\sqrt{2}$.
The distance between $(1,0,0)$ and $(0,1,0)$ is $\sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \sqrt{1+1} = \sqrt{2}$.
Area of equilateral triangle with side $s$ is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2$.
Area of $\mathcal{T} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (\sqrt{2})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. This matches our earlier calculation.

Consider the supporting conditions again: exactly two of $x \ge a, y \ge b, z \ge c$.
Let $P: x \ge a, Q: y \ge b, R: z \ge c$.
We need $(P \land Q \land \neg R) \lor (P \land \neg Q \land R) \lor (\neg P \land Q \land R)$.

Case 1: $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y \ge \frac{1}{3}, z < \frac{1}{6}$. (PQ not R)
Case 2: $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y < \frac{1}{3}, z \ge \frac{1}{6}$. (P not Q R)
Case 3: $x < \frac{1}{2}, y \ge \frac{1}{3}, z \ge \frac{1}{6}$. (not P Q R)

Consider the geometry in the plane $x+y+z=1$.
The lines $x=\frac{1}{2}, y=\frac{1}{3}, z=\frac{1}{6}$ divide the triangle.
The intersections of these lines with the edges of the triangle can be found.

Consider the barycentric coordinate system on the triangle with vertices $(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)$.
The lines $x=a, y=b, z=c$ correspond to lines parallel to the sides of the triangle.

The coordinates of the vertices of the subregions need to be carefully determined.

Case 2: $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y < \frac{1}{3}, z \ge \frac{1}{6}$.
Vertices of the region in the plane $x+y+z=1$.
Intersection of $x=\frac{1}{2}$ and $z=\frac{1}{6}$: $(\frac{1}{2}, 1 - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{6}) = (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{6})$.
Intersection of $x=\frac{1}{2}$ and $y=\frac{1}{3}$: $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{6})$.
Intersection of $y=\frac{1}{3}$ and $z=\frac{1}{6}$: $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{6})$.

The lines intersect at a single point $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{6})$.

Consider the vertices of $\mathcal{T}$ and the lines dividing it.
The line $x=\frac{1}{2}$ connects $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$ and $(\frac{1}{2}, 0, \frac{1}{2})$.
The line $y=\frac{1}{3}$ connects $(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0)$ and $(0, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3})$.
The line $z=\frac{1}{6}$ connects $(\frac{5}{6}, 0, \frac{1}{6})$ and $(0, \frac{5}{6}, \frac{1}{6})$.

The point $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{6})$ is where all three planes intersect within the triangle.

The regions in the plane are triangles. Their areas can be calculated.

Ratio of areas is indeed the ratio of the areas of the projections.

Final check of the area calculations for the projections:

Case 2: Vertices $(\frac{1}{2}, 0), (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}), (\frac{5}{6}, 0)$. Triangle. Area $\frac{1}{18}$. Correct.
Case 3: Vertices $(0, \frac{1}{3}), (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}), (0, \frac{5}{6})$. Triangle. Area $\frac{1}{8}$. Correct.
Case 6: Need to be careful with the inequalities being strict.
Region $x < \frac{1}{2}, y < \frac{1}{3}, x+y \le \frac{5}{6}$.
The vertices are $(0,0), (\frac{1}{2}, 0), (0, \frac{1}{3})$.
The boundary lines are $x=\frac{1}{2}, y=\frac{1}{3}, x+y=\frac{5}{6}$.

Consider the triangle with vertices $(0,0), (\frac{1}{2}, 0), (0, \frac{1}{3})$. Area $\frac{1}{12}$.

The regions corresponding to the three cases are disjoint in the projection.

The area of the projection of $\mathcal{S}$ is the sum of the areas of the three triangles: $\frac{1}{18} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{4+9+6}{72} = \frac{19}{72}$.
The area of the projection of $\mathcal{T}$ is $\frac{1}{2}$.
The ratio is $\frac{19/72}{1/2} = \frac{19}{36}$.

$m = 19, n = 36$. Relatively prime: gcd(19, 36) = gcd(19, 36 mod 19) = gcd(19, 17) = gcd(17, 2) = gcd(2, 1) = 1.
$m+n = 19 + 36 = 55$.

<text>Consider the supporting conditions again: exactly two of $x \ge a, y \ge b, z \ge c$.
Let $P: x \ge a, Q: y \ge b, R: z \ge c$.
We need $(P \land Q \land \neg R) \lor (P \land \neg Q \land R) \lor (\neg P \land Q \land R)$.

Case 1: $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y \ge \frac{1}{3}, z < \frac{1}{6}$. (PQ not R)
Case 2: $x \ge \frac{1}{2}, y < \frac{1}{3}, z \ge \frac{1}{6}$. (P not Q R)

<text>The area of $\mathcal{T}$ is the area of an equilateral triangle with side length $\sqrt{2}$.
The distance between $(1,0,0)$ and $(0,1,0)$ is $\sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \sqrt{1+1} = \sqrt{2}$.
Area of equilateral triangle with side $s$ is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2$.
Area of $\mathcal{T} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (\sqrt{2})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. This matches our earlier calculation.</text>
