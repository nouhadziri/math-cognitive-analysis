Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let the four-momentum of the proton be $P_p$, the four-momentum of the photon be $P_\gamma$, the four-momentum of the neutron be $P_n$, and the four-momentum of the pion be $P_\pi$.
The reaction is $p + \gamma \rightarrow n + \pi^+$.
The conservation of four-momentum implies $P_p + P_\gamma = P_n + P_\pi$.
The square of the invariant mass of the initial state is $(P_p + P_\gamma)^2$.
The square of the invariant mass of the final state is $(P_n + P_\pi)^2$.
Since the four-momentum is conserved, the square of the invariant mass is the same in both frames.
$(P_p + P_\gamma)^2 = (P_n + P_\pi)^2$
$P_p^2 + P_\gamma^2 + 2 P_p \cdot P_\gamma = P_n^2 + P_\pi^2 + 2 P_n \cdot P_\pi$
We know that $P^2 = E^2 - c^2 p^2 = m^2 c^4$. Let's use units where c=1 for simplicity, so $P^2 = E^2 - p^2 = m^2$.
$m_p^2 + m_\gamma^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma) = m_n^2 + m_\pi^2 + 2 (E_n E_\pi - \mathbf{p}_n \cdot \mathbf{p}_\pi)$
The mass of the photon is 0, so $m_\gamma = 0$.
$m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma) = m_n^2 + m_\pi^2 + 2 (E_n E_\pi - \mathbf{p}_n \cdot \mathbf{p}_\pi)$

At the threshold for production, the neutron and the pion are produced at rest.
So, $\mathbf{p}_n = 0$ and $\mathbf{p}_\pi = 0$. This implies $E_n = m_n$ and $E_\pi = m_\pi$.
The equation becomes:
$m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma) = m_n^2 + m_\pi^2 + 2 (m_n m_\pi - 0)$
$m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma) = m_n^2 + m_\pi^2 + 2 m_n m_\pi$
The term on the right hand side can be written as $(m_n + m_\pi)^2$.
$m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma) = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$

The proton is ultra-relativistic, so its energy is much greater than its mass, $E_p >> m_p$.
In this case, the magnitude of the three-momentum of the proton is approximately equal to its energy, $|\mathbf{p}_p| \approx E_p$.
The collision is head-on, so the momentum of the photon is in the opposite direction to the momentum of the proton. Let the direction of the proton's momentum be the positive x-axis. Then $\mathbf{p}_p = E_p \hat{i}$. The photon's momentum will be $\mathbf{p}_\gamma = -E_\gamma \hat{i}$.
So, $\mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma = (E_p) (-E_\gamma) = -E_p E_\gamma$.
Substitute this back into the equation:
$m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - (-E_p E_\gamma)) = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$
$m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma + E_p E_\gamma) = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$
$m_p^2 + 4 E_p E_\gamma = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$
We need to find the energy threshold of the photon. To find the minimum energy of the photon, we need to consider the minimum energy of the proton for this reaction to occur. However, the question is asking for the threshold of the photon for a given ultra high energy proton. Let's reconsider the problem from the center of momentum frame.

In the center of momentum frame, at the threshold, the produced particles are at rest. The total energy in the CM frame is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the produced particles.
Let the four-momenta in the lab frame be $P_p = (E_p, \mathbf{p}_p)$ and $P_\gamma = (E_\gamma, \mathbf{p}_\gamma)$.
The square of the center-of-mass energy is $s = (P_p + P_\gamma)^2 = m_p^2 + m_\gamma^2 + 2 P_p \cdot P_\gamma = m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma)$.
At the threshold, $\sqrt{s} = m_n + m_\pi$.
So, $s = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$.
$m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma) = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$.
Using the fact that the collision is head-on and the proton is ultra-relativistic ($|\mathbf{p}_p| \approx E_p$), and the photon moves in the opposite direction, $\mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma = - |\mathbf{p}_p| |\mathbf{p}_\gamma| \approx - E_p E_\gamma$.
$m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - (-E_p E_\gamma)) = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$
$m_p^2 + 4 E_p E_\gamma = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$

This equation relates the proton energy and the photon energy. The problem asks for the energy threshold of the photon. Let's use the center of momentum frame approach more carefully.

In the lab frame, the threshold condition means that the total energy is just enough to create the rest masses of the neutron and pion.
Let's consider the invariant mass squared of the system:
$s = (P_p + P_\gamma)^2 = P_p^2 + P_\gamma^2 + 2 P_p \cdot P_\gamma = m_p^2 + 0 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma)$
In the center of mass frame, at threshold, the total energy is $E_{CM} = m_n + m_\pi$, and the total momentum is zero.
So, $s = E_{CM}^2 = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$.
Equating the two expressions for s:
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 = m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma)$

Now let's consider the frame where the proton is initially at rest. In this frame, the photon needs to have enough energy to create the neutron and pion, giving them some momentum such that the total momentum is zero in the CM frame. This doesn't seem like the right approach given the ultra-relativistic proton.

Let's go back to the lab frame.
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 = m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma)$
Using the head-on collision and ultra-relativistic proton approximation:
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 = m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - (-E_p E_\gamma))$
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 = m_p^2 + 4 E_p E_\gamma$

We need to find the energy threshold of the photon. This means the minimum photon energy required for the reaction to occur.
Consider the situation in the center of momentum frame. At the threshold, the neutron and pion are produced at rest in this frame. The total energy in the CM frame is $m_n c^2 + m_\pi c^2$.

Let's use the invariant mass approach again.
$s = (P_p + P_\gamma)^2 = (P_n + P_\pi)^2$
In the lab frame: $m_p^2 + 2 P_p \cdot P_\gamma = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$  (at threshold in CM frame, $P_n + P_\pi = (m_n+m_\pi, \mathbf{0})$)
$m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma) = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$
Using the head-on collision: $\mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma = - |\mathbf{p}_p| |\mathbf{p}_\gamma|$.
For the photon, $E_\gamma = |\mathbf{p}_\gamma|$. For the ultra-relativistic proton, $E_p \approx |\mathbf{p}_p|$.
$m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - (-E_p E_\gamma)) = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$
$m_p^2 + 4 E_p E_\gamma = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$

This equation still contains $E_p$. The question asks for the threshold energy of the photon. This threshold is independent of the proton's energy, as long as it's sufficient for the reaction. The threshold is a property of the interaction.

Let's consider the process in the center-of-momentum frame at the threshold. In this frame, the incoming proton and photon collide to produce a neutron and pion at rest.
The total energy in the CM frame is $E_{CM} = m_n + m_\pi$.
The invariant mass squared is $s = E_{CM}^2 = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$.

Now relate this to the lab frame quantities.
$s = (P_p + P_\gamma)^2 = m_p^2 + m_\gamma^2 + 2 P_p \cdot P_\gamma = m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma)$
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 = m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma)$

Let's use the hint that at the threshold, the neutron and pion are produced at rest in their center of mass frame, which is the same as the center of momentum frame of the initial proton and photon.

The temperature of the background radiation is $T = 1$ K.
The average energy of a photon in blackbody radiation is approximately $3 k_B T$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.
$k_B = 8.617 \times 10^{-5}$ eV/K.
Average photon energy $\approx 3 \times 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \times 1 = 2.5851 \times 10^{-4}$ eV.
This is the typical energy of the photons, but we are looking for the threshold energy required for this specific reaction.

Consider the reaction in the frame where the proton is initially at rest. The photon comes in with energy $E_\gamma$ and momentum $\mathbf{p}_\gamma$. The proton has energy $m_p$ and momentum 0.
The total four-momentum is $(E_\gamma + m_p, \mathbf{p}_\gamma)$.
The square of the invariant mass is $(E_\gamma + m_p)^2 - |\mathbf{p}_\gamma|^2 = E_\gamma^2 + m_p^2 + 2 E_\gamma m_p - E_\gamma^2 = m_p^2 + 2 E_\gamma m_p$.
At the threshold, this should be equal to $(m_n + m_\pi)^2$.
$m_p^2 + 2 E_\gamma m_p = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$
$2 E_\gamma m_p = (m_n + m_\pi)^2 - m_p^2$
$2 E_\gamma m_p = (m_n^2 + m_\pi^2 + 2 m_n m_\pi) - m_p^2$
$E_\gamma = \frac{(m_n + m_\pi)^2 - m_p^2}{2 m_p}$

Let's plug in the values:
$m_n = 939.6$ MeV
$m_\pi = 139.6$ MeV
$m_p = 938.3$ MeV
$m_n + m_\pi = 939.6 + 139.6 = 1079.2$ MeV
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 = (1079.2)^2 = 1164672.64$ MeV$^2$
$m_p^2 = (938.3)^2 = 879906.89$ MeV$^2$
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 - m_p^2 = 1164672.64 - 879906.89 = 284765.75$ MeV$^2$
$2 m_p = 2 \times 938.3 = 1876.6$ MeV
$E_\gamma = \frac{284765.75}{1876.6} = 151.74$ MeV

This is the threshold energy of the photon in the rest frame of the proton.
However, the proton is ultra high energy. The CMB photons have low energy.

Consider the collision in the lab frame where the proton has very high energy.
The threshold condition is determined by the minimum invariant mass of the final state.
$(P_p + P_\gamma)^2 = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$
$m_p^2 + 2 P_p \cdot P_\gamma = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$
$m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma) = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$

Let the energy of the photon be $\epsilon$.
The energy of the proton is $E$.
Since the proton is ultra-relativistic, $E \approx |\mathbf{p}_p|$.
The photon's energy is equal to the magnitude of its momentum.
The collision is head-on. Let the proton move along the positive x-axis, and the photon along the negative x-axis.
$\mathbf{p}_p = (E, 0, 0)$
$\mathbf{p}_\gamma = (0, 0, -\epsilon)$  -- Mistake here, momentum is a vector.
If proton moves along +x, $\mathbf{p}_p = (E, 0, 0)$.
Photon moves along -x, $\mathbf{p}_\gamma = (-\epsilon, 0, 0)$.

$P_p = (E, E, 0, 0)$ (approximating $m_p=0$ for ultra-relativistic)
$P_\gamma = (\epsilon, -\epsilon, 0, 0)$
$P_p \cdot P_\gamma = E \epsilon - E (-\epsilon) = 2 E \epsilon$

Using the exact form:
$P_p = (E_p, p_p, 0, 0)$
$P_\gamma = (E_\gamma, -E_\gamma, 0, 0)$
$P_p \cdot P_\gamma = E_p E_\gamma - p_p (-E_\gamma) = E_p E_\gamma + p_p E_\gamma = E_\gamma (E_p + p_p)$
This is wrong.

Let the four-momenta be:
$P_p = (E_p, \mathbf{p}_p)$
$P_\gamma = (E_\gamma, \mathbf{p}_\gamma)$
$P_p \cdot P_\gamma = E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma$
Head-on collision: $\mathbf{p}_p$ and $\mathbf{p}_\gamma$ are anti-parallel.
Let $\mathbf{p}_p = p_p \hat{n}$, $\mathbf{p}_\gamma = p_\gamma (-\hat{n})$.
$\mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma = p_p p_\gamma (\hat{n} \cdot (-\hat{n})) = - p_p p_\gamma$.
$P_p \cdot P_\gamma = E_p E_\gamma - (-p_p p_\gamma) = E_p E_\gamma + p_p p_\gamma$.
For photon, $p_\gamma = E_\gamma$.
For ultra-relativistic proton, $p_p \approx E_p$.
$P_p \cdot P_\gamma = E_p E_\gamma + E_p E_\gamma = 2 E_p E_\gamma$.

Equation from invariant mass:
$m_p^2 + 2 P_p \cdot P_\gamma = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$
$m_p^2 + 4 E_p E_\gamma = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$

This equation still involves $E_p$. The threshold energy of the photon should be independent of the proton's energy.

Let's use the center of momentum frame.
In the CM frame, at threshold, the total energy is $m_n + m_\pi$.
The invariant mass squared is $s = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$.
In the lab frame, $s = (P_p + P_\gamma)^2 = m_p^2 + 2 P_p \cdot P_\gamma$.
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 = m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma)$.

Consider the frame where the center of mass is at rest. In this frame, the energies of the proton and photon are $E'_p$ and $E'_\gamma$, and their momenta are equal and opposite: $|\mathbf{p}'_p| = |\mathbf{p}'_\gamma| = p'$.
$s = (E'_p + E'_\gamma)^2 - (\mathbf{p}'_p + \mathbf{p}'_\gamma)^2 = (E'_p + E'_\gamma)^2$.
Also, $s = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$.

Let's go back to the lab frame and the threshold condition in that frame.
At the threshold, the produced neutron and pion are at rest in the center of momentum frame.

The minimum energy for the reaction occurs when the outgoing particles are produced with zero relative momentum, i.e., they move together with the same velocity (the velocity of the center of mass).

Consider the invariant mass squared:
$s = (P_p + P_\gamma)^2 = m_p^2 + 2 m_p E_{\gamma, rest frame}$ (if proton is at rest)

The threshold condition is $(P_p + P_\gamma)^2 = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$.
$m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma) = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$.
Using head-on collision and ultra-relativistic proton:
$m_p^2 + 4 E_p E_\gamma = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$.
We need to find the threshold energy of the photon.

The temperature of the background radiation is relevant for the energy of the photon. The typical energy of a CMB photon is $\approx 2.7 k_B T$.
For $T=1$ K, $E_\gamma \approx 2.7 \times 8.617 \times 10^{-5}$ eV $= 2.326 \times 10^{-4}$ eV.

Let's re-read Hint 1: At the threshold for production of the pion and neutron, they are both produced at rest in the center of momentum frame.

Consider the invariant mass squared of the initial state.
$s = (P_p + P_\gamma)^2 = m_p^2 + m_\gamma^2 + 2 P_p \cdot P_\gamma = m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma)$.
At threshold, this must equal the invariant mass squared of the final state when the neutron and pion are at rest in the CM frame.
The total energy in the CM frame is $m_n + m_\pi$, and the momentum is zero.
So, $s = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$.
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 = m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma)$.
For head-on collision, $\mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma = - |\mathbf{p}_p| |\mathbf{p}_\gamma| = - p_p E_\gamma$.
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 = m_p^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma + p_p E_\gamma) = m_p^2 + 2 E_\gamma (E_p + p_p)$.
For ultra-relativistic proton, $p_p \approx E_p$.
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 = m_p^2 + 2 E_\gamma (E_p + E_p) = m_p^2 + 4 E_p E_\gamma$.

This approach seems to lead to the same equation. Let's think about the meaning of threshold energy.

The threshold energy of the photon is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. This should be derived from the kinematics of the reaction.

Consider the center of momentum frame. The total four-momentum is conserved.
$P_p^* + P_\gamma^* = P_n^* + P_\pi^*$.
At threshold, $\mathbf{p}_n^* = 0$, $\mathbf{p}_\pi^* = 0$.
$E_n^* = m_n$, $E_\pi^* = m_\pi$.
$E_{CM} = E_n^* + E_\pi^* = m_n + m_\pi$.
$\sqrt{s} = m_n + m_\pi$.

We have $s = m_p^2 + 2 E_\gamma (E_p + p_p)$.
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 - m_p^2 = 2 E_\gamma (E_p + p_p)$.
$E_\gamma = \frac{(m_n + m_\pi)^2 - m_p^2}{2 (E_p + p_p)}$.

This still depends on the proton's energy.

Consider the reaction in the lab frame. The minimum photon energy will correspond to the situation where the produced particles have minimum kinetic energy, which is zero in the CM frame.

Let the threshold photon energy be $E_{th}$.
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 = m_p^2 + 4 E_p E_{th}$.
$E_{th} = \frac{(m_n + m_\pi)^2 - m_p^2}{4 E_p}$.

The energy of the proton is ultra high. The problem seems ill-posed if the threshold depends on the proton energy.

Let's use the formula for the threshold energy of a particle $b$ in a collision $a+b \rightarrow c+d$:
$E_{b,th} = \frac{(m_c + m_d)^2 - m_a^2 - m_b^2}{2 m_a}$ (when particle $a$ is the target at rest).

In our case, the target is the photon. Let's consider the proton as the target and find the threshold energy of the photon in the proton's rest frame.
$E_{\gamma,th} = \frac{(m_n + m_\pi)^2 - m_p^2 - m_\gamma^2}{2 m_p} = \frac{(m_n + m_\pi)^2 - m_p^2}{2 m_p}$.
This matches our previous calculation in the proton rest frame.

Now, transform this energy to the lab frame where the proton is ultra-relativistic.
The energy of the photon in the lab frame is related to its energy in the proton's rest frame by the Lorentz transformation.
Let the proton be moving along the z-axis. The photon's momentum is along the -z axis.
$E_{\gamma, lab} = \gamma (E_{\gamma, rest} + \beta p_{\gamma, rest, z})$.
In the rest frame of the proton, the collision is head-on.
$p_{\gamma, rest} = E_{\gamma, rest}$.
$E_{\gamma, lab} = \gamma (E_{\gamma, rest} - \beta E_{\gamma, rest}) = \gamma E_{\gamma, rest} (1 - \beta)$.
Since $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$, and for ultra-relativistic proton $\beta \approx 1$.
$1 - \beta^2 = (1-\beta)(1+\beta) \approx 2 (1-\beta)$.
$1-\beta \approx 1/(2 \gamma^2)$.
$E_{\gamma, lab} = \gamma E_{\gamma, rest} \frac{1}{2 \gamma^2} = \frac{E_{\gamma, rest}}{2 \gamma}$.

This doesn't seem right.

Let's use the invariant $s$.
$s = m_p^2 + 2 E_p E_\gamma (1 + \cos \theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the momenta. For head-on, $\theta = \pi$, $\cos \theta = -1$.
$s = m_p^2$. Mistake in formula.

$s = m_p^2 + 2 E_p E_\gamma (1 - \cos \theta)$. Where $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{p}_p$ and $-\mathbf{p}_\gamma$. So $\theta = 0$.
$s = m_p^2 + 4 E_p E_\gamma$.

The threshold energy of the photon depends on the frame of reference. The question implies the lab frame where the CMB photon exists.

$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 = m_p^2 + 4 E_p E_{\gamma, th}$.
$E_{\gamma, th} = \frac{(m_n + m_\pi)^2 - m_p^2}{4 E_p}$.

The temperature of the background radiation suggests we should consider the typical energy of the CMB photons.

Let's use the result from the proton rest frame and transform it.
$E_{\gamma, rest} = 151.74$ MeV.
The energy of the ultra high energy proton is very large.

Consider the reaction in the CM frame at threshold.
Total energy = $m_n + m_\pi$.

Let's reconsider the invariant mass approach carefully.
$(P_p + P_\gamma)^2 = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$
$m_p^2 + 2 E_p E_\gamma (1 - \mathbf{\beta}_p \cdot \mathbf{\beta}_\gamma) = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$.
Head-on, $\mathbf{\beta}_p \cdot \mathbf{\beta}_\gamma = - |\mathbf{\beta}_p| |\mathbf{\beta}_\gamma| \approx -1 \times 1 = -1$.
$m_p^2 + 4 E_p E_\gamma = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$.

This equation must hold at the threshold. The threshold energy of the photon depends on the proton's energy, which is not a fixed value.

Maybe the question is about the minimum energy of the photon required for the reaction to occur, irrespective of the proton's energy (as long as it's sufficiently high).

Let's use the result from the proton rest frame. $E_{\gamma, rest} = 151.74$ MeV.
The energy of the CMB photon in the lab frame is $E_{\gamma, lab}$.
We need the threshold energy of the lab frame photon for the reaction to occur.

Consider the invariant mass approach again.
The minimum value of $s$ required for the reaction is $(m_n + m_\pi)^2$.
$s = m_p^2 + 2 E_p E_\gamma (1 + \beta_p)$. Mistake in sign.

The energy of the photon in eV.
$E_{\gamma, rest} = 151.74 \times 10^6$ eV.

The problem statement is about the threshold energy of the photon in the lab frame.
The energy scale of the proton is ultra high.

The threshold condition is given by the invariant mass.
$(P_p + P_\gamma)^2 = (m_n + m_\pi)^2$.
Consider the limit where $E_p \rightarrow \infty$.

Let's use the numbers given.
$m_n + m_\pi = 1079.2$ MeV.
$m_p = 938.3$ MeV.
$(1079.2)^2 = (938.3)^2 + 4 E_p E_\gamma$.
$1164672.64 = 879906.89 + 4 E_p E_\gamma$.
$4 E_p E_\gamma = 284765.75$ MeV$^2$.

The energy threshold of the photon. Consider the situation where the proton has the minimum energy required for the reaction.

Let's use the center of momentum frame.
The energy of the photon in the lab frame needs to be such that the center of mass energy is at least $m_n + m_\pi$.

The threshold energy of the photon in the lab frame.
$E_{\gamma, th} \approx \frac{(m_n^2 - m_p^2)}{2 E_p}$ (for photon absorption).

The energy of the CMB photon is very small.

Let's use the invariant mass approach.
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 c^4 = (P_p + P_\gamma)^2 = m_p^2 c^4 + m_\gamma^2 c^4 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_p \cdot \mathbf{p}_\gamma) c^2$.
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 c^2 = m_p^2 c^2 + 2 (E_p E_\gamma + |\mathbf{p}_p| E_\gamma)$.
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 c^2 - m_p^2 c^2 = 2 E_\gamma (E_p + |\mathbf{p}_p|)$.
For ultra-relativistic proton, $|\mathbf{p}_p| \approx E_p$.
$(m_n + m_\pi)^2 c^2 - m_p^2 c^2 = 4 E_\gamma E_p$.
$E_\gamma = \frac{((m_n + m_\pi)^2 - m_p^2) c^2}{4 E_p}$. This still depends on $E_p$.

Final attempt: Consider the CM frame.
