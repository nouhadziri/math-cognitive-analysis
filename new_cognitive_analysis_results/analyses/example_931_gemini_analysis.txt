Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem describes a pursuit scenario on a 2D coordinate plane. We need to analyze the movement of Tom and Jerry and determine the conditions under which Tom catches Jerry.

Let Tom's position at time $t$ be $(x_t, y_t)$ and Jerry's position at time $t$ be $(j_t^x, j_t^y)$.
Jerry starts at $(0, 0)$ at $t=0$ and moves to the right at $1$ unit per second.
So, Jerry's position at time $t$ is $(t, 0)$.

Tom starts at $(x, y)$ at $t=0$. Let $(x_0, y_0) = (x, y)$.

At each positive integer time $t$:
1. Calculate the distance between Tom and Jerry at the beginning of the time interval, i.e., at time $t-1$.
   Tom's position at $t-1$: $(x_{t-1}, y_{t-1})$
   Jerry's position at $t-1$: $(t-1, 0)$
   Distance $d = \sqrt{(x_{t-1} - (t-1))^2 + (y_{t-1} - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(x_{t-1} - t + 1)^2 + y_{t-1}^2}$

2. If $d \leq 1$, Tom catches Jerry at time $t$. Tom's position at time $t$ becomes Jerry's position at time $t$, which is $(t, 0)$.
   So, $(x_t, y_t) = (t, 0)$.

3. If $d > 1$, Tom hops to the midpoint of his and Jerry's location.
   Midpoint coordinates: $\left( \frac{x_{t-1} + (t-1)}{2}, \frac{y_{t-1} + 0}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{x_{t-1} + t - 1}{2}, \frac{y_{t-1}}{2} \right)$
   So, Tom's position at time $t$ is $(x_t, y_t) = \left( \frac{x_{t-1} + t - 1}{2}, \frac{y_{t-1}}{2} \right)$.

Let's analyze the movement step by step.

Time $t=1$:
Jerry's position: $(1, 0)$
Tom's position at $t=0$: $(x, y)$
Distance at the start of $t=1$: $\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$

Case 1: $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \leq 1$
Tom catches Jerry at $t=1$. Tom's position at $t=1$ is $(1, 0)$.
This implies $n=1$.

Case 2: $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} > 1$
Tom moves to the midpoint of $(x, y)$ and $(0, 0)$.
Tom's position at $t=1$: $(x_1, y_1) = \left( \frac{x+0}{2}, \frac{y+0}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{x}{2}, \frac{y}{2} \right)$

Time $t=2$:
Jerry's position: $(2, 0)$
Tom's position at $t=1$: $(x_1, y_1) = \left( \frac{x}{2}, \frac{y}{2} \right)$
Distance at the start of $t=2$: $\sqrt{\left(\frac{x}{2} - 1\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{2} - 0\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{x-2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2}$

If $\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2} \leq 1$, i.e., $\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2} \leq 2$, Tom catches Jerry at $t=2$.
Tom's position at $t=2$ is $(2, 0)$. This implies $n=2$.

If $\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2} > 1$, i.e., $\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2} > 2$, Tom moves to the midpoint of $(\frac{x}{2}, \frac{y}{2})$ and $(1, 0)$.
Tom's position at $t=2$: $(x_2, y_2) = \left( \frac{\frac{x}{2} + 1}{2}, \frac{\frac{y}{2} + 0}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{x+2}{4}, \frac{y}{4} \right)$

Let's look at the general case when Tom hasn't caught Jerry before time $t$.
Tom's position at time $t-1$: $(x_{t-1}, y_{t-1})$
Jerry's position at time $t-1$: $(t-1, 0)$
Distance at the start of time $t$: $\sqrt{(x_{t-1} - (t-1))^2 + y_{t-1}^2} > 1$

Tom's position at time $t$: $x_t = \frac{x_{t-1} + t - 1}{2}$, $y_t = \frac{y_{t-1}}{2}$

From the recursion for $y_t$, we have $y_t = \frac{y_{t-1}}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{y_{t-2}}{2} \right) = \dots = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^t y_0 = \frac{y}{2^t}$.

Now, let's analyze the recursion for $x_t$.
$2x_t = x_{t-1} + t - 1$
$x_t - \frac{1}{2} x_{t-1} = \frac{t-1}{2}$

Consider the homogeneous part: $h_t - \frac{1}{2} h_{t-1} = 0 \implies h_t = C \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t$.

For the particular solution, let $p_t = At + B$.
$A t + B - \frac{1}{2} (A(t-1) + B) = \frac{t-1}{2}$
$A t + B - \frac{1}{2} A t + \frac{1}{2} A - \frac{1}{2} B = \frac{t-1}{2}$
$\frac{1}{2} A t + (B + \frac{1}{2} A - \frac{1}{2} B) = \frac{1}{2} t - \frac{1}{2}$
Comparing coefficients:
$\frac{1}{2} A = \frac{1}{2} \implies A = 1$
$B + \frac{1}{2} (1) - \frac{1}{2} B = -\frac{1}{2}$
$\frac{1}{2} B + \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{1}{2}$
$\frac{1}{2} B = -1 \implies B = -2$

So, the particular solution is $p_t = t - 2$.

The general solution for $x_t$ is $x_t = C \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t + t - 2$.

Using the initial condition $x_0 = x$:
$x_0 = C \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^0 + 0 - 2 = C - 2$
$x = C - 2 \implies C = x + 2$.

Therefore, $x_t = (x+2) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t + t - 2 = \frac{x+2}{2^t} + t - 2$.

So, if Tom hasn't caught Jerry before time $t$, Tom's position at time $t$ is:
$(x_t, y_t) = \left( \frac{x+2}{2^t} + t - 2, \frac{y}{2^t} \right)$.

Now, consider the catching condition at time $n$.
At time $n$, Tom is within $1$ unit of Jerry's location $(n, 0)$.
Distance between Tom's position at $n-1$ and Jerry's position at $n-1$ is $\leq 1$.
Tom's position at $n-1$: $(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}) = \left( \frac{x+2}{2^{n-1}} + n - 3, \frac{y}{2^{n-1}} \right)$
Jerry's position at $n-1$: $(n-1, 0)$

Distance squared:
$\left( \left( \frac{x+2}{2^{n-1}} + n - 3 \right) - (n-1) \right)^2 + \left( \frac{y}{2^{n-1}} - 0 \right)^2 \leq 1^2$
$\left( \frac{x+2}{2^{n-1}} - 2 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{y}{2^{n-1}} \right)^2 \leq 1$

Let $a = \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$.
$(a(x+2) - 2)^2 + (ay)^2 \leq 1$
$(ax + 2a - 2)^2 + a^2 y^2 \leq 1$

Part (a): Show that $x \geq 0$.

Consider the case when $n=1$.
Tom catches Jerry at $t=1$ if $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \leq 1$. This does not restrict $x \geq 0$.

Let's use proof by contradiction. Assume $x < 0$.

If Tom catches Jerry at time $n$, it means that at time $n$, Tom's position is $(n, 0)$.
This implies that at the start of time $n$, Tom was within $1$ unit of Jerry's position $(n-1, 0)$.

If $n=1$, then at $t=1$, Tom catches Jerry.
Distance at $t=1$: $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \leq 1$.
Example: $x = -0.5, y = 0$. $\sqrt{(-0.5)^2 + 0^2} = 0.5 \leq 1$. Tom catches Jerry at $t=1$.
So, if $n=1$, $x$ can be negative.

Consider the scenario where the catching happens after $t=1$. So $n \geq 2$.
This means that at times $t=1, \dots, n-1$, Tom did not catch Jerry.

If Tom doesn't catch Jerry at time $t$, the distance between Tom at $t-1$ and Jerry at $t-1$ is $> 1$.
For $t=1$: $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} > 1$.

If catching happens at time $n$, then at time $n$, the distance between Tom at $n-1$ and Jerry at $n-1$ is $\leq 1$.
Distance squared at $t=n$: $\left( \frac{x+2}{2^{n-1}} - 2 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{y}{2^{n-1}} \right)^2 \leq 1$.

Consider the case where Tom starts very far to the left, e.g., $x = -100$, $y = 0$.
At $t=1$, distance = $\sqrt{(-100)^2 + 0^2} = 100 > 1$.
Tom moves to $(-50, 0)$. Jerry at $(1, 0)$.
At $t=2$, distance = $\sqrt{(-50 - 1)^2 + 0^2} = 51 > 1$.
Tom moves to $\left( \frac{-50+1}{2}, \frac{0+0}{2} \right) = (-24.5, 0)$. Jerry at $(2, 0)$.

The x-coordinate of Tom at time $t$ is $x_t = \frac{x+2}{2^t} + t - 2$.
If $x < 0$, as $t \to \infty$, $\frac{x+2}{2^t} \to 0$.
So, $x_t \approx t - 2$.

If $x < 0$, consider the moment before catching, at time $n-1$.
Tom's x-coordinate: $x_{n-1} = \frac{x+2}{2^{n-1}} + n - 3$.
Jerry's x-coordinate: $n-1$.

If catching happens at time $n$, then at the start of time $n$, Tom is close to Jerry.
Tom's position at $n-1$: approximately $(n-3, 0)$.
Jerry's position at $n-1$: $(n-1, 0)$.
Distance $\approx \sqrt{(n-3 - (n-1))^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{(-2)^2} = 2$.
This is a contradiction, as the distance should be $\leq 1$.

Let's consider the x-coordinates.
If catching happens at time $n$, then at the start of time $n$, the distance between Tom and Jerry is $\leq 1$.
$|x_{n-1} - (n-1)| \leq 1$, assuming $y=0$.
$\left| \left( \frac{x+2}{2^{n-1}} + n - 3 \right) - (n-1) \right| \leq 1$
$\left| \frac{x+2}{2^{n-1}} - 2 \right| \leq 1$
$-1 \leq \frac{x+2}{2^{n-1}} - 2 \leq 1$
$1 \leq \frac{x+2}{2^{n-1}} \leq 3$

If $n=1$, $1 \leq x+2 \leq 3$, so $-1 \leq x \leq 1$.

If $n \geq 2$, $2^{n-1} \leq x+2 \leq 3 \cdot 2^{n-1}$.
$2^{n-1} - 2 \leq x \leq 3 \cdot 2^{n-1} - 2$.

If $n=2$, $2^1 - 2 \leq x \leq 3 \cdot 2^1 - 2 \implies 0 \leq x \leq 4$.
If $n=3$, $2^2 - 2 \leq x \leq 3 \cdot 2^2 - 2 \implies 2 \leq x \leq 10$.

If Tom catches Jerry, then at some point, Tom gets close enough.
Consider the movement of the x-coordinates.
If Tom doesn't catch Jerry, $x_t = \frac{x+2}{2^t} + t - 2$.
If $x < 0$, and $|x|$ is large, $x_t$ can be negative for a while.

Let's analyze the first step carefully.
If Tom catches at $t=1$, then $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \leq 1$.

If Tom does not catch at $t=1$, Tom moves to $(\frac{x}{2}, \frac{y}{2})$.
At $t=2$, catching happens if $\sqrt{(\frac{x}{2} - 1)^2 + (\frac{y}{2})^2} \leq 1$.
$\frac{1}{4} ((x-2)^2 + y^2) \leq 1$
$(x-2)^2 + y^2 \leq 4$.

Example from the problem: Tom starts at $(3, 2)$.
$t=1$: Distance = $\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{13} > 1$.
Tom moves to $(\frac{3}{2}, 1)$. Jerry at $(1, 0)$.
Distance at start of $t=2$: $\sqrt{(\frac{3}{2} - 1)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(\frac{1}{2})^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + 1} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{4}} > 1$.
Mistake in the example. Tom is within 1 unit of Jerry.
Distance between $(3, 2)$ and $(0, 0)$ is $\sqrt{13} > 1$.
Tom moves to $(\frac{3}{2}, 1)$. Jerry at $(1, 0)$.
Distance between Tom at $t=1$ and Jerry at $t=1$:
$\sqrt{(\frac{3}{2} - 1)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(\frac{1}{2})^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{4}} > 1$.
The example statement seems incorrect based on the rules.

Let's recalculate the example:
Tom at $(3, 2)$, Jerry at $(0, 0)$.
$t=1$: Distance = $\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{13} > 1$.
Tom moves to midpoint: $(\frac{3}{2}, 1)$. Jerry at $(1, 0)$.

At time $t=1$, if Tom is within 1 unit of Jerry's location at $t=1$, catch happens.
Jerry at $t=1$: $(1, 0)$.
Distance between Tom at $t=0$ and Jerry at $t=1$: $\sqrt{(3-1)^2 + (2-0)^2} = \sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{8} > 1$.

Rule: At each positive integer time $t$, if Tom is within 1 unit of Jerry's location, he catches.
This means at the beginning of the time interval $t$.
If distance between Tom at $t-1$ and Jerry at $t-1$ is $\leq 1$.

Example again:
Tom starts at $(3, 2)$, Jerry at $(0, 0)$.

$t=1$: Tom at $(3, 2)$, Jerry at $(0, 0)$. Distance = $\sqrt{13} > 1$.
Tom moves to midpoint of $(3, 2)$ and $(0, 0)$, which is $(\frac{3}{2}, 1)$.

$t=2$: Tom at $(\frac{3}{2}, 1)$, Jerry at $(1, 0)$.
Distance = $\sqrt{(\frac{3}{2} - 1)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(\frac{1}{2})^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{4}} > 1$.
Tom moves to midpoint of $(\frac{3}{2}, 1)$ and $(1, 0)$, which is $(\frac{\frac{3}{2}+1}{2}, \frac{1+0}{2}) = (\frac{5}{4}, \frac{1}{2})$.

Seems the example in the problem statement is wrong based on the rules given.
Assuming the rules are correct:

If Tom catches Jerry at time $n$, then at the start of time $n$, distance $\leq 1$.
Distance between Tom at $n-1$ and Jerry at $n-1$ is $\leq 1$.
$\sqrt{(x_{n-1} - (n-1))^2 + y_{n-1}^2} \leq 1$.

If $n=1$, distance between Tom at $0$ and Jerry at $0$ is $\leq 1$.
$\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2} \leq 1 \implies x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$.

If $n \geq 2$, then at times $1, \dots, n-1$, Tom did not catch Jerry.
This means for $t=1, \dots, n-1$, distance between Tom at $t-1$ and Jerry at $t-1$ is $> 1$.

Part (a): Show $x \geq 0$.
If $x < 0$, let $x = -a$, where $a > 0$.
If $n=1$, $a^2 + y^2 \leq 1$. Possible with negative $x$.

Consider the case when catching happens at $n \geq 2$.
Distance at $t=1$: $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} > 1$.
Tom moves to $(\frac{x}{2}, \frac{y}{2})$.

Distance at the start of $t=2$: $\sqrt{(\frac{x}{2} - 1)^2 + (\frac{y}{2})^2} \leq 1$.
$(x-2)^2 + y^2 \leq 4$.

If $x < 0$, let $x = -1$.
$(-1-2)^2 + y^2 \leq 4 \implies 9 + y^2 \leq 4$, impossible.
So, if catching happens at $t=2$, and $x < 0$, there is a contradiction.

If $x < 0$, and catching happens at time $n$.
If $n=1$, ok.
If $n=2$, contradiction.

If $n=3$, then catching at $t=3$, not at $t=1, 2$.
At $t=1$, $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} > 1$. Tom at $(\frac{x}{2}, \frac{y}{2})$.
At $t=2$, distance between $(\frac{x}{2}, \frac{y}{2})$ and $(1, 0)$ is $> 1$.
$(\frac{x}{2} - 1)^2 + (\frac{y}{2})^2 > 1 \implies (x-2)^2 + y^2 > 4$.

At $t=3$, distance between Tom at $t=2$ and Jerry at $t=2$ is $\leq 1$.
Tom at $t=2$: $(\frac{x+2}{4}, \frac{y}{4})$. Jerry at $t=2$: $(2, 0)$.
$(\frac{x+2}{4} - 2)^2 + (\frac{y}{4})^2 \leq 1$
$(x+2 - 8)^2 + y^2 \leq 16$
$(x-6)^2 + y^2 \leq 16$.

If $x < 0$, e.g., $x=-1$.
$(-1-2)^2 + y^2 > 4 \implies 9 + y^2 > 4$.
$(-1-6)^2 + y^2 \leq 16 \implies 49 + y^2 \leq 16$, impossible.

This suggests $x \geq 0$.

Part (b): Find the maximum possible value of $\frac{y}{x+1}$.

Consider the case when catching happens at $t=1$.
$x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$.
We want to maximize $\frac{y}{x+1}$ subject to $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$.
Let $k = \frac{y}{x+1}$, so $y = k(x+1)$.
$x^2 + k^2 (x+1)^2 \leq 1$.
$x^2 + k^2 (x^2 + 2x + 1) \leq 1$.
$(1+k^2) x^2 + 2k^2 x + k^2 - 1 \leq 0$.
Quadratic inequality in $x$. For this to have solutions, the discriminant must be $\geq 0$.
$(2k^2)^2 - 4(1+k^2)(k^2 - 1) \geq 0$.
$4k^4 - 4(k^4 - 1) \geq 0$.
$4k^4 - 4k^4 + 4 \geq 0$.
$4 \geq 0$.

Consider the boundary $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.
Maximize $\frac{y}{x+1}$.
Using Lagrange multipliers: $f(x, y) = \frac{y}{x+1}$, $g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0$.
$\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$.
$\frac{(x+1) \cdot 1 - y \cdot 1}{(x+1)^2} = \lambda (2x) \implies \frac{x+1-y}{(x+1)^2} = 2 \lambda x$.
$\frac{1 \cdot (x+1) - y \cdot 0}{(x+1)^2} = \frac{1}{x+1}$.
$\frac{1}{x+1} = \lambda (2y)$.

$\frac{x+1-y}{(x+1)^2} / \frac{1}{x+1} = \frac{2 \lambda x}{2 \lambda y} = \frac{x}{y}$.
$\frac{x+1-y}{x+1} = \frac{x}{y}$.
$y(x+1-y) = x(x+1)$.
$xy + y - y^2 = x^2 + x$.
$y - y^2 = x^2 - xy + x$.

If $x=0$, $y - y^2 = 0 \implies y(1-y) = 0 \implies y=0$ or $y=1$.
If $y=0$, $0 = x^2 + x \implies x(x+1) = 0 \implies x=0$ or $x=-1$.

Points on the circle: $(0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1)$.
Values of $\frac{y}{x+1}$:
$(0, 1) \implies \frac{1}{0+1} = 1$.
$(1, 0) \implies \frac{0}{1+1} = 0$.

They use the method of undetermined coefficients, assuming a linear form for the particular solution and determining the coefficients by substitution. This shows sophisticated understanding of difference equation solving techniques.</explanation>

<start>3347</start>
<end>3536</end>
<text>So, the particular solution is $p_t = t - 2$.

The general solution for $x_t$ is $x_t = C \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t + t - 2$.

Using the initial condition $x_0 = x$:
$x_0 = C \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^0 + 0 - 2 = C - 2$
$x = C - 2 \implies C = x + 2$.</text>
<explanation>The solver combines the homogeneous and particular solutions, then applies the initial condition to determine the constant of integration. This demonstrates the complete process of solving a difference equation with initial conditions.</explanation>

<skill>Case Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to systematically break down a problem into distinct scenarios or cases, analyzing each separately to build toward a comprehensive solution.</definition>

<start>1005</start>
<end>1572</end>
<text>Let's analyze the movement step by step.

Time $t=1$:
Jerry's position: $(1, 0)$
Tom's position at $t=0$: $(x, y)$
Distance at the start of $t=1$: $\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$

Case 1: $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \leq 1$
Tom catches Jerry at $t=1$. Tom's position at $t=1$ is $(1, 0)$.
This implies $n=1$.

Case 2: $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} > 1$
Tom moves to the midpoint of $(x, y)$ and $(0, 0)$.
Tom's position at $t=1$: $(x_1, y_1) = \left( \frac{x+0}{2}, \frac{y+0}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{x}{2}, \frac{y}{2} \right)$</text>
<explanation>The solver breaks down the problem by examining what happens at specific time points, starting with t=1. They identify two distinct cases based on the initial distance between Tom and Jerry, and analyze each separately. This systematic approach to considering different scenarios is a hallmark of case analysis.</explanation>

<start>1574</start>
<end>2096</end>
<text>Time $t=2$:
Jerry's position: $(2, 0)$
Tom's position at $t=1$: $(x_1, y_1) = \left( \frac{x}{2}, \frac{y}{2} \right)$
Distance at the start of $t=2$: $\sqrt{\left(\frac{x}{2} - 1\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{2} - 0\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{x-2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2}$

If $\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2} \leq 1$, i.e., $\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2} \leq 2$, Tom catches Jerry at $t=2$.
Tom's position at $t=2$ is $(2, 0)$. This implies $n=2$.

If $\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2} > 1$, i.e., $\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2} > 2$, Tom moves to the midpoint of $(\frac{x}{2}, \frac{y}{2})$ and $(1, 0)$.
Tom's position at $t=2$: $(x_2, y_2) = \left( \frac{\frac{x}{2} + 1}{2}, \frac{\frac{y}{2} + 0}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{x+2}{4}, \frac{y}{4} \right)$</text>
<explanation>The solver continues the case analysis for t=2, again identifying two distinct scenarios based on whether Tom catches Jerry at this time point. For each case, they determine Tom's position and the implications. This methodical approach to examining different cases builds a comprehensive understanding of the problem.</explanation>

<skill>Proof by Contradiction</skill>
<definition>A logical technique where one assumes the opposite of what is to be proven, and then shows that this assumption leads to a logical contradiction, thereby proving the original statement.</definition>

<start>5021</start>
<end>5059</end>
<text>Let's use proof by contradiction. Assume $x < 0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver explicitly states they will use proof by contradiction to show that x ≥ 0 by assuming the opposite and working toward a contradiction.</explanation>

<start>6802</start>
<end>7175</end>
<text>If $x < 0$, and catching happens at time $n$.
If $n=1$, ok.
If $n=2$, contradiction.

If $n=3$, then catching at $t=3$, not at $t=1, 2$.
At $t=1$, $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} > 1$. Tom at $(\frac{x}{2}, \frac{y}{2})$.
At $t=2$, distance between $(\frac{x}{2}, \frac{y}{2})$ and $(1, 0)$ is $> 1$.
$(\frac{x}{2} - 1)^2 + (\frac{y}{2})^2 > 1 \implies (x-2)^2 + y^2 > 4$.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes different cases where Tom catches Jerry at different times, showing that for n=2, assuming x<0 leads to a contradiction. This is a systematic application of the proof by contradiction method.</explanation>

<start>7177</start>
<end>7445</end>
<text>At $t=3$, distance between Tom at $t=2$ and Jerry at $t=2$ is $\leq 1$.
Tom at $t=2$: $(\frac{x+2}{4}, \frac{y}{4})$. Jerry at $t=2$: $(2, 0)$.
$(\frac{x+2}{4} - 2)^2 + (\frac{y}{4})^2 \leq 1$
$(x+2 - 8)^2 + y^2 \leq 16$
$(x-6)^2 + y^2 \leq 16$.</text>
<explanation>The solver continues examining the case where n=3, setting up the constraints that would need to be satisfied for Tom to catch Jerry at this time.</explanation>

<start>7447</start>
<end>7625</end>
<text>If $x < 0$, e.g., $x=-1$.
$(-1-2)^2 + y^2 > 4 \implies 9 + y^2 > 4$.
$(-1-6)^2 + y^2 \leq 16 \implies 49 + y^2 \leq 16$, impossible.</text>
<explanation>The solver tests a specific negative value of x and shows that it leads to a contradiction—an impossible inequality that cannot be satisfied. This completes the proof by contradiction for this case.</explanation>

<skill>Optimization Techniques</skill>
<definition>The ability to find maximum or minimum values of functions subject to constraints, using methods such as Lagrange multipliers or analyzing boundary conditions.</definition>

<start>7655</start>
<end>7847</end>
<text>Consider the case when catching happens at $t=1$.
$x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$.
We want to maximize $\frac{y}{x+1}$ subject to $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$.
Let $k = \frac{y}{x+1}$, so $y = k(x+1)$.</text>
<explanation>The solver formulates the optimization problem clearly, identifying the objective function to maximize (y/(x+1)) and the constraint (x²+y²≤1). They introduce a substitution to simplify the analysis, showing strategic problem-solving.</explanation>

<start>8219</start>
<end>8553</end>
<text>Consider the boundary $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.
Maximize $\frac{y}{x+1}$.
Using Lagrange multipliers: $f(x, y) = \frac{y}{x+1}$, $g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0$.
$\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$.
$\frac{(x+1) \cdot 1 - y \cdot 1}{(x+1)^2} = \lambda (2x) \implies \frac{x+1-y}{(x+1)^2} = 2 \lambda x$.
$\frac{1 \cdot (x+1) - y \cdot 0}{(x+1)^2} = \frac{1}{x+1}$.
$\frac{1}{x+1} = \lambda (2y)$.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the method of Lagrange multipliers, a sophisticated optimization technique for constrained problems. They correctly set up the Lagrangian function, compute the necessary partial derivatives, and establish the system of equations that characterize the optimal points.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to transform mathematical expressions through operations such as substitution, expansion, factoring, and equation solving to derive new relationships or simplify complex expressions.</definition>
