Problem:
Given a positive integer  $k$ , find the least integer  $n_k$  for which there exist five sets  $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5$  with the following properties:
\[|S_j|=k \text{ for } j=1, \cdots , 5 , \quad |\bigcup_{j=1}^{5} S_j | = n_k ;\]
\[|S_i \cap S_{i+1}| = 0 = |S_5 \cap S_1|, \quad \text{for } i=1,\cdots ,4 \]

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Define the sets and their properties:**
   We are given five sets \( S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5 \) each of size \( k \) such that:
   \[
   |S_j| = k \quad \text{for } j = 1, \ldots, 5
   \]
   and
   \[
   |\bigcup_{j=1}^{5} S_j | = n_k
   \]
   Additionally, the sets have the property:
   \[
   |S_i \cap S_{i+1}| = 0 \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, 4 \quad \text{and} \quad |S_5 \cap S_1| = 0
   \]

2. **Introduce variables for intersections:**
   Let:
   \[
   a_{13} = |S_1 \cap S_3|, \quad a_{35} = |S_3 \cap S_5|, \quad a_{52} = |S_5 \cap S_2|, \quad a_{24} = |S_2 \cap S_4|, \quad a_{41} = |S_4 \cap S_1|
   \]
   Define:
   \[
   b_1 = |S_1 \setminus (S_1 \cap S_3) \setminus (S_4 \cap S_1)|
   \]
   and similarly for \( b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5 \).

3. **Set up the equations:**
   From the problem conditions, we have:
   \[
   b_1 + a_{13} + a_{41} = k
   \]
   and similarly for the other sets. Summing these equations, we get:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i + 2 \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 5k
   \]

4. **Express \( n_k \) in terms of \( b_i \) and \( a_{ij} \):**
   The total number of elements in the union of the sets is:
   \[
   n_k = \sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i + \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij}
   \]

5. **Minimize \( n_k \):**
   From the equation:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i + 2 \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 5k
   \]
   we need to minimize \( \sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i \). 

6. **Case 1: \( k \) is even:**
   Let \( k = 2\ell \). We can take all \( a_{ij} = \ell \). Then:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 5\ell
   \]
   and:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i = 5k - 2 \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 5k - 2 \cdot 5\ell = 5k - 5k = 0
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   n_k = 5\ell = \frac{5k}{2}
   \]

7. **Case 2: \( k \) is odd:**
   Let \( k = 2\ell + 1 \). We can take \( a_{13} = a_{52} = a_{41} = \ell \) and \( a_{35} = a_{24} = \ell + 1 \). Then:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 3\ell + 2(\ell + 1) = 5\ell + 2
   \]
   and:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i = 5k - 2 \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 5(2\ell + 1) - 2(5\ell + 2) = 10\ell + 5 - 10\ell - 4 = 1
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   n_k = 5\ell + 3 = \frac{5k + 1}{2}
   \]

8. **Combine the results:**
   In one closed formula:
   \[
   \min n_k = \left\lfloor \frac{5k + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lceil \frac{5k}{2} \right\rceil
   \]

The final answer is \( \boxed{ \left\lceil \frac{5k}{2} \right\rceil } \).

   Let:
   \[
   a_{13} = |S_1 \cap S_3|, \quad a_{35} = |S_3 \cap S_5|, \quad a_{52} = |S_5 \cap S_2|, \quad a_{24} = |S_2 \cap S_4|, \quad a_{41} = |S_4 \cap S_1|

   From the problem conditions, we have:
   \[
   b_1 + a_{13} + a_{41} = k
   \]
   and similarly for the other sets. Summing these equations, we get:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i + 2 \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 5k
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver formulates equations that relate the introduced variables to the given conditions.

This demonstrates the ability to translate set relationships into algebraic equations.</explanation>

<start>932</start>
<end>1076</end>
<text>4. **Express \( n_k \) in terms of \( b_i \) and \( a_{ij} \):**
   The total number of elements in the union of the sets is:
   \[
   n_k = \sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i + \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij}
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver formulates an equation for n_k (the quantity to be minimized) in terms of the previously introduced variables. This shows the ability to express the objective function in terms of the problem variables.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Optimization</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify what needs to be optimized in a problem and develop a strategy to achieve the optimal solution, often by manipulating equations or identifying key constraints.</definition>

<start>1078</start>

<text>5. **Minimize \( n_k \):**
   From the equation:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i + 2 \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 5k
   \]
   we need to minimize \( \sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i \).</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that to minimize n_k, they need to minimize the sum of b_i values, given the constraint equation. This demonstrates strategic thinking about optimization, identifying the key relationship that will lead to the minimum value.</explanation>

<skill>Case Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to break down a problem into distinct cases based on different possible scenarios or parameter values, and then analyze each case separately.</definition>

<start>1226</start>
<end>1504</end>
<text>6. **Case 1: \( k \) is even:**
   Let \( k = 2\ell \). We can take all \( a_{ij} = \ell \). Then:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 5\ell
   \]
   and:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i = 5k - 2 \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 5k - 2 \cdot 5\ell = 5k - 5k = 0
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   n_k = 5\ell = \frac{5k}{2}
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver divides the analysis into cases, starting with when k is even. They set k = 2ℓ and assign values to the intersection variables to minimize the sum of b_i. This demonstrates the ability to recognize that different parameter values may require different solution approaches.</explanation>

<start>1506</start>
<end>1927</end>
<text>7. **Case 2: \( k \) is odd:**
   Let \( k = 2\ell + 1 \). We can take \( a_{13} = a_{52} = a_{41} = \ell \) and \( a_{35} = a_{24} = \ell + 1 \). Then:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 3\ell + 2(\ell + 1) = 5\ell + 2
   \]
   and:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i = 5k - 2 \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 5(2\ell + 1) - 2(5\ell + 2) = 10\ell + 5 - 10\ell - 4 = 1
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   n_k = 5\ell + 3 = \frac{5k + 1}{2}
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver continues with the case where k is odd, using k = 2ℓ+1 and assigning different values to the intersection variables. This further demonstrates case analysis, showing how the approach needs to be adapted for odd values of k to achieve the minimum possible value of n_k.</explanation>

   In one closed formula:
   \[
   \min n_k = \left\lfloor \frac{5k + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lceil \frac{5k}{2} \right\rceil
   \]</text>
<explanation>After analyzing both even and odd cases, the solver recognizes a pattern and generalizes it into a single formula that works for all values of k. This demonstrates the ability to abstract from specific cases to a general rule, using floor and ceiling functions to handle the even/odd distinction elegantly.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Verification</skill>
<definition>The ability to check that a proposed solution satisfies all the conditions of the problem and is indeed optimal.</definition>

<start>1506</start>

   Let \( k = 2\ell + 1 \). We can take \( a_{13} = a_{52} = a_{41} = \ell \) and \( a_{35} = a_{24} = \ell + 1 \). Then:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 3\ell + 2(\ell + 1) = 5\ell + 2
   \]
   and:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i = 5k - 2 \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 5(2\ell + 1) - 2(5\ell + 2) = 10\ell + 5 - 10\ell - 4 = 1
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   n_k = 5\ell + 3 = \frac{5k + 1}{2}
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies their approach by checking that their assignment of values to variables satisfies all constraints. They calculate the sum of b_i values and confirm it's minimized (equals 1 for odd k), which proves the optimality of their solution. This demonstrates mathematical verification through algebraic manipulation and substitution.</explanation>

   \]
   and:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i = 5k - 2 \sum_{i=1,3,5,2,4} a_{ij} = 5k - 2 \cdot 5\ell = 5k - 5k = 0
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   n_k = 5\ell = \frac{5k}{2}
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver manipulates algebraic expressions to derive relationships between variables. They substitute k = 2ℓ and a_ij = ℓ into their equations, then perform algebraic operations to simplify and reach the conclusion that n_k = 5k/2 for even k. This demonstrates proficiency in symbolic manipulation and algebraic simplification.</explanation>

<start>2079</start>
<end>2130</end>
<text>The final answer is \( \boxed{ \left\lceil \frac{5k}{2} \right\rceil } \).</text>
