Domain: Combinatorics

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks about the configuration of two identical galvanometers and two identical resistors to achieve maximum voltage range and maximum current range for one of the galvanometers.

Let the internal resistance of each galvanometer be $r_g = R_{\mathrm{C}}$.
We are given $r_g < R/2$.

Maximum voltage range for a galvanometer means using it as a voltmeter with a large series resistance.
Maximum current range for a galvanometer means using it as an ammeter with a small parallel resistance (shunt).

Consider the configurations:

**Configuration 1: All components in series**
The circuit consists of G1 - R - G2 - R in series.
The total resistance of the circuit is $r_g + R + r_g + R = 2r_g + 2R$.
The current through the circuit is $I$.
The voltage across one galvanometer (G1) is $V_{G1} = I r_g$.
The voltage across one resistor is $V_R = I R$.

To measure the voltage range of one galvanometer (say G1), we need to consider the maximum current $I_g$ that the galvanometer can handle. The maximum voltage across G1 would be $V_{max, G1} = I_g r_g$.

If the circuit is connected to a voltage source $V$, then $V = I (2r_g + 2R)$, so $I = V / (2r_g + 2R)$.
The voltage across G1 is $V_{G1} = \frac{V}{2r_g + 2R} r_g$.

To maximize the voltage range of one galvanometer when used in a circuit, we need to connect a large resistance in series with it.

Let's analyze statement (A): The maximum voltage range is obtained when all the components are connected in series.

Consider one galvanometer and additional resistance to convert it into a voltmeter. The voltage range is $V = I_g (r_g + R_{series})$. To maximize $V$, $R_{series}$ should be large.

In the series configuration (G1 - R - G2 - R), if we consider G1 as the meter, the effective series resistance is $R + r_g + R = 2R + r_g$.
The maximum voltage that can be measured by this setup, considering the full-scale deflection current $I_g$ of the galvanometer, depends on how the measurement is being done. If the entire series circuit is connected to a voltage source, the voltage across G1 is limited by the current in the circuit.

Let the full-scale deflection current of the galvanometer be $I_g$.
When used as a voltmeter, a large resistance is added in series.
Voltage range $V_{range} = I_g (r_g + R_{series})$.

In configuration (A), if we consider one galvanometer (G1) and the rest of the circuit as the series resistance, $R_{series} = R + r_g + R = 2R + r_g$.
Voltage range of G1 (as a voltmeter) = $I_g (r_g + 2R + r_g) = I_g (2r_g + 2R)$.

**Configuration 2: Two resistors and one galvanometer in series, and the second galvanometer in parallel to the first.**
The setup is (R - G1 - R) in one branch, and G2 in parallel to this branch.

The resistance of the series branch is $R + r_g + R = 2R + r_g$.
The resistance of the parallel galvanometer branch is $r_g$.

The equivalent resistance of the parallel combination is $\frac{(2R + r_g) r_g}{(2R + r_g) + r_g} = \frac{2Rr_g + r_g^2}{2R + 2r_g}$.

If a voltage $V$ is applied across this combination, the current in the G2 branch is $I_{G2} = V / r_g$.
The current in the (R - G1 - R) branch is $I_{series} = V / (2R + r_g)$.

For maximum voltage range of one galvanometer (say G1), we need to use it as a voltmeter.

Consider the voltage across the (R - G1 - R) branch. The maximum current through G1 is $I_g$.
If the current in this branch is $I_g$, the voltage across the branch is $V_{branch} = I_g (2R + r_g)$.
This is the maximum voltage that can be applied across this part of the circuit without exceeding the galvanometer's current rating.

Now, consider the voltage across G1 itself in this scenario.
The current through the (R - G1 - R) series is the same.
The voltage across G1 is $V_{G1} = I_{series} r_g$.

If G1 is used as a voltmeter, we need to connect it in parallel to the component whose voltage is being measured. This interpretation seems incorrect for finding the maximum voltage range of the galvanometer itself.

Let's re-interpret the question: "which of the following statement(s) about any one of the galvanometers is(are) true?" refers to the maximum voltage that can be measured using that galvanometer.

Consider using one galvanometer as a voltmeter. To maximize its range, connect a large series resistance.

In configuration (A), for G1, the effective series resistance is $R + r_g + R = 2R + r_g$.
Maximum voltage range of G1 (as a voltmeter) = $I_g (r_g + 2R + r_g) = I_g (2r_g + 2R)$.

In configuration (B), consider G1. It is in series with two resistors. If used as a voltmeter, the additional series resistance is $2R$.
Maximum voltage range of G1 = $I_g (r_g + 2R)$.

Comparing the voltage ranges from (A) and (B) for G1:
Range (A) = $I_g (2r_g + 2R)$
Range (B) = $I_g (r_g + 2R)$
Since $r_g > 0$, Range (A) > Range (B).

So, statement (B) is likely false if statement (A) is interpreted correctly.

Let's confirm the interpretation of "maximum voltage range obtained for any one of the galvanometers". It means using that galvanometer as a voltmeter with the given external components.

Statement (A): The galvanometer is used in a circuit where the total series resistance is $2R + r_g$. The voltage across the galvanometer at full-scale deflection is $I_g r_g$. If we consider the galvanometer alone as a voltmeter, the series resistance is $2R + r_g$.

Now, let's analyze statement (C): The maximum current range is obtained when all the components are connected in parallel.

Parallel connection:
G1 || R || G2 || R

The equivalent resistance of the circuit:
$\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{r_g} + \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{r_g} + \frac{1}{R} = \frac{2}{r_g} + \frac{2}{R} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{r_g} + \frac{1}{R} \right) = 2 \frac{R + r_g}{R r_g}$
$R_{eq} = \frac{R r_g}{2 (R + r_g)}$

To measure current range, the galvanometer is used as an ammeter with a shunt resistance.
Current range = $I_g \left( 1 + \frac{r_g}{R_{shunt}} \right)$. To maximize the range, $R_{shunt}$ should be small.

Consider one galvanometer (G1) in the parallel circuit. The current through G1 is part of the total current.
Let the total current be $I_{total}$.
The voltage across the parallel components is the same, $V$.
$I_{G1} = V / r_g$
$I_{R1} = V / R$
$I_{G2} = V / r_g$
$I_{R2} = V / R$
$I_{total} = I_{G1} + I_{R1} + I_{G2} + I_{R2} = \frac{V}{r_g} + \frac{V}{R} + \frac{V}{r_g} + \frac{V}{R} = 2V \left( \frac{1}{r_g} + \frac{1}{R} \right)$

If G1 is used as an ammeter, a shunt resistance is connected in parallel.

In configuration (C), if we consider G1 as the ammeter and the rest as part of the circuit affecting the shunt, the interpretation is tricky.

Let's consider the current division in the parallel circuit when the total current causes full-scale deflection in G1 ($I_{G1} = I_g$).
If $I_{G1} = I_g$, then $V = I_g r_g$.
The currents in other branches:
$I_{R1} = I_g r_g / R$
$I_{G2} = I_g r_g / r_g = I_g$
$I_{R2} = I_g r_g / R$
Total current $I_{total} = I_g + \frac{I_g r_g}{R} + I_g + \frac{I_g r_g}{R} = 2 I_g \left( 1 + \frac{r_g}{R} \right)$.

This is the maximum current that can flow through the circuit such that G1 shows full-scale deflection.

Now, consider using G1 as an ammeter with a shunt.
Current range = $I_g \left( 1 + \frac{r_g}{R_{shunt}} \right)$.

In configuration (C), for G1, the effective shunt resistance due to the parallel combination of the other components (R, G2, R) needs to be considered.
The resistance of the parallel combination of R, G2, R is:
$\frac{1}{R_{parallel}} = \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{r_g} + \frac{1}{R} = \frac{2}{R} + \frac{1}{r_g} = \frac{2r_g + R}{Rr_g}$
$R_{parallel} = \frac{Rr_g}{2r_g + R}$.

The current range when G1 is shunted by this parallel combination is:
Range = $I_g \left( 1 + \frac{r_g}{R_{parallel}} \right) = I_g \left( 1 + \frac{r_g}{\frac{Rr_g}{2r_g + R}} \right) = I_g \left( 1 + \frac{r_g (2r_g + R)}{Rr_g} \right)$
Range = $I_g \left( 1 + \frac{2r_g + R}{R} \right) = I_g \left( \frac{R + 2r_g + R}{R} \right) = I_g \left( \frac{2R + 2r_g}{R} \right) = 2 I_g \left( 1 + \frac{r_g}{R} \right)$.

This matches the earlier calculation.

Statement (D): The maximum current range is obtained when the two galvanometers are connected in series and the combination is connected in parallel with both the resistors.

Configuration (D): (G1 - G2) in series, this combination in parallel with R, and also in parallel with R.
Series combination of galvanometers: resistance $r_g + r_g = 2r_g$.
This combination is in parallel with two resistors R.

Circuit:
      (G1 - G2)
       |
   ----|----
   |       |
   R       R

Equivalent resistance of the circuit:
The two resistors in parallel have resistance $R/2$.
The resistance of the galvanometer branch is $2r_g$.
The equivalent resistance of the entire circuit is the parallel combination of $2r_g$ and $R/2$:
$R_{eq} = \frac{2r_g \times (R/2)}{2r_g + R/2} = \frac{r_g R}{\frac{4r_g + R}{2}} = \frac{2 r_g R}{4r_g + R}$.

Consider one galvanometer (G1) as the ammeter.
The shunt resistance for G1 is the resistance of the rest of the circuit connected in parallel to it.

Let's find the current through the (G1 - G2) branch.
If a total current $I_{total}$ enters the parallel combination, it divides between the galvanometer branch and the resistor branches.
The voltage across the parallel branches is the same.

Let the voltage be $V$.
Current through (G1 - G2) branch: $I_{GG} = V / (2r_g)$.
Current through one resistor branch: $I_R = V / R$.
Since there are two resistor branches, total current through resistors = $2 V / R$.

$I_{total} = I_{GG} + 2 I_R = \frac{V}{2r_g} + \frac{2V}{R} = V \left( \frac{1}{2r_g} + \frac{2}{R} \right) = V \frac{R + 4r_g}{2r_g R}$.

Consider the current through G1. In the series combination, the current through G1 is the same as the current through the (G1 - G2) branch, which is $I_{GG}$.

If G1 is used as an ammeter, the shunt resistance is the equivalent resistance of the rest of the circuit connected in parallel to G1.
The rest of the circuit consists of G2 in series with the parallel combination of the two resistors.
Resistance of parallel resistors = $R/2$.
Resistance of shunt for G1 = $r_g + R/2 = \frac{2r_g + R}{2}$.

Current range of G1 = $I_g \left( 1 + \frac{r_g}{R_{shunt}} \right) = I_g \left( 1 + \frac{r_g}{\frac{2r_g + R}{2}} \right) = I_g \left( 1 + \frac{2r_g}{2r_g + R} \right)$
Range = $I_g \left( \frac{2r_g + R + 2r_g}{2r_g + R} \right) = I_g \left( \frac{4r_g + R}{2r_g + R} \right)$.

Comparing current ranges from (C) and (D):
Range (C) = $2 I_g \left( 1 + \frac{r_g}{R} \right) = 2 I_g \frac{R + r_g}{R}$.
Range (D) = $I_g \frac{4r_g + R}{2r_g + R}$.

We need to determine which is larger.
Consider the ratio: $\frac{\text{Range (C)}}{\text{Range (D)}} = \frac{2 I_g (R + r_g) / R}{I_g (4r_g + R) / (2r_g + R)} = \frac{2 (R + r_g) (2r_g + R)}{R (4r_g + R)}$
Ratio = $\frac{2 (2Rr_g + R^2 + 2r_g^2 + Rr_g)}{4Rr_g + R^2} = \frac{2 (3Rr_g + R^2 + 2r_g^2)}{4Rr_g + R^2} = \frac{6Rr_g + 2R^2 + 4r_g^2}{4Rr_g + R^2}$.

We are given $r_g < R/2$, so $2r_g < R$.

Let's test with some values. If $r_g = 1, R = 4$.
Numerator = $6(4)(1) + 2(4)^2 + 4(1)^2 = 24 + 32 + 4 = 60$.
Denominator = $4(4)(1) + 4^2 = 16 + 16 = 32$.
Ratio = $60/32 > 1$. So Range (C) > Range (D).

Maximum current range is obtained when all components are in parallel (statement C).

Now, let's revisit the voltage range.

Statement (A): Maximum voltage range when all components are in series.
Consider G1 as a voltmeter. The series resistance is $R + r_g + R = 2R + r_g$.
Voltage range = $I_g (r_g + 2R + r_g) = I_g (2r_g + 2R)$.

Statement (B): Maximum voltage range when two resistors and one galvanometer are in series, and the second galvanometer is in parallel to the first.
Consider G1 as the galvanometer. The effective series resistance for G1 as a voltmeter is $2R$.
Voltage range = $I_g (r_g + 2R)$.

Since $r_g > 0$, range in (A) > range in (B).
So, statement (A) is likely true.

Let's confirm the understanding of "maximum voltage range... about any one of the galvanometers". This refers to the maximum voltage that can be measured by that galvanometer when used as a voltmeter with the other components acting as series resistance.

Final check of the statements:
(A) Maximum voltage range when all components in series.
For G1, series resistance = $2R + r_g$. Range = $I_g (2r_g + 2R)$.

(B) Maximum voltage range when two resistors and one galvanometer in series, second galvanometer in parallel.
For G1, series resistance = $2R$. Range = $I_g (r_g + 2R)$.

Comparing (A) and (B), (A) gives a larger voltage range.

(C) Maximum current range when all components in parallel.
For G1, shunt resistance $R_{parallel} = \frac{Rr_g}{2r_g + R}$.
Current range = $2 I_g \left( 1 + \frac{r_g}{R} \right)$.

(D) Maximum current range when two galvanometers in series, combination in parallel with both resistors.
For G1, shunt resistance $\frac{2r_g + R}{2}$.
Current range = $I_g \frac{4r_g + R}{2r_g + R}$.

We found that Range (C) > Range (D).

So, statements (A) and (C) seem to be true.
