Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let the given property be P.
P: For any $a, b \in G$, if $a^2b = ba^2$, then $ab = ba$.

i) Assume that $|G| = 2^n$ for some integer $n \ge 0$. We need to prove that $G$ is abelian.
We can prove this by induction on $n$.
Base case: n=0, |G| = 1, the group is trivial and abelian.
Base case: n=1, |G| = 2, the group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, which is abelian.
Base case: n=2, |G| = 4. There are two groups of order 4, $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, both are abelian.

Assume that for any group of order $2^k$ (where $k < n$) with property P is abelian.
Consider a group $G$ of order $2^n$ with property P.
The center of $G$, $Z(G) = \{z \in G | zg = gz \text{ for all } g \in G\}$.
We know that $|Z(G)|$ must be a power of 2, and $|Z(G)| > 1$ if $|G| > 1$.
Let $a \in Z(G)$. Then for any $b \in G$, $ab = ba$.
Consider the quotient group $G/Z(G)$. The order of $G/Z(G)$ is $|G|/|Z(G)| = 2^n/2^k = 2^{n-k}$ for some $k \ge 1$.
If $G/Z(G)$ is trivial, then $G = Z(G)$, so $G$ is abelian.
Assume $G/Z(G)$ is not trivial.
Consider $\bar{a}, \bar{b} \in G/Z(G)$ such that $\bar{a}^2 \bar{b} = \bar{b} \bar{a}^2$.
This means $a^2b Z(G) = ba^2 Z(G)$.
So $a^2b = ba^2 z$ for some $z \in Z(G)$.
We know $az = za$.
We have $a^2b = ba^2$. By property P, $ab = ba$.
This means $\bar{a}\bar{b} = \bar{b}\bar{a}$.
So $G/Z(G)$ also has property P.
By the induction hypothesis, $G/Z(G)$ is abelian.
This means for any $x, y \in G$, $xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \in Z(G)$.
Let $x, y \in G$. Consider $(xy)^2 = xyxy$ and $x^2y^2$.
We know that if $G/Z(G)$ is abelian, then for any $x, y \in G$, $xyZ(G) = yxZ(G)$, so $xy = yxz$ for some $z \in Z(G)$.
Consider the case where there exists an element $a$ of order 2 in $G$.
If $a^2b = ba^2$, then $1b = b1$, which gives $b=b$. This doesn't help.

Let's consider the case when $G$ is not abelian.
Then there exist $a, b \in G$ such that $ab \ne ba$.
By property P, $a^2b \ne ba^2$.

Consider the map $\phi_a: G \to G$ such that $\phi_a(x) = axa^{-1}$.
If $a^2b = ba^2$, then $b = a^{-2}ba^2$.
Consider the inner automorphism induced by $a^2$.
If $G$ is a 2-group, every non-identity element has order $2^k$.
If there is an element $a$ of order 2, then $a^2=e$. Then $eb=be$, so $b=b$.

Let $a \in G$. Consider the subgroup generated by $a$, $\langle a \rangle$.
Consider the centralizer of $a^2$, $C_G(a^2) = \{g \in G | ga^2 = a^2g\}$.
If $b \in C_G(a^2)$, then $a^2b = ba^2$, which implies $ab=ba$.
So $C_G(a^2) \subseteq C_G(a)$.

Consider the structure of a non-abelian group of order $2^n$.
If $|G|=8$, we have $D_4$ and $Q_8$.
In $D_4 = \langle r, s | r^4=s^2=e, srs=r^{-1} \rangle$.
Let $a=r, b=s$. $a^2 = r^2$. $a^2b = r^2s$. $ba^2 = sr^2$.
$r^2s = sr^2 \implies r^2s = sr^{-2} = sr^2$. So $a^2b = ba^2$.
Then by property P, $ab=ba$, so $rs=sr$. But $rs \ne sr$. So $D_4$ does not have property P.

In $Q_8 = \{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}$. $i^2=j^2=k^2=-1$, $ij=k, ji=-k$.
Let $a=i, b=j$. $a^2 = i^2 = -1$. $a^2b = -1j = -j$. $ba^2 = j(-1) = -j$.
$a^2b = ba^2$. By property P, $ab=ba$. But $ij=k, ji=-k$, so $ab \ne ba$.
So $Q_8$ does not have property P.

Let $G$ be a group of order $2^n$. Assume $G$ is not abelian.
There exists $a \in G$ such that $a \ne e$. The order of $a$ is $2^k$.
Consider the smallest non-abelian group with order $2^n$.
If $|G|=2^n$, the center $Z(G)$ is non-trivial.
Consider the case when $|G/Z(G)|=2$. Then $G/Z(G) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$.
Then for any $x, y \in G$, $xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \in Z(G)$.
Also, $G'$ is a subgroup of $Z(G)$, so $G'$ is abelian.

Let $a \in G$. The order of $a$ is $2^k$.
If for all $a, b \in G$, $a^2b = ba^2 \implies ab=ba$.
Suppose $G$ is a 2-group that is not abelian.
Then there exist $a, b$ such that $ab \ne ba$.
By the property P, $a^2b \ne ba^2$.

Let $f: G \to G$ be $f(x) = x^2$.
If $G$ is abelian, then $(ab)^2 = a^2b^2$.
If $a^2b = ba^2$, this doesn't imply $G$ is abelian.

Consider a minimal counterexample. Let $G$ be a non-abelian group of order $2^n$ with property P.
Then every group of order $2^k$ with $k<n$ has the property that if $a^2b=ba^2$ then $ab=ba$, and is abelian.
The center $Z(G)$ is non-trivial.
The group $G/Z(G)$ has order $2^m$ with $m<n$.
Consider $\bar{a}, \bar{b} \in G/Z(G)$ such that $\bar{a}^2 \bar{b} = \bar{b} \bar{a}^2$.
Then $a^2b z_1 = ba^2 z_2$ for some $z_1, z_2 \in Z(G)$.
$a^2b (z_2^{-1} z_1) = ba^2$.
Let $z = z_2^{-1} z_1 \in Z(G)$. $a^2bz = ba^2$.
Since $z \in Z(G)$, $a^2bz = a^2zb$.
So $a^2zb = ba^2$.
If $G/Z(G)$ has property P, then $\bar{a}\bar{b} = \bar{b}\bar{a}$.

Assume that groups of order less than $|G|$ with property P are abelian.
Consider $C_G(a)$, the centralizer of $a$. This is a subgroup of $G$.
If $C_G(a) \ne G$, then $|C_G(a)| = 2^k < 2^n$.
If $b \in C_G(a)$, then $ab=ba$. Also $a^2b=ba^2$.
If $b \in G$ such that $a^2b=ba^2$, then by property P, $ab=ba$, so $b \in C_G(a)$.
So $C_G(a^2) = C_G(a)$.

If $G$ is a 2-group, then for any $a \in G$, the order of $a$ is $2^k$.
If the order of $a$ is 2, $a^2=e$. Then $eb=be$, so $b=b$.

Consider the map $\phi: G \to G$ given by $\phi(x) = x^2$.
If $\phi$ is a homomorphism, $G$ is abelian.
$\phi(xy) = (xy)^2$, $\phi(x)\phi(y) = x^2y^2$.
$(xy)^2 = x^2y^2 \iff xyxy = xxyy \iff yx = xy$.

Let $a \in G$. If the order of $a$ is $> 2$, then $a^2 \ne e$.
We know $C_G(a) = C_G(a^2)$.
Consider the class equation: $|G| = |Z(G)| + \sum [G:C_G(a_i)]$.
Since $|G|$ is a power of 2, each term in the sum is a power of 2.
$[G:C_G(a_i)] = |G|/|C_G(a_i)|$.
If $a \notin Z(G)$, then $C_G(a) \ne G$, so $|C_G(a)| = 2^k$ with $k < n$.
$C_G(a)$ is a group of order $2^k$ with property P, so $C_G(a)$ is abelian.

ii) We need to find a non-abelian group such that if $a^2b = ba^2$, then $ab = ba$.

Consider the group of upper triangular matrices over $\mathbb{Z}_2$.
$ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} $
This group is abelian.

Consider the quaternion group $Q_8 = \{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}$.
Let $a=i, b=j$. $a^2 = -1$. $a^2b = -j$. $ba^2 = j(-1) = -j$.
$a^2b = ba^2$, but $ab = k \ne -k = ba$.
So $Q_8$ does not have the property.

Consider the dihedral group $D_n$.
$D_3 = \{e, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2\}$. $r^3=e, s^2=e, srs=r^{-1}$.
Let $a=r, b=s$. $a^2=r^2$. $a^2b = r^2s$. $ba^2 = sr^2$.
$r^2s = sr^4 = sr$. $r^2s \ne sr$. So $a^2b \ne ba^2$.
Let $a=s, b=r$. $a^2=e$. $a^2b = er = r$. $ba^2 = re = r$.
$a^2b = ba^2$. Then $ab = ba$, $sr = rs = r^{-1}s = r^2s$.
$r = r^2$, so $r=e$. Contradiction.

Consider a non-abelian group where the square of every element is in the center.
Let $a^2b = ba^2$. If $a^2 \in Z(G)$, then $a^2b = ba^2$ is always true.
We need $ab=ba$.
Consider a group where $x^2=e$ for all $x \in G$. Then $G$ is abelian.

Let $G$ be a non-abelian group such that if $a^2b=ba^2$, then $ab=ba$.
This means if $ab \ne ba$, then $a^2b \ne ba^2$.

Consider the symmetric group $S_3$.
Let $a=(12), b=(13)$. $a^2 = e$. $a^2b = b = (13)$. $ba^2 = b = (13)$.
$a^2b = ba^2$. Then $ab = (12)(13) = (132)$. $ba = (13)(12) = (123)$.
$ab \ne ba$. So $S_3$ does not have the property.

Consider a group where the map $x \mapsto x^2$ is injective.
If $a^2b = ba^2$, then $(ab)^2 = abab$, $(ba)^2 = baba$.
If $G$ is a non-abelian group and the map $x \mapsto x^2$ is injective.
If $a^2b=ba^2$, then $ab=ba$.
Suppose $ab \ne ba$. Then $a^2b \ne ba^2$.

Consider the group of integers under addition. This is abelian.
$2a+b = b+2a$. This always holds. $a+b = b+a$.

Consider a non-abelian group where the order of every element is odd.
If $a^2b=ba^2$, then $ab=ba$.
Let the order of $a$ be $n$, where $n$ is odd.
Then there exists an integer $k$ such that $2k \equiv 1 \pmod n$.
$a^{2k} = a^1 = a$.
$a^2b = ba^2 \implies (a^2)^kb = b(a^2)^k \implies ab = ba$.
So any non-abelian group where the order of every element is odd is an example.
Example: $A_5$, the alternating group of degree 5. The order is 60.
The elements have orders 1, 2, 3, 5.
$A_5$ is non-abelian.
If $a^2b = ba^2$, then $ab=ba$.

Let $G=S_3$. Let $a=(123)$, $b=(12)$.
$a^2 = (132)$. $a^2b = (132)(12) = (23)$.
$ba^2 = (12)(132) = (13)$.
$a^2b \ne ba^2$.
$ab = (123)(12) = (13)$.
$ba = (12)(123) = (23)$.
$ab \ne ba$.

Consider a finite group where every element has odd order.
If $a^2b = ba^2$, multiply by $a^{-1}$ on the left and right.
$a^{-1}a^2ba^{-1} = a^{-1}ba^2a^{-1}$
$aba^{-1} = a^{-1}ba$.

If $G$ is a 2-group and $a^2b=ba^2 \implies ab=ba$.
Suppose $ab \ne ba$. Then $a^2b \ne ba^2$.

Consider the generalized quaternion group $Q_{2^n}$ for $n \ge 3$.
$Q_{2^n} = \langle x, y | x^{2^{n-1}}=1, y^2=x^{2^{n-2}}, yxy^{-1}=x^{-1} \rangle$.
$|Q_{2^n}| = 2^n$.
Let $a=x, b=y$.
$a^2 = x^2$. $a^2b = x^2y$. $ba^2 = yx^2$.
$yx^2 = (yxy^{-1})(yxy^{-1})y = x^{-1}x^{-1}y = x^{-2}y$.
$x^2y = yx^2 \implies x^2y = x^{-2}y \implies x^2 = x^{-2} \implies x^4 = 1$.
The order of $x$ is $2^{n-1}$.
If $n-1 \ge 3$, then $2^{n-1} \ge 8$, so $x^4=1$ is not always true.
If $n=3$, $Q_8$. Order of $x$ is 4. $x^4=1$.
So for $Q_8$, $a^2b = ba^2$. But $ab \ne ba$.

Final check of part i).
Let $G$ be a 2-group with property P.
Suppose $G$ is not abelian. Then there exists a minimal non-abelian 2-group with property P.
All proper subgroups and quotients by non-trivial normal subgroups with property P are abelian.
Consider $G/Z(G)$. It has property P and order $2^k < |G|$. So $G/Z(G)$ is abelian.
So $x^{-1}y^{-1}xy \in Z(G)$ for all $x, y \in G$.
Consider the map $\phi: G \to G$, $\phi(g) = g^2$.
If $\phi$ is a homomorphism, $G$ is abelian.

Example for ii).
Consider a non-abelian group where every element has odd order.
If $a^2b = ba^2$, then multiply by $a^{-1}$ appropriately.
Let $o(a) = 2k+1$. Then $a^{2k+1} = e$. $a^{2k} = a^{-1}$.
$a^2b = ba^2 \implies a^{-1}(a^2b)a^{-1} = a^{-1}(ba^2)a^{-1}$
$ba^{-1} = a^{-1}b$.
$ab = ba$.
Example: $S_3$ has elements of order 2 and 3.
Example: $A_5$. Order 60. Elements of order 1, 2, 3, 5.
