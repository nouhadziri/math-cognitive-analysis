Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
### Part (a)
1. Let \( x \) be a nilpotent element in \( A \). By definition, there exists some positive integer \( k \) such that \( x^k = 0 \) and \( x^{k-1} \neq 0 \).
2. Consider the element \( 1 + x^{k-1} \). We need to show that \( (1 + x^{k-1})^n = 1 \).
3. Using the binomial theorem in the context of a ring, we have:
   \[
   (1 + x^{k-1})^n = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \binom{n}{i} (1)^{n-i} (x^{k-1})^i
   \]
4. Since \( x^k = 0 \), for \( i \geq 2 \), \( (x^{k-1})^i = x^{i(k-1)} = 0 \). Therefore, the sum reduces to:
   \[
   (1 + x^{k-1})^n = 1 + \binom{n}{1} x^{k-1} = 1 + n x^{k-1}
   \]
5. Given that \( (1 + x^{k-1})^n = 1 \), we have:
   \[
   1 + n x^{k-1} = 1
   \]
6. This implies \( n x^{k-1} = 0 \). Since \( A \) is a finite ring with \( n \) elements, \( n \) is the characteristic of the ring, meaning \( n \cdot a = 0 \) for all \( a \in A \). Thus, \( x^{k-1} = 0 \).
7. This contradicts the assumption that \( x^{k-1} \neq 0 \). Therefore, the only nilpotent element in \( A \) must be \( 0 \).

\(\blacksquare\)

### Part (b)
1. Consider the set \( A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\} \) and the \( n^{n} + 1 \) \( n \)-tuples \( (a_1^k, a_2^k, \ldots, a_n^k) \) for \( 1 \leq k \leq n^n + 1 \).
2. By the pigeonhole principle, since there are only \( n^n \) distinct \( n \)-tuples possible, there must be at least two \( n \)-tuples that are identical. Let these tuples correspond to \( k = i \) and \( k = j \) with \( i > j \).
3. Choose \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( j \) is minimal. Then we have:
   \[
   (a_1^i, a_2^i, \ldots, a_n^i) = (a_1^j, a_2^j, \ldots, a_n^j)
   \]
4. This implies \( a_m^i = a_m^j \) for all \( m \). Therefore, \( a_m^{i-j} = a_m \) for all \( m \).
5. Let \( k = i - j \). Then \( k \geq 1 \) and \( a_m^k = a_m \) for all \( m \).
6. Since \( A \) has \( n \) elements, the equation \( x^k = x \) has \( n \) solutions in \( A \).
