Problem:
A hexagon inscribed in a circle has three consecutive sides, each of length 3, and three consecutive sides, each of length 5. The chord of the circle that divides the hexagon into two trapezoids, one with three sides, each of length 3, and the other with three sides, each of length 5, has length equal to $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
In hexagon $ABCDEF$, let $AB=BC=CD=3$ and let $DE=EF=FA=5$. Since arc $BAF$ is one third of the circumference of the circle, it follows that $\angle BCF = \angle BEF=60^{\circ}$. Similarly, $\angle CBE =\angle CFE=60^{\circ}$. Let $P$ be the intersection of $\overline{BE}$ and $\overline{CF}$, $Q$ that of $\overline{BE}$ and $\overline{AD}$, and $R$ that of $\overline{CF}$ and $\overline{AD}$. Triangles $EFP$ and  $BCP$ are equilateral, and by symmetry, triangle $PQR$ is isosceles and thus also equilateral.  [asy]
import olympiad; import geometry; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));
real angleUnit = 15;
draw(Circle(origin,1));
pair D = dir(22.5);
pair C = dir(3*angleUnit + degrees(D));
pair B = dir(3*angleUnit + degrees(C));
pair A = dir(3*angleUnit + degrees(B));
pair F = dir(5*angleUnit + degrees(A));
pair E = dir(5*angleUnit + degrees(F));
draw(A--B--C--D--E--F--cycle);

[/asy]

Furthermore, $\angle BAD$ and $\angle BED$ subtend the same arc, as do $\angle ABE$ and $\angle ADE$. Hence triangles $ABQ$ and $EDQ$ are similar. Therefore, $$\frac{AQ}{EQ}=\frac{BQ}{DQ}=\frac{AB}{ED}=\frac{3}{5}.$$ It follows that $$\frac{\frac{AD-PQ}{2}}{PQ+5} =\frac{3}{5}\quad
\mbox {and}\quad \frac{3-PQ}{\frac{AD+PQ}{2}}=\frac{3}{5}.$$ Solving the two equations simultaneously  yields $AD=360/49,$ so $m+n=\boxed{409}$.
