Problem:
Let  $n \geq 4$  be an even natural number and  $G$  be a subgroup of  $GL_2(\mathbb{C})$  with  $|G| = n.$  Prove that there exists  $H \leq G$  such that  $\{ I_2 \} \neq H$  and  $H \neq G$  such that  $XYX^{-1} \in H, \: \forall X \in G$  and  $\forall Y \in H$ 

Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Initial Assumptions and Goal**: 
   Let \( n \geq 4 \) be an even natural number and \( G \) be a subgroup of \( GL_2(\mathbb{C}) \) with \( |G| = n \). We need to prove that there exists a subgroup \( H \leq G \) such that \( \{ I_2 \} \neq H \) and \( H \neq G \), and \( XYX^{-1} \in H \) for all \( X \in G \) and \( Y \in H \). This means \( H \) is a non-trivial normal subgroup of \( G \).

2. **Case 1: \( G \) is Abelian**:
   - If \( G \) is abelian, then every subgroup of \( G \) is normal.
   - Since \( n \geq 4 \), \( G \) has an element \( Y \) of order 2 (by Cauchy's theorem for abelian groups).
   - Let \( H = \langle Y \rangle \). Clearly, \( H \neq \{ I_2 \} \) and \( H \neq G \) because \( |G| > 2 \).
   - Since \( G \) is abelian, \( H \) is normal in \( G \).

3. **Case 2: \( G \) is Non-Abelian**:
   - Suppose \( G \) is non-abelian and has no non-trivial normal subgroup.
   - Consider the group homomorphism \( f: G \to \mathbb{C}^{\times} \) defined by \( f(X) = \det(X) \).
   - The kernel of \( f \), \( \ker f \), is a normal subgroup of \( G \). Since \( G \) has no non-trivial normal subgroup, \( \ker f \) must be either \( \{I_2\} \) or \( G \).

4. **Analyzing \( \ker f \)**:
   - If \( \ker f = \{I_2\} \), then \( G \) is isomorphic to a subgroup of \( \mathbb{C}^{\times} \), which is abelian. This contradicts our assumption that \( G \) is non-abelian.
   - Therefore, \( \ker f = G \), implying \( \det(X) = 1 \) for all \( X \in G \). Thus, \( G \) is a subgroup of \( SL_2(\mathbb{C}) \).

5. **Existence of an Element of Order 2**:
   - Since \( n \) is even, by Cauchy's theorem, \( G \) has an element \( Y \) of order 2.
   - For \( Y \in G \) with \( Y^2 = I_2 \), \( Y \) is diagonalizable. Thus, \( Y = P \begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & b \end{pmatrix} P^{-1} \) for some \( P \in GL_2(\mathbb{C}) \).

6. **Eigenvalues of \( Y \)**:
   - Since \( Y^2 = I_2 \), the eigenvalues \( a \) and \( b \) of \( Y \) must be \( \pm 1 \).
   - Given \( \det(Y) = 1 \), the product of the eigenvalues \( ab = 1 \). The possible pairs \((a, b)\) are \((1, 1)\) or \((-1, -1)\).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - If \( a = b = 1 \), then \( Y = I_2 \), which contradicts \( Y \) having order 2.
   - Therefore, \( a = b = -1 \), and \( Y = -I_2 \).
   - The subgroup \( H = \langle Y \rangle = \{ I_2, -I_2 \} \) is a non-trivial normal subgroup of \( G \) because \( -I_2 \) is a central element of \( G \).

Thus, we have shown that \( G \) must have a non-trivial normal subgroup \( H \).

<text>**Case 1: \( G \) is Abelian**:
   - If \( G \) is abelian, then every subgroup of \( G \) is normal.

<text>**Case 2: \( G \) is Non-Abelian**:
   - Suppose \( G \) is non-abelian and has no non-trivial normal subgroup.
   - Consider the group homomorphism \( f: G \to \mathbb{C}^{\times} \) defined by \( f(X) = \det(X) \).
   - The kernel of \( f \), \( \ker f \), is a normal subgroup of \( G \). Since \( G \) has no non-trivial normal subgroup, \( \ker f \) must be either \( \{I_2\} \) or \( G \).</text>
<explanation>The solver continues with the second case, setting up a proof by contradiction approach. This demonstrates planning by anticipating that this case will require a different strategy and organizing the solution accordingly.</explanation>

<text>Since \( n \geq 4 \), \( G \) has an element \( Y \) of order 2 (by Cauchy's theorem for abelian groups).</text>
<explanation>The solver correctly applies Cauchy's theorem, which states that if p is a prime dividing the order of a finite abelian group, then the group contains an element of order p. Here, since n is even, 2 divides n, so there exists an element of order 2.</explanation>

<end>720</end>
<text>The kernel of \( f \), \( \ker f \), is a normal subgroup of \( G \). Since \( G \) has no non-trivial normal subgroup, \( \ker f \) must be either \( \{I_2\} \) or \( G \).</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the fundamental theorem that the kernel of a group homomorphism is always a normal subgroup, and then uses the assumption to deduce that this kernel must be trivial or the entire group.</explanation>

<text>**Analyzing \( \ker f \)**:
   - If \( \ker f = \{I_2\} \), then \( G \) is isomorphic to a subgroup of \( \mathbb{C}^{\times} \), which is abelian. This contradicts our assumption that \( G \) is non-abelian.
   - Therefore, \( \ker f = G \), implying \( \det(X) = 1 \) for all \( X \in G \). Thus, \( G \) is a subgroup of \( SL_2(\mathbb{C}) \).</text>
<explanation>The solver uses logical reasoning to analyze the consequences of each possibility for the kernel. They identify a contradiction in the first case (if the kernel is trivial, G would be abelian, contradicting the assumption), and then deduce the logical conclusion for the second case (G must be a subgroup of SL₂(ℂ)).</explanation>

<start>968</start>
<end>1158</end>
<text>**Existence of an Element of Order 2**:
   - Since \( n \) is even, by Cauchy's theorem, \( G \) has an element \( Y \) of order 2.
   - For \( Y \in G \) with \( Y^2 = I_2 \), \( Y \) is diagonalizable. Thus, \( Y = P \begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & b \end{pmatrix} P^{-1} \) for some \( P \in GL_2(\mathbb{C}) \).</text>
<explanation>The solver makes a logical inference about the existence of an element of order 2 using Cauchy's theorem, and then deduces that such an element must be diagonalizable in GL₂(ℂ), showing a chain of logical reasoning.</explanation>

<end>1394</end>
<text>The possible pairs \((a, b)\) are \((1, 1)\) or \((-1, -1)\).</text>
<explanation>The solver logically deduces the only possible eigenvalue pairs that satisfy both Y² = I₂ and det(Y) = 1, demonstrating precise logical reasoning.</explanation>

<start>1395</start>
<end>1626</end>
<text>**Conclusion**:
   - If \( a = b = 1 \), then \( Y = I_2 \), which contradicts \( Y \) having order 2.

   - The subgroup \( H = \langle Y \rangle = \{ I_2, -I_2 \} \) is a non-trivial normal subgroup of \( G \) because \( -I_2 \) is a central element of \( G \).</text>
<explanation>The solver completes the logical argument by eliminating one possibility (a=b=1) through contradiction, and then concluding that Y must be -I₂. They then identify the appropriate subgroup H and verify that it satisfies all the required properties.</explanation>

<text>**Analyzing \( \ker f \)**:
