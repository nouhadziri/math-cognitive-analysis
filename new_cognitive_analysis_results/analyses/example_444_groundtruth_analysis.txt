Problem:
Consider the fission of $^{236}U$ into two equal mass prompt fission fragments and zero free neutrons. What is the value of proton number Z giving the most stable nucleus with the same mass number? What is the energy released by each fragment to reach that stable nucleus by a series of beta decay?

Answer Choices:
(A) Z=51, Energy= 20 MeV
(B) Z=47, Energy=5 MeV
(C) Z=50, Energy= 18 MeV
(D) Z=48, Energy= 16MeV

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Minimizing the semi-empirical mass formula for the binding energy, for the fixed value of A=118, with respect to Z one obtains the expression for the minimum point of the stability line. Putting in the values of the  parameters (any set from available text books) will lead to $Z_{min} = ~50$. The corresponding energy release can be obtained using the mass energy equivalence $\Delta mc^2 = (m(Z=46,A=118) - m(Z=50,A=118) )c^2$. Mass of the nuclei can also be obtained from the semi-empirical mass formula.
