1. $ 

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for all positive integers $n$ such that there exist three roots of unity of order $n$, say $\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3$, satisfying $\omega_1 + \omega_2 + \omega_3 = 1$.
The roots of unity of order $n$ are given by $e^{2\pi i k / n}$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1$.

Let $\omega_1 = e^{2\pi i a / n}$, $\omega_2 = e^{2\pi i b / n}$, $\omega_3 = e^{2\pi i c / n}$, where $a, b, c \in \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$.
We have the equation $e^{2\pi i a / n} + e^{2\pi i b / n} + e^{2\pi i c / n} = 1$.

Consider the case where $n=1$. The only root of unity is $e^{0} = 1$. If we take $\omega_1 = \omega_2 = \omega_3 = 1$, then $\omega_1 + \omega_2 + \omega_3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \neq 1$. So $n=1$ is not a solution.

Consider the case where $n=2$. The roots of unity are $1, -1$.
Possible sums of three roots of unity:
$1 + 1 + 1 = 3$
$1 + 1 + (-1) = 1$
$1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1$
$(-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -3$
We found a sum equal to 1, so $n=2$ is a solution. The roots are $1, 1, -1$.

Consider the case where $n=3$. The roots of unity are $1, e^{2\pi i / 3}, e^{4\pi i / 3}$. Let $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3}$. The roots are $1, \omega, \omega^2$.
Possible sums:
$1 + 1 + 1 = 3$
$1 + 1 + \omega = 2 + \omega = 2 - 1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2 = 3/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2$
$1 + 1 + \omega^2 = 2 + \omega^2 = 2 - 1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2 = 3/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2$
$1 + \omega + \omega = 1 + 2\omega = 1 + 2(-1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2) = 1 - 1 + i \sqrt{3} = i \sqrt{3}$
$1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0$
$\omega + \omega + \omega = 3\omega$
$\omega + \omega + \omega^2 = 2\omega + \omega^2 = 2(-1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2) + (-1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2) = -1 + i \sqrt{3} - 1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2 = -3/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2$
$\omega + \omega^2 + \omega^2 = \omega + 2\omega^2 = (-1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2) + 2(-1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2) = -1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2 - 1 - i \sqrt{3} = -3/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2$
$\omega^2 + \omega^2 + \omega^2 = 3\omega^2$
None of these sums is equal to 1. So $n=3$ is not a solution.

Consider the case where $n=4$. The roots of unity are $1, i, -1, -i$.
Possible sums:
$1 + 1 + (-1) = 1$  (Found a solution: $n=4$)
The roots are $1, 1, -1$.

Geometric interpretation: We are looking for three vectors from the origin to points on the unit circle, such that their vector sum is the vector from the origin to $1$ on the real axis.

If $\omega_1 + \omega_2 + \omega_3 = 1$, then $|\omega_1 + \omega_2 + \omega_3| = |1| = 1$.

Consider the case where two of the roots are equal, say $\omega_1 = \omega_2 = \omega$.
Then $2\omega + \omega_3 = 1$, so $\omega_3 = 1 - 2\omega$.
We have $|\omega_3| = |1 - 2\omega| = 1$.
$|1 - 2\omega|^2 = (1 - 2\omega)(1 - 2\bar{\omega}) = 1 - 2\omega - 2\bar{\omega} + 4\omega\bar{\omega} = 1 - 2(\omega + \bar{\omega}) + 4|\omega|^2 = 1 - 2(2 \text{Re}(\omega)) + 4(1) = 5 - 4 \text{Re}(\omega)$.
So $5 - 4 \text{Re}(\omega) = 1$, which implies $4 \text{Re}(\omega) = 4$, so $\text{Re}(\omega) = 1$.
Since $|\omega| = 1$, $\omega = 1$.
If $\omega = 1$, then $\omega_3 = 1 - 2(1) = -1$.
The roots are $1, 1, -1$. These are roots of unity of order $n$ if $n$ is a multiple of 2.

Consider the case where $\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3$ are distinct.
If the three roots are $1, \omega, \omega^2$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3}$, then $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0 \neq 1$.

Let the angles be $\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3$, where $\theta_k = 2\pi a_k / n$.
$e^{i \theta_1} + e^{i \theta_2} + e^{i \theta_3} = 1$
$(\cos \theta_1 + \cos \theta_2 + \cos \theta_3) + i (\sin \theta_1 + \sin \theta_2 + \sin \theta_3) = 1$
$\cos \theta_1 + \cos \theta_2 + \cos \theta_3 = 1$
$\sin \theta_1 + \sin \theta_2 + \sin \theta_3 = 0$

Consider the case $n=5$. Roots are $1, \zeta, \zeta^2, \zeta^3, \zeta^4$, where $\zeta = e^{2\pi i / 5}$.
Sum of all roots is 0.
Consider three consecutive roots: $1 + \zeta + \zeta^2$.
Consider the regular pentagon on the complex plane with vertices at the roots of unity.

Consider the geometric interpretation again. We are adding three unit vectors and the result is a vector of length 1 along the real axis. This means the three vectors must form a shape such that their sum points to 1.

If the three roots are $1, e^{i \alpha}, e^{-i \alpha}$, then $1 + \cos \alpha + i \sin \alpha + \cos(-\alpha) + i \sin(-\alpha) = 1 + 2 \cos \alpha$.
We need $1 + 2 \cos \alpha = 1$, so $\cos \alpha = 0$, $\alpha = \pi/2$ or $3\pi/2$.
If $\alpha = \pi/2$, the roots are $1, i, -i$. Sum is $1$.
These are roots of unity of order $n$ if $n$ is a multiple of 4.

If the three roots are $1, e^{i \alpha}, e^{i \beta}$.
$1 + \cos \alpha + i \sin \alpha + \cos \beta + i \sin \beta = 1$
$1 + \cos \alpha + \cos \beta = 1 \implies \cos \alpha + \cos \beta = 0$
$\sin \alpha + \sin \beta = 0$

From $\sin \alpha + \sin \beta = 0$, we have $\sin \alpha = -\sin \beta = \sin(-\beta)$.
So $\alpha = -\beta + 2k\pi$ or $\alpha = \pi - (-\beta) + 2k\pi = \pi + \beta + 2k\pi$.

Case 1: $\alpha = -\beta + 2k\pi$. Then $\cos \alpha = \cos(-\beta) = \cos \beta$.
$\cos \alpha + \cos \beta = 2 \cos \alpha = 0$, so $\cos \alpha = 0$.
$\alpha = \pi/2 + m\pi$.
If $\alpha = \pi/2$, then $\beta = -\pi/2 + 2k\pi$.
If $\alpha = 3\pi/2$, then $\beta = -\3\pi/2 + 2k\pi = \pi/2 + 2(k-1)\pi$.
So $\{\alpha, \beta\} = \{\pi/2, -\pi/2\}$ or $\{\pi/2, 3\pi/2\}$.

If angles are $0, \pi/2, -\pi/2$, roots are $1, i, -i$. Sum is 1. Order $n$ multiple of 4.
If angles are $0, \pi/2, 3\pi/2$, roots are $1, i, -i$. Sum is 1.

Case 2: $\alpha = \pi + \beta + 2k\pi$.
$\cos \alpha = \cos(\pi + \beta) = -\cos \beta$.
$\cos \alpha + \cos \beta = -\cos \beta + \cos \beta = 0$. This is always true.
The angles are $0, \theta, \pi + \theta$.
The roots are $1, e^{i \theta}, e^{i (\pi + \theta)} = -e^{i \theta}$.
Sum is $1 + e^{i \theta} - e^{i \theta} = 1$.
The roots are $1, \omega, -\omega$, where $\omega$ is a root of unity of order $n$.
We need $\omega^n = 1$ and $(-\omega)^n = 1$.
If $n$ is even, $(-\omega)^n = \omega^n = 1$.
If $n$ is odd, $(-\omega)^n = -\omega^n = -1 \neq 1$.
So $n$ must be even.

Consider the roots $1, e^{2\pi i k / n}, -e^{2\pi i k / n}$.
These are roots of unity of order $n$.
$1$ is always a root of unity.
$e^{2\pi i k / n}$ is a root of unity of order $n$.
$-e^{2\pi i k / n} = e^{i \pi} e^{2\pi i k / n} = e^{i (\pi + 2\pi k / n)} = e^{i \pi (1 + 2k/n)}$.
We need $\pi (1 + 2k/n) = 2\pi m / n$ for some integer $m$.
$1 + 2k/n = 2m / n$
$n + 2k = 2m$
$n = 2(m - k)$.
So $n$ must be even.

Summary so far:
If the three roots are $1, 1, -1$, then $n$ is a multiple of 2.
If the three roots are $1, i, -i$, then $n$ is a multiple of 4.
If the three roots are $1, \omega, -\omega$, then $n$ is even.

Let's formalize the cases.

Case 1: The three roots are $1, e^{i \alpha}, e^{-i \alpha}$.
These are roots of unity of order $n$.
$e^{i \alpha} = e^{2\pi i k / n}$ for some $k$.
$\alpha = 2\pi k / n$.
We need $e^{i (-\alpha)}$ to be a root of unity of order $n$.
$e^{-2\pi i k / n} = e^{2\pi i (n-k) / n}$.

The sum is $1 + e^{i \alpha} + e^{-i \alpha} = 1 + 2 \cos \alpha = 1$.
$2 \cos \alpha = 0$, so $\alpha = \pi/2 + m\pi$.

If $\alpha = \pi/2$, then $2\pi k / n = \pi/2$, $4k = n$. So $n$ is a multiple of 4.
Roots are $1, i, -i$.

If $\alpha = 3\pi/2$, then $2\pi k / n = 3\pi/2$, $4k = 3n$.
Since $k < n$, $4k < 4n$, so $3n < 4n$, which is true.
We need $n$ to be a multiple of 4 for the roots to be of order $n$.
If $n=4$, $\alpha = 3\pi/2$, roots are $1, e^{3\pi i / 2} = -i, e^{-3\pi i / 2} = i$.

Case 2: The three roots are $1, \omega, -\omega$.
$\omega = e^{2\pi i k / n}$.
$-\omega = -e^{2\pi i k / n} = e^{i \pi} e^{2\pi i k / n} = e^{i (\pi + 2\pi k / n)}$.
We need $\pi + 2\pi k / n = 2\pi m / n$ for some integer $m$.
$n + 2k = 2m$, so $n = 2(m - k)$.
This means $n$ is even.

If $n$ is even, let $n = 2p$.
Consider roots $1, e^{2\pi i / n}, -e^{2\pi i / n}$.
$-e^{2\pi i / n} = e^{i \pi} e^{2\pi i / n} = e^{i (\pi + 2\pi / n)} = e^{i \pi (1 + 2/n)} = e^{i \pi (1 + 1/p)}$.
We need $\pi (1 + 1/p) = 2\pi m / (2p) = \pi m / p$.
$1 + 1/p = m / p$, so $p + 1 = m$. Integer $m$ exists.
So if $n$ is even, we can find a root $\omega$ such that $-\omega$ is also a root of order $n$.

If $n$ is a multiple of 2, consider roots $1, 1, -1$. These are roots of order $n$. Sum is 1.

Let's consider the equation $\omega_1 + \omega_2 + \omega_3 = 1$ again.
Divide by $\omega_3$: $\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_3} + \frac{\omega_2}{\omega_3} + 1 = \frac{1}{\omega_3} = \bar{\omega}_3$.
Let $z_1 = \omega_1 \bar{\omega}_3$, $z_2 = \omega_2 \bar{\omega}_3$. These are roots of unity of order $n$.
$z_1 + z_2 + 1 = \bar{\omega}_3$.
$z_1 + z_2 = \bar{\omega}_3 - 1$.

$|z_1 + z_2|^2 = |\bar{\omega}_3 - 1|^2 = |\omega_3 - 1|^2$.
$(z_1 + z_2)(\bar{z}_1 + \bar{z}_2) = (\omega_3 - 1)(\bar{\omega}_3 - 1)$
$|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 + z_1 \bar{z}_2 + \bar{z}_1 z_2 = |\omega_3|^2 + 1 - \omega_3 - \bar{\omega}_3$
$1 + 1 + 2 \text{Re}(z_1 \bar{z}_2) = 1 + 1 - 2 \text{Re}(\omega_3)$
$2 + 2 \text{Re}(z_1 \bar{z}_2) = 2 - 2 \text{Re}(\omega_3)$
$\text{Re}(z_1 \bar{z}_2) = - \text{Re}(\omega_3)$.

Let $z_1 = e^{i \alpha}$, $z_2 = e^{i \beta}$, $\omega_3 = e^{i \gamma}$.
$\text{Re}(e^{i (\alpha - \beta)}) = - \cos \gamma$.
$\cos(\alpha - \beta) = - \cos \gamma = \cos(\pi - \gamma)$.
$\alpha - \beta = \pm (\pi - \gamma) + 2k\pi$.

Case 1: $\alpha - \beta = \pi - \gamma + 2k\pi$, so $\alpha - \beta + \gamma = \pi + 2k\pi$.
Case 2: $\alpha - \beta = -\pi + \gamma + 2k\pi$, so $\alpha - \beta - \gamma = -\pi + 2k\pi$.

We have $e^{i \alpha} + e^{i \beta} = e^{-i \gamma} - 1$.
Magnitude squared: $|e^{i \alpha} + e^{i \beta}|^2 = |e^{-i \gamma} - 1|^2$.
$|e^{i \alpha}|^2 + |e^{i \beta}|^2 + 2 \text{Re}(e^{i (\alpha - \beta)}) = |e^{-i \gamma}|^2 + 1 - 2 \text{Re}(e^{-i \gamma})$.
$1 + 1 + 2 \cos(\alpha - \beta) = 1 + 1 - 2 \cos(-\gamma) = 2 - 2 \cos \gamma$.
$2 + 2 \cos(\alpha - \beta) = 2 - 2 \cos \gamma$.
$\cos(\alpha - \beta) = - \cos \gamma$. Same result.

Consider the case $n=5$.
Sum of three roots of order 5 equal to 1.
Let the roots be $e^{2\pi i a / 5}, e^{2\pi i b / 5}, e^{2\pi i c / 5}$.
Consider the regular pentagon. We need three vectors from origin to vertices summing to the vector from origin to 1.

Consider the equation $z_1 + z_2 = \bar{\omega}_3 - 1$.
This means the vector sum of $z_1$ and $z_2$ is the vector from 1 to $\bar{\omega}_3$.
The parallelogram law of vector addition.

If $n=5$, the roots are $1, \zeta, \zeta^2, \zeta^3, \zeta^4$.
Let's assume $n$ is odd, $n \ge 3$.
If $1, \omega, -\omega$ are roots, then $-\omega$ must be a root of order $n$.
$-\omega = e^{i \pi} e^{i \theta} = e^{i (\pi + \theta)}$, where $\theta = 2\pi k / n$.
$\pi + 2\pi k / n = 2\pi m / n$, so $n + 2k = 2m$, impossible if $n$ is odd.

If $n$ is a solution, then there exist integers $a, b, c$ such that
$e^{2\pi i a / n} + e^{2\pi i b / n} + e^{2\pi i c / n} = 1$.

We found solutions for $n=2$ and $n=4$.
If $n$ is a multiple of 2, say $n = 2k$, then $1, 1, -1$ are roots of order $n$.
$1 = e^{0}$, $1 = e^{2\pi i k / n}$, $-1 = e^{\pi i} = e^{n \pi i / n}$.
If $n$ is even, $n \pi$ is a multiple of $2\pi$.

If $n$ is a multiple of 4, say $n = 4k$, then $1, i, -i$ are roots of order $n$.
$1 = e^0$, $i = e^{\pi i / 2} = e^{2\pi i k / (4k)}$, $-i = e^{3\pi i / 2}$.

Consider the Eisenstein integers.

Final check:
If $n=2$, roots $1, -1$. $1 + 1 + (-1) = 1$.
If $n$ is even, $n = 2k$. Roots $1, 1, -1$. $1^n = 1, (-1)^n = 1$.
If $n=4$, roots $1, i, -i$. $1 + i + (-i) = 1$.
If $n$ is a multiple of 4, $n = 4k$. Roots $1, i, -i$.
$i^n = i^{4k} = (i^4)^k = 1^k = 1$.
$(-i)^n = (-i)^{4k} = ((-i)^4)^k = (i^4)^k = 1$.

Consider the case when $n$ is odd, $n \ge 3$.
Suppose $e^{i \theta_1} + e^{i \theta_2} + e^{i \theta_3} = 1$.
If one of the roots is 1, say $\theta_1 = 0$, then $1 + e^{i \theta_2} + e^{i \theta_3} = 1$, so $e^{i \theta_2} + e^{i \theta_3} = 0$.
$e^{i \theta_2} = - e^{i \theta_3} = e^{i (\theta_3 + \pi)}$.
$\theta_2 = \theta_3 + \pi + 2k\pi$.
$2\pi a / n = 2\pi b / n + \pi + 2k\pi$.
$2a / n = 2b / n + 1 + 2k$.
$2a = 2b + n (1 + 2k)$.
$2(a - b) = n (1 + 2k)$.
Since $n$ is odd, $n$ must divide $a - b$.
$a - b = mn$.
$2mn = n (1 + 2k)$, so $2m = 1 + 2k$, impossible since $1+2k$ is odd.
So if one root is 1, the other two must sum to 0, i.e., be opposite.
If $e^{i \theta}$ is a root of order $n$, then $\theta = 2\pi k / n$.
$-\theta = \theta + \pi \pmod{2\pi}$.
$2\pi k / n = 2\pi l / n + \pi \pmod{2\pi}$.
$2k / n = 2l / n + 1 \pmod{2}$.
$2k = 2l + n \pmod{2n}$.
$2(k-l) = n \pmod{2n}$.
Since $n$ is odd, this is impossible.

The possible values of $n$ are even integers.

$|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 + z_1 \bar{z}_2 + \bar{z}_1 z_2 = |\omega_3|^2 + 1 - \omega_3 - \bar{\omega}_3$
$1 + 1 + 2 \text{Re}(z_1 \bar{z}_2) = 1 + 1 - 2 \text{Re}(\omega_3)$
$2 + 2 \text{Re}(z_1 \bar{z}_2) = 2 - 2 \text{Re}(\omega_3)$
$\text{Re}(z_1 \bar{z}_2) = - \text{Re}(\omega_3)$.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies algebraic techniques to manipulate complex expressions, using properties of complex numbers and their magnitudes to derive a relationship between Re(z₁z̄₂) and Re(ω₃).</explanation>

<text>If $n$ is a multiple of 4, $n = 4k$. Roots $1, i, -i$.
$i^n = i^{4k} = (i^4)^k = 1^k = 1$.
$(-i)^n = (-i)^{4k} = ((-i)^4)^k = (i^4)^k = 1$.

Consider the case when $n$ is odd, $n \ge 3$.
Suppose $e^{i \theta_1} + e^{i \theta_2} + e^{i \theta_3} = 1$.
If one of the roots is 1, say $\theta_1 = 0$, then $1 + e^{i \theta_2} + e^{i \theta_3} = 1$, so $e^{i \theta_2} + e^{i \theta_3} = 0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses algebraic manipulation to verify that certain complex numbers are indeed nth roots of unity for specific values of n, and to derive constraints on the relationships between roots when their sum equals 1.</explanation>

<text>$e^{i \theta_2} = - e^{i \theta_3} = e^{i (\theta_3 + \pi)}$.
$\theta_2 = \theta_3 + \pi + 2k\pi$.
$2\pi a / n = 2\pi b / n + \pi + 2k\pi$.
$2a / n = 2b / n + 1 + 2k$.
$2a = 2b + n (1 + 2k)$.
$2(a - b) = n (1 + 2k)$.
Since $n$ is odd, $n$ must divide $a - b$.
$a - b = mn$.
$2mn = n (1 + 2k)$, so $2m = 1 + 2k$, impossible since $1+2k$ is odd.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses algebraic manipulation to derive a contradiction, showing that when n is odd, certain constraints on the roots of unity cannot be satisfied, thus eliminating odd values of n from the solution set.</explanation>

<skill>Systematic Enumeration</skill>
<definition>Methodically listing and examining all possible cases or combinations to ensure a comprehensive analysis.</definition>

<text>We have the equation $e^{2\pi i a / n} + e^{2\pi i b / n} + e^{2\pi i c / n} = 1$.

Consider the case where $n=1$. The only root of unity is $e^{0} = 1$. If we take $\omega_1 = \omega_2 = \omega_3 = 1$, then $\omega_1 + \omega_2 + \omega_3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \neq 1$. So $n=1$ is not a solution.</text>
<explanation>The solver begins a systematic examination of different values of n, starting with n=1, and methodically checks if the conditions of the problem can be satisfied.</explanation>

<text>$1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1$
$(-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -3$
We found a sum equal to 1, so $n=2$ is a solution. The roots are $1, 1, -1$.</text>
<explanation>The solver continues the systematic enumeration for n=2, listing all possible combinations of three roots and identifying that n=2 is a solution when the roots are 1, 1, and -1.</explanation>

<text>$\omega + \omega + \omega = 3\omega$
$\omega + \omega + \omega^2 = 2\omega + \omega^2 = 2(-1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2) + (-1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2) = -1 + i \sqrt{3} - 1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2 = -3/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2$
$\omega + \omega^2 + \omega^2 = \omega + 2\omega^2 = (-1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2) + 2(-1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2) = -1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2 - 1 - i \sqrt{3} = -3/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2$
$\omega^2 + \omega^2 + \omega^2 = 3\omega^2$
None of these sums is equal to 1. So $n=3$ is not a solution.</text>
<explanation>The solver completes the systematic enumeration for n=3, calculating all possible combinations of three roots and determining that none sum to 1, thus excluding n=3 as a solution.</explanation>

<skill>Proof by Contradiction</skill>
<definition>Assuming the opposite of what needs to be proven and showing that this assumption leads to a logical contradiction, thereby proving the original statement.</definition>

<text>$e^{i \theta_2} = - e^{i \theta_3} = e^{i (\theta_3 + \pi)}$.
$\theta_2 = \theta_3 + \pi + 2k\pi$.
$2\pi a / n = 2\pi b / n + \pi + 2k\pi$.
$2a / n = 2b / n + 1 + 2k$.
$2a = 2b + n (1 + 2k)$.
$2(a - b) = n (1 + 2k)$.
Since $n$ is odd, $n$ must divide $a
