Problem:
Which one of the following is the least correct statement about the following post-transcription processes?


Answer Choices:
(A) Some histone mRNAs end in a stem loop structure instead of poly-A tail 
(B) In animals, the introns in the primary messenger RNA for canonical histones are removed within the nucleus
(C) A mature messenger RNA may carry different combinations of exons from the original primary transcript
(D) Sometimes, the portion of RNA transcribed from an intron can cut itself out of the primary messenger RNA without the need for a spliceosome

Domain: Combinatorics

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let's break down each statement and evaluate its correctness in the context of post-transcription processes.

**Statement A: Some histone mRNAs end in a stem loop structure instead of a poly-A tail.**

* **Knowledge:**  Histone mRNAs are a special case among eukaryotic mRNAs. They are known for *not* having a poly-A tail in most cases. Instead, they have a specific stem-loop structure at their 3' end, which is crucial for their stability and processing.
* **Evaluation:** This statement aligns with known biology. It's generally *correct*.

**Statement B: In animals, the introns in the primary messenger RNA for canonical histones are removed within the nucleus.**

* **Knowledge:**  Intron removal (splicing) is a fundamental post-transcriptional process. It occurs within the nucleus where the primary transcript is located.
* **Specific to Histones:** Canonical histones are a bit of an exception regarding splicing. While most eukaryotic genes contain introns that are spliced out by the spliceosome, *canonical histone genes in animals typically do not contain introns*. This is a key characteristic of these genes.
* **Evaluation:** This statement is *incorrect* because canonical histone mRNAs *don't have introns* that need to be removed.

**Statement C: A mature messenger RNA may carry different combinations of exons from the original primary transcript.**

* **Knowledge:** This describes alternative splicing. It's a major post-transcriptional process where different combinations of exons can be included in the mature mRNA, leading to multiple protein isoforms from a single gene.
* **Evaluation:** This statement is *correct*.

**Statement D: Sometimes, the portion of RNA transcribed from an intron can cut itself out of the primary messenger RNA without the need for a spliceosome.**

* **Knowledge:** This describes self-splicing introns, also known as ribozymes. These are catalytic RNA molecules that can catalyze their own excision from a precursor RNA molecule. This process does not require the protein components of the spliceosome.
* **Evaluation:** This statement is *correct*.

**Identifying the Least Correct Statement:**

Based on the evaluations above:

* (A) Correct
* (B) Incorrect (canonical histones lack introns)
* (C) Correct
* (D) Correct

Therefore, statement (B) is the least correct.

**Confirmation and Refinement (Self-Correction):**

Double-checking the terminology: "canonical histones" is the key here. There are other types of histones, but the question specifically mentions "canonical histones." The defining feature of their mRNA processing is the lack of introns (in animals).

Final Answer: (B)
