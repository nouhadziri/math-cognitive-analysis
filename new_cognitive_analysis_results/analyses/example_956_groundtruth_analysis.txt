Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
### Part (1)
1. **Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve \( y = \frac{8}{27}x^3 \) at a point \( (t, \frac{8}{27}t^3) \):**
   \[
   \text{Slope of the tangent line} = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{8}{27}x^3\right) = \frac{8}{9}x^2 \bigg|_{x=t} = \frac{8}{9}t^2
   \]
   The equation of the tangent line at \( (t, \frac{8}{27}t^3) \) is:
   \[
   y - \frac{8}{27}t^3 = \frac{8}{9}t^2(x - t)
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   y = \frac{8}{9}t^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t^3
   \]

2. **Find the condition for this tangent line to also be tangent to the parabola \( y = (x + a)^2 \):**
   Substitute \( y = \frac{8}{9}t^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t^3 \) into \( y = (x + a)^2 \):
   \[
   \frac{8}{9}t^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t^3 = (x + a)^2
   \]
   Rearrange to form a quadratic equation in \( x \):
   \[
   (x + a)^2 - \frac{8}{9}t^2 x + \frac{16}{27}t^3 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x^2 + 2ax + a^2 - \frac{8}{9}t^2 x + \frac{16}{27}t^3 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x^2 + \left(2a - \frac{8}{9}t^2\right)x + a^2 + \frac{16}{27}t^3 = 0
   \]

3. **For the line to be tangent to the parabola, the quadratic equation must have a double root:**
   The discriminant of the quadratic equation must be zero:
   \[
   \left(2a - \frac{8}{9}t^2\right)^2 - 4 \left(a^2 + \frac{16}{27}t^3\right) = 0
   \]
   Simplify the discriminant:
   \[
   \left(2a - \frac{8}{9}t^2\right)^2 = 4 \left(a^2 + \frac{16}{27}t^3\right)
   \]
   \[
   4a^2 - \frac{32}{9}at^2 + \frac{64}{81}t^4 = 4a^2 + \frac{64}{27}t^3
   \]
   \[
   - \frac{32}{9}at^2 + \frac{64}{81}t^4 = \frac{64}{27}t^3
   \]
   \[
   - \frac{32}{9}at^2 + \frac{64}{81}t^4 - \frac{64}{27}t^3 = 0
   \]
   \[
   \frac{64}{81}t^4 - \frac{64}{27}t^3 - \frac{32}{9}at^2 = 0
   \]
   \[
   \frac{64}{81}t^2(t^2 - 3t - \frac{27}{2}a) = 0
   \]
   \[
   t^2 - 3t - \frac{27}{2}a = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for \( t \):**
   \[
   t = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 54a}}{2}
   \]
   For \( t \) to have two distinct real solutions, the discriminant must be positive:
   \[
   9 + 54a > 0
   \]
   \[
   a > -\frac{1}{6}
   \]

5. **Combine with the condition \( t \neq 0 \):**
   \[
   a \neq 0
   \]
   Therefore, the range of \( a \) is:
   \[
   -\frac{1}{6} < a < 0 \quad \text{or} \quad a > 0
   \]

### Part (2)
1. **Find the roots \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) of the quadratic equation \( t^2 - 3t - \frac{27}{2}a = 0 \):**
   \[
   \alpha = \frac{3 - \sqrt{9 + 54a}}{2}, \quad \beta = \frac{3 + \sqrt{9 + 54a}}{2}
   \]

2. **Find the \( x \)-coordinates of the points of tangency \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \):**
   From the quadratic equation \( x^2 + \left(2a - \frac{8}{9}t^2\right)x + a^2 + \frac{16}{27}t^3 = 0 \):
   \[
   x_1 = -a + \frac{4}{9}\alpha^2, \quad x_2 = -a + \frac{4}{9}\beta^2
   \]

3. **Calculate the area \( S \) bounded by the two tangent lines and the parabola \( y = (x + a)^2 \):**
   \[
   S = \int_{x_1}^{\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}} (x - x_1)^2 \, dx + \int_{\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}}^{x_2} (x - x_2)^2 \, dx
   \]
   \[
   S = \frac{1}{12}(x_2 - x_1)^3
   \]
   \[
   x_2 - x_1 = \frac{4}{9}(\beta^2 - \alpha^2)
   \]
   \[
   \beta^2 - \alpha^2 = (\beta + \alpha)(\beta - \alpha) = 3\sqrt{1 + 2a}
   \]
   \[
   S = \frac{1}{12}\left(\frac{4}{9} \cdot 3 \cdot 3\sqrt{1 + 2a}\right)^3
   \]
   \[
   S = \frac{16}{3}(2a + 1)^{\frac{3}{2}}
   \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{16}{3}(2a + 1)^{\frac{3}{2}}}\)
