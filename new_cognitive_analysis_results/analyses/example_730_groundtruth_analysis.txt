Problem:
There are two distinguishable flagpoles, and there are $19$ flags, of which $10$ are identical blue flags, and $9$ are identical green flags. Let $N$ be the number of distinguishable arrangements using all of the flags in which each flagpole has at least one flag and no two green flags on either pole are adjacent. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$ .

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
310

Analysis:
I notice that the thinking trajectory provided is extremely brief, consisting only of "310" which appears to be the final answer. Without a detailed solution process to analyze, I cannot identify specific cognitive skills being demonstrated in the problem-solving process. 

To properly analyze cognitive skills, I would need to see the solver's thinking process, steps taken, and reasoning that led to the answer of 310. The brief answer alone doesn't provide insight into the mathematical reasoning, problem decomposition, pattern recognition, or other cognitive skills that would have been used to solve this complex combinatorial problem.

If you could provide the actual thinking trajectory showing how the solver arrived at 310, I would be happy to analyze the cognitive skills demonstrated in that process.
