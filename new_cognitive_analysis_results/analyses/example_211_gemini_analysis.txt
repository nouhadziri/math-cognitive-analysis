Problem:
(d) The one-dimensional diffusion equation (also called the "heat equation") is given (for a free particle) by

$$
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=a \frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial x^{2}}
\tag{5}
$$

A spatial wave can be written as $\sim e^{i k x}$ (larger $k$ 's correspond to waves oscillating on smaller length scales). Guessing a solution $\psi(x, t)=A e^{i k x-i \omega t}$, find $\omega$ in terms of k. A relationship of this time is called a "dispersion relation."

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
The problem asks us to find the dispersion relation for the one-dimensional diffusion equation.
The diffusion equation is given by $\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=a \frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial x^{2}}$.
We are asked to guess a solution of the form $\psi(x, t)=A e^{i k x-i \omega t}$ and find the relationship between $\omega$ and $k$.

Let's first calculate the partial derivatives required for the diffusion equation.
$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (A e^{i k x-i \omega t})$
Using the chain rule, $\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = A e^{i k x-i \omega t} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (i k x-i \omega t)$
$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = A e^{i k x-i \omega t} (-i \omega)$
$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -i \omega A e^{i k x-i \omega t}$

Now let's calculate the second spatial derivative.
$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (A e^{i k x-i \omega t})$
Using the chain rule, $\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = A e^{i k x-i \omega t} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (i k x-i \omega t)$
$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = A e^{i k x-i \omega t} (i k)$
$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = i k A e^{i k x-i \omega t}$

Now, let's calculate the second derivative with respect to $x$.
$\frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial x^{2}} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (i k A e^{i k x-i \omega t})$
$\frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial x^{2}} = i k A \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (e^{i k x-i \omega t})$
$\frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial x^{2}} = i k A (i k e^{i k x-i \omega t})$
$\frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial x^{2}} = (i k)^2 A e^{i k x-i \omega t}$
$\frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial x^{2}} = -k^2 A e^{i k x-i \omega t}$

Now we substitute these derivatives into the diffusion equation:
$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=a \frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial x^{2}}$
$-i \omega A e^{i k x-i \omega t} = a (-k^2 A e^{i k x-i \omega t})$

We can cancel out the common terms $A e^{i k x-i \omega t}$ from both sides (assuming $A \neq 0$).
$-i \omega = -a k^2$

Now, we solve for $\omega$ in terms of $k$.
$\omega = \frac{-a k^2}{-i}$
$\omega = \frac{a k^2}{i}$

To express this in a standard form without $i$ in the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $-i$.
$\omega = \frac{a k^2}{i} \times \frac{-i}{-i}$
$\omega = \frac{-i a k^2}{-i^2}$
$\omega = \frac{-i a k^2}{-(-1)}$
$\omega = \frac{-i a k^2}{1}$
$\omega = -i a k^2$

The dispersion relation is the relationship between $\omega$ and $k$. In this case, $\omega = -i a k^2$.

Let's double check the calculations.
$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -i \omega \psi$
$\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} = (ik)^2 \psi = -k^2 \psi$
Substitute into the equation:
$-i \omega \psi = a (-k^2 \psi)$
$-i \omega = -a k^2$
$\omega = \frac{-a k^2}{-i} = -i a k^2$

The result seems correct. The dispersion relation for the diffusion equation has an imaginary component. This indicates that the wave is not propagating without damping or growth, but rather its amplitude changes over time.
