Problem:
Which of the following products of gamma matrices is Hermitian?
Answer Choices:
(A) i gamma0 * gamma0 * gamma2* gamma3
(B) i gamma0 * gamma1 * gamma2 * gamma3
(C) i gamma0 * gamma0 * gamma1 * gamma1
(D) i gamma1 * gamma1 * gamma2* gamma3

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
i gamma0 * gamma1 * gamma2 * gamma3 should be recognized as gamma5, a crucial structure in relativistic spinor theory. It is Hermitian. The quickest way to confirm correctness is to note that gamma1, gamma2, gamma3 (the space-like gammas) are all anti-Hermitian, while gamma0 is Hermitian. Therefore any product of an odd number of space-like gammas is anti-Hermitian, and the factor of i makes this product Hermitian. Only the correct answer choice has an odd number of space-like gammas.

Answer: B
