Problem:
One base of a trapezoid is $100$ units longer than the other base. The segment that joins the midpoints of the legs divides the trapezoid into two regions whose areas are in the ratio $2: 3$ . Let $x$ be the length of the segment joining the legs of the trapezoid that is parallel to the bases and that divides the trapezoid into two regions of equal area. Find the greatest integer that does not exceed $x^2/100$ .

<text>181</text>
<explanation>The entire solution demonstrates mathematical modeling, as the solver has translated the geometric problem about a trapezoid with specific area conditions into mathematical equations and variables. While we only see the final answer (181), it's clear the solver successfully modeled the trapezoid's properties, the relationships between its parts, and the constraints about area ratios to arrive at this value for x²/100.</explanation>

<skill>Geometric Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to understand, analyze, and manipulate geometric shapes, their properties, and spatial relationships.</definition>

<text>181</text>
<explanation>The problem involves a trapezoid and relationships between its parts (bases, legs, midpoints, areas of regions). The solver has clearly applied geometric reasoning to understand how the trapezoid is divided by various segments, how these divisions affect areas, and how to relate the segment lengths to the area ratios. Though we only see the final answer, reaching it required sophisticated geometric reasoning about trapezoids and their properties.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to work with symbolic representations, manipulate equations, and solve for unknown variables using algebraic operations.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>181</end>
<text>181</text>
<explanation>To arrive at the answer of 181, the solver must have set up algebraic equations representing the relationships between the bases, the areas of the regions, and the position of the segment that creates equal areas. They would have needed to solve these equations algebraically to find the value of x, and then calculate x²/100 to determine the greatest integer that doesn't exceed this value.</explanation>

<skill>Quantitative Estimation</skill>
<definition>The ability to make reasonable approximations or judgments about numerical values without performing exact calculations.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>181</end>
<text>181</text>
<explanation>The final part of the problem asks for "the greatest integer that does not exceed x²/100". This requires the solver to determine the exact value of x²/100 and then find the integer part of this value. The answer 181 suggests that x²/100 is between 181 and 182, meaning the solver correctly identified the integer bound.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Knowledge Application</skill>
<definition>The ability to select and apply appropriate mathematical theorems, formulas, or principles that are relevant to solving a specific problem.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>181</end>
<text>181</text>
<explanation>The solver has demonstrated knowledge of how to calculate areas of trapezoids, how to work with midpoints of segments, and how to relate parallel segments in a trapezoid to the areas they create. They've strategically applied formulas for area ratios and likely used the fact that the area of a trapezoid is the average of the parallel sides multiplied by the height.</explanation>
