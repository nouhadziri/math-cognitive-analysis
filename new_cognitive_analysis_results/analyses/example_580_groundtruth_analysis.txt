Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
### Part (i): Prove that \( G \) is abelian if \( |G| = 2^n \)

1. **Consider arbitrary elements \( a \) and \( b \) in \( G \):**
   Let \( a, b \in G \). We need to show that \( ab = ba \).

2. **Use the given property:**
   We know that if \( a^2 b = b a^2 \), then \( ab = ba \).

3. **Analyze the order of \( a \):**
   Since \( |G| = 2^n \), the order of any element \( a \in G \) must be a power of 2. Let the order of \( a \) be \( 2^k \) for some \( k \leq n \). This means \( a^{2^k} = e \), where \( e \) is the identity element in \( G \).

4. **Apply the given property iteratively:**
   - Since \( a^{2^k} = e \), we have \( a^{2^k} b = b a^{2^k} \).
   - This implies \( e b = b e \), which is trivially true.
   - Now consider \( a^{2^{k-1}} \). Since \( a^{2^k} = e \), we have \( (a^{2^{k-1}})^2 = e \). Therefore, \( a^{2^{k-1}} \) is an element of order 2.
   - By the given property, \( a^{2^{k-1}} b = b a^{2^{k-1}} \).

5. **Continue the process:**
   - Next, consider \( a^{2^{k-2}} \). Since \( (a^{2^{k-1}})^2 = e \), we have \( (a^{2^{k-2}})^4 = e \). Therefore, \( a^{2^{k-2}} \) is an element of order 4.
   - By the given property, \( a^{2^{k-2}} b = b a^{2^{k-2}} \).

6. **Repeat until \( k = 1 \):**
   - Continue this process until we reach \( a^2 \). Since \( a^2 b = b a^2 \), by the given property, we have \( ab = ba \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   Since \( a \) and \( b \) were arbitrary elements of \( G \), we have shown that \( G \) is abelian.

\(\blacksquare\)

### Part (ii): Example of a non-abelian group with the given property

1. **Consider the quaternion group \( Q_8 \):**
   The quaternion group \( Q_8 \) is a non-abelian group of order 8 (which is \( 2^3 \)). The elements of \( Q_8 \) are \( \{1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k\} \) with the following multiplication rules:
   - \( i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1 \)
   - \( ij = k, ji = -k \)
   - \( jk = i, kj = -i \)
   - \( ki = j, ik = -j \)

2. **Verify the given property:**
   - For any \( a, b \in Q_8 \), if \( a^2 b = b a^2 \), we need to check if \( ab = ba \).
   - Consider \( a = i \) and \( b = j \). We have \( i^2 = -1 \) and \( j^2 = -1 \).
   - \( i^2 j = -j \) and \( j i^2 = -j \), so \( i^2 j = j i^2 \).
   - However, \( ij = k \) and \( ji = -k \), so \( ij \neq ji \).

3. **Conclusion:**
   The quaternion group \( Q_8 \) satisfies the given property but is non-abelian.
