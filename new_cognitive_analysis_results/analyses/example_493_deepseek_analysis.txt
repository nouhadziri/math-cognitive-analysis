Let $AD=p\cdot AB$ , $BE=q\cdot BC$ , and $CF=r\cdot CA$ , where $p$ , $q$ , and $r$ are positive and satisfy $p+q+r=2/3$ and $p^2+q^2+r^2=2/5$ .

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Alright, so I came across this geometry problem involving a triangle with sides 13, 15, 17. Points D, E, F are on the sides AB, BC, and CA respectively. The problem gives me that AD = p·AB, BE = q·BC, and CF = r·CA, where p, q, r are positive numbers satisfying p + q + r = 2/3 and p2 + q2 + r2 = 2/5. I need to find the ratio of the area of triangle DEF to the area of triangle ABC, expressed as m/n where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n.

First, let me try to visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB = 13, BC = 15, CA = 17. Points D on AB, E on BC, F on CA. The positions of D, E, F are determined by parameters p, q, r respectively. The conditions given are p + q + r = 2/3 and p2 + q2 + r2 = 2/5. These conditions will probably allow me to find cross terms like pq + qr + rp, since from (p + q + r)2 = p2 + q2 + r2 + 2(pq + qr + rp), I can solve for pq + pr + qr.

Let me compute that first:

(p + q + r)2 = (2/3)2 = 4/9

Given that p2 + q2 + r2 = 2/5, then

4/9 = 2/5 + 2(pq + qr + pr)

Therefore,

2(pq + qr + pr) = 4/9 - 2/5 = (20/45 - 18/45) = 2/45

Hence, pq + qr + pr = 1/45

So that's an important relationship.

Now, the main challenge is to relate these parameters p, q, r to the area of triangle DEF. Since DEF is a triangle formed by points on the sides of ABC, I think this might be a case where we can use barycentric coordinates or area ratios determined by the parameters.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me consider coordinate geometry. Maybe it would help to assign coordinates to triangle ABC. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area of a triangle formed by lines cutting the sides proportionally. I remember there is a formula related to the area ratio when points divide the sides in certain ratios, something like if the cevians divide the sides in ratios p, q, r, then the area ratio is 1 - (p + q + r) + (pq + qr + pr) - ...? Wait, maybe Routh's theorem? Does that apply here? Wait, Routh's theorem involves three cevians dividing the sides in ratios, and the ratio of areas. Let me check that.

But given that the problem states AD = p·AB, which means that D divides AB such that AD = p·AB, so the ratio AD/AB = p, which would make BD/AB = (1 - p). Similarly, BE = q·BC, so E divides BC such that BE/BC = q, so EC/BC = 1 - q. Similarly, CF = r·CA, so F divides CA such that CF/CA = r, hence FA/CA = 1 - r.

Wait, in that case, the coordinates of D, E, F can be written in terms of p, q, r. Then, the problem is about finding the area of DEF in terms of ABC's area. Since they gave the sides of ABC, maybe I need to compute its area first.

So, perhaps first, let me compute the area of triangle ABC using Heron's formula. The sides are 13, 15, 17.

The semi-perimeter, s = (13 + 15 + 17)/2 = (45)/2 = 22.5

Area = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = √[22.5*(22.5 - 13)(22.5 - 15)(22.5 - 17)] = √[22.5*9.5*7.5*5.5]

Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe it can be simplified.

Alternatively, perhaps the area isn't necessary? Maybe the ratio can be found without computing the actual area? Let me think. If I can express the area ratio in terms of p, q, r, then maybe with the given values of p + q + r and p2 + q2 + r2, I can compute the area ratio without needing the specific coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe vector coordinates. Let me outline a possible approach.

Let me place triangle ABC in the plane, maybe with coordinates. Let me set point A at (0,0), point B at (13,0). Then point C is somewhere in the plane, and distances from A to C is 17, from B to C is 15. Let me compute the coordinates of point C.

Coordinates:

Let me call A(0,0), B(13,0), and C(x,y). Then, AC = 17, so x2 + y2 = 172 = 289

BC = 15, so (x - 13)^2 + y2 = 152 = 225

Subtracting these equations:

(x - 13)^2 + y2 - x2 - y2 = 225 - 289

Expanding (x2 -26x + 169) + y2 - x2 - y2 = -64

Simplify: -26x + 169 = -64 => -26x = -233 => x = 233/26 ≈ 8.96. Let me compute 233 ÷ 26.

26*8 = 208, 233 -208 = 25, so 25/26 ≈ 0.9615, so x ≈ 8.9615

Then, compute y:

From x2 + y2 = 289,

y2 = 289 - x2 = 289 - (233/26)2

Compute 233 squared: 233*233. Let's see:

2002 = 40000, 332=1089, 2*200*33 = 13200

So (200 + 33)^2 = 2002 + 2*200*33 + 332 = 40000 + 13200 + 1089 = 40000 + 14289 = 54289

Wait, so (233)^2 = 54289. Then x2 = (233/26)^2 = 54289/676

Therefore, y2 = 289 - 54289/676

Convert 289 to 289*676/676 = (289*676)/676

289*676: Hmm, 289 is 172, and 676 is 262. But anyway:

289 = 289/1, so 289 *676 = 289*600 + 289*76 = 173400 + 21964 = 195,364

Therefore, y2 = (195,364 - 54,289)/676 = (195364 - 54289)/676 = 141,075/676

Then y = sqrt(141075/676) = sqrt(141075)/26

Simplify sqrt(141075). Let's factor 141075:

Divide 141075 by 25: 141075 /25 = 5643

So sqrt(25 * 5643) =5*sqrt(5643)

Now, factor 5643.

Let me check if 5643 is divisible by 3: 5+6+4+3=18, which is divisible by 3. So 5643 ÷3=1881

1881 ÷3=627

627 ÷3=209

209 is 11*19

Thus, 5643=3^3*11*19

Therefore sqrt(5643)=3^(3/2)*sqrt(11*19)=3*sqrt(3*11*19). So sqrt(5643)=3*sqrt(627)

Therefore, y=5*sqrt(5643)/26=5*3*sqrt(627)/26=15 sqrt(627)/26

But this seems rather complicated, and perhaps this approach will get too calculation-heavy. Maybe there's a better way to find the area ratio.

Alternatively, since Heron's formula was getting messy, perhaps compute area another way.

Alternatively, perhaps coordinates are not the way to go. Let me recall that area ratios can sometimes be determined using determinants or using barycentric coordinates.

Alternatively, the problem might have some symmetry or a formula that can be applied directly given the values of p + q + r and p2 + q2 + r2.

I remember that when points are taken along the sides of a triangle, the area of the inner triangle can sometimes be expressed in terms of the products of the ratios. But given that DEF is formed by points D, E, F on the sides, maybe there's a formula similar to 1 - (sum of ratios) + (sum of product of ratios) - (product of ratios)?

Wait, in Routh's theorem, the area ratio is given by (pqr + (1 - p - q - r)) / something. Wait, maybe I need to recall Routh's theorem.

Routh's theorem states that if on each side of a triangle, a point is chosen such that the cevians divide the sides in ratios r, s, t respectively, then the ratio of the area of the inner triangle to the original triangle is:

\[\frac{(rst - 1)^2}{(rs + r + 1)(st + s + 1)(tr + t + 1)}\]

Wait, no, perhaps that's not exactly right. Alternatively, Routh's theorem is more general. For instance, if the cevians divide the sides in the ratio of λ, μ, ν, then the ratio of areas is:

\[\frac{(λμν - 1)^2}{(λμ + μ + 1)(μν + ν + 1)(νλ + λ + 1)}\]

Wait, maybe I need to look up Routh's theorem formula.

But given it's a competition problem, perhaps there's a way to use the given conditions p + q + r = 2/3 and p2 + q2 + r2 = 2/5, along with whatever cross terms, to compute the area.

Alternatively, perhaps use vectors.

Assume triangle ABC with vectors A, B, C.

Then points D, E, F can be expressed in terms of vectors. Then the area of DEF can be calculated via the cross product.

But since I know the coordinates, perhaps assign coordinates and then use coordinates to compute the area ratio.

Alternatively, given that the area of ABC can be computed, regardless of coordinate positions. Let me compute the area of ABC using Heron's formula, just to have that value.

So as before, sides: 13, 15, 17

Compute semi-perimeter: s = (13 + 15 + 17)/2 = 45/2 = 22.5

Area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[22.5*(22.5 -13)(22.5 -15)(22.5 -17)] = sqrt[22.5 * 9.5 * 7.5 * 5.5]

Convert to fractions:

22.5 = 45/2

9.5 = 19/2

7.5 = 15/2

5.5 = 11/2

Therefore, product inside sqrt:

(45/2)*(19/2)*(15/2)*(11/2) = (45*19*15*11)/(2^4) = (45*15)*(19*11)/16 = (675)*(209)/16

Compute 675*209:

Let me compute 675*200 = 135,000; 675*9 = 6,075; total is 135,000 + 6,075 = 141,075

Therefore, the product is 141,075 / 16

Thus, area = sqrt(141075 / 16) = sqrt(141075)/4

Compute sqrt(141075):

From previous calculation, sqrt(141075) = sqrt(25 * 5643) = 5*sqrt(5643)

Then, as we saw, 5643=3^3*11*19. So sqrt(5643)=3*sqrt(3*11*19)= 3*sqrt(627)

Therefore, area = (5*3*sqrt(627))/4 = (15 sqrt(627))/4

So area of ABC is (15 sqrt(627))/4. Hmm, this seems messy, but perhaps the ratio between DEF and ABC can be calculated in terms of p, q, r without needing the actual area.

Let me explore a different approach, maybe using barycentric coordinates.

In barycentric coordinates with respect to triangle ABC, the coordinates of points D, E, F can be expressed based on the ratios along the edges.

But since barycentric coordinates can represent points as weighted averages. For example, point D is on AB, with AD = p·AB. Therefore, in barycentric coordinates, D would have coordinates (1 - p, p, 0). Wait, no, barycentric coordinates typically sum to 1, but if considering normalized coordinates. Wait, here, since D is on AB, its barycentric coordinates would be (1 - p, p, 0). But the issue is that the coordinates must satisfy u + v + w = 1, but D is on AB, so w = 0, and u = 1 - p, v = p. Wait, if AD = p·AB, then D is along AB such that the ratio AD/AB = p. So the barycentric coordinates would be (u, v, w) where u corresponds to A, v to B, w to C. Since D is on AB, w = 0. Then, to express the position along AB, if we let u = (1 - p), v = p, w = 0?

Wait, barycentric coordinates might be mass point coordinates where the masses are proportional. Alternatively, parametric coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps coordinates can be represented as follows:

Let me try to define coordinates as follows: Let me take A as (0,0), B as (1,0), and C as (0,1). Wait, but the actual triangle in the problem has sides of length 13,15,17. But perhaps if I use normalized coordinates, but given the different side lengths, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps use parametric coordinates where all operations are proportional.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use affine combinations.

Suppose we are in triangle ABC. Let me model ABC as a coordinate system with A at the origin (0,0), B at (1,0), and C at (0,1). Then, the coordinates of points D, E, F can be expressed as:

Point D is on AB such that AD = p·AB. Since AB is from (0,0) to (1,0), then AD = p·AB would mean moving p fraction along AB. So in coordinates, D would be at (p, 0).

Similarly, point E is on BC such that BE = q·BC. Since BC is from (1,0) to (0,1), then BE = q·BC. The vector BC is (-1,1). So starting from B (1,0), moving q fraction along BC gives point E as B + q·BC = (1,0) + q*(-1,1) = (1 - q, q).

Similarly, point F is on CA such that CF = r·CA. CA is from C (0,1) to A (0,0), which is (0,-1). Starting from C (0,1), moving r fraction along CA gives point F as (0,1) + r*(0,-1) = (0,1 - r).

Wait, hold on, but in the problem statement, CF = r·CA. If CA is the vector from C to A, then CF is r times that vector. So starting at C, moving towards A by r times CA, which would be equivalent to CA * r.

But CA is a length of 17 in the problem, but in this coordinate system, CA is length 1. Wait, perhaps scaling is an issue here.

Wait, maybe there's an underlying coordinate system where assigning ABC to be (0,0), (1,0), (0,1) is not proportional to the actual triangle with sides 13, 15, 17. Therefore, I might have to handle scaling factors.

Alternatively, maybe the approach of parametric coordinates is possible regardless of the actual side lengths, but maybe the area ratio will end up the same, as ratios don't depend on scaling. But probably not, since different side lengths affect coordinates, hence areas. Hmm, I need to check.

Wait, in area ratios in affine geometry, ratios are preserved under affine transformations. Since DEF is constructed via points divided proportionally on the sides, affine transformations can take any triangle to another triangle, preserving the ratios. Therefore, maybe I can compute the area ratio in a normalized coordinate system and get the same result as in the given triangle.

That would make sense. Since affine transformations preserve ratios and area ratios, even if the original triangle is scaled or skewed. Therefore, perhaps we can compute the area ratio in a simpler coordinate system, such as the unit triangle.

Therefore, let me assume triangle ABC is a triangle with coordinates A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0,1). Then compute the coordinates of D, E, F in terms of p, q, r, compute the area of DEF, and then find the ratio.

Given that, as per the problem, AD = p·AB. Here, AB in this coordinate system is from (0,0) to (1,0). So vector AB is (1,0). Therefore, AD = p·AB would take us from A (0,0) by p·AB, resulting in point D(p, 0). Similarly, BE = q·BC. BC is from B(1,0) to C(0,1), vector (-1,1). Then BE is q·BC = (-q, q), so starting at B(1,0), E is at (1 - q, 0 + q) = (1 - q, q). Similarly, CF = r·CA. CA is from C(0,1) to A(0,0), vector (0,-1). So CF = r·CA = (0, -r), so starting at C(0,1), point F is at (0, 1 - r).

Now, points D(p, 0), E(1 - q, q), F(0,1 - r). The area of triangle DEF can be found using the determinant formula:

Area = (1/2) | (x_D(y_E - y_F) + x_E(y_F - y_D) + x_F(y_D - y_E)) |.

Plugging in coordinates:

x_D = p, y_D = 0

x_E = 1 - q, y_E = q

x_F = 0, y_F = 1 - r

Therefore,

Area of DEF = (1/2)| p*(q - (1 - r)) + (1 - q)*((1 - r) - 0) + 0*(0 - q) |

Simplify:

First Term: p*(q - 1 + r) = p*(q + r - 1)

Second Term: (1 - q)*(1 - r)

Third Term: 0

Thus,

Area DEF = (1/2)| p(q + r -1) + (1 - q)(1 - r) |

Let me convert that:

= (1/2)| p(q + r - 1) + (1 - q - r + qr) |

= (1/2)| p(q + r - 1) + 1 - q - r + qr |

Now, note that in terms of the given variables, p + q + r = 2/3. Therefore, q + r = 2/3 - p.

Also, perhaps substitute variables to express stuff in terms of known sums.

Wait, substitute q + r = 2/3 - p into the expression:

Inside the absolute value:

p( (2/3 - p) -1 ) +1 - (2/3 - p) + qr

= p(2/3 - p - 1) +1 -2/3 + p + qr

Simplify each term:

First term: p(-1/3 -p ) = - (p)/3 - p2

Second term: (1 -2/3) + p + qr = (1/3) + p + qr

Combine all terms:

- (p)/3 - p2 + 1/3 + p + qr

= (-p/3 + p) + (-p2) + 1/3 + qr

= (2p/3) - p2 + 1/3 + qr

Therefore,

Area DEF = (1/2)| (2p/3 - p2 + 1/3 + qr) |

But area is positive, so absolute value can be removed.

Therefore,

Area DEF = (1/2)(2p/3 - p2 + 1/3 + qr)

Simplify expression:

= (1/2)[ (1/3 + 2p/3 - p2) + qr ]

Similarly, 1/3 + 2p/3 can be written as (1 + 2p)/3, but perhaps it's better to keep as is.

Now, note that we need to express in terms of the given quantities. We have p + q + r = 2/3 and p2 + q2 + r2 = 2/5.

Earlier, we found pq + qr + rp = 1/45.

But how do we relate qr? Since in the expression above, there is only a qr term. To compute qr, we need to relate the cross products. Since we know pq + pr + qr = 1/45, so qr = 1/45 - p(q + r) = 1/45 - p*(2/3 - p)

Similarly, since qr = 1/45 - p(2/3 - p)

Therefore, substituting back into the area expression:

Area DEF = (1/2)[ 2p/3 - p2 + 1/3 + (1/45 - p(2/3 - p)) ]

Let me compute term by term:

First term inside the brackets: 2p/3

Second term: -p2

Third term: 1/3

Fourth term: 1/45

Fifth term: -p*(2/3 - p) = - (2p/3 - p2) = -2p/3 + p2

Therefore, combining all terms:

2p/3 - p2 + 1/3 + 1/45 -2p/3 + p2

Observe that:

2p/3 -2p/3 cancels out.

-p2 + p2 cancels out.

Leaving 1/3 + 1/45

Which is equal to (15/45 + 1/45) = 16/45

Thus, Area DEF = (1/2)(16/45) = 8/45

Therefore, the ratio of areas DEF to ABC is 8/45.

Wait, hold on. This seems surprisingly clean. But let me verify:

Wait, so in normalized coordinates where ABC has coordinates A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0,1). The area of ABC in this coordinate system is 0.5, since it's a right triangle with base 1 and height 1. But in reality, in our given coordinate system, DEF area was computed as 8/45, and ABC area is 1/2, so the ratio is (8/45) / (1/2) ) = 16/45 ≈ 0.3555...

But this contradicts with the later steps. Wait, actually in the normalized coordinate system, the area of ABC is 1/2.

Wait, in our calculation above, we computed DEF's area as 8/45. Therefore, the ratio of DEF to ABC in this coordinate system would be (8/45)/(1/2) = 16/45. Therefore, assuming that area ratios are preserved under affine transformations (since affine transformations preserve ratios and parallelism), this ratio 16/45 would hold in the original triangle ABC.

But wait, in my earlier steps, when I computed DEF's area as 8/45, with the coordinate system ABC having area 1/2. However, when applying to the actual triangle ABC, since areas are different, the ratio remains consistent.

But the key insight here is that in any affine coordinate system, area ratios are preserved. Therefore, 16/45 should be the ratio.

But according to the above computation:

The area DEF in normalized coordinates is 8/45, original ABC area is 1/2. Therefore, ratio is (8/45) / (1/2) ) = 16/45. So the answer would be 16/45, m + n = 16 +45=61.

But wait, wait. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, in the normalized coordinate system ABC with points at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), the area of ABC is 1/2.

But when we computed the area of DEF as (1/2)[ expression ] which came out as 8/45. Then, the ratio DEF / ABC would be (8/45)/(1/2) = 16/45. Hence, indeed 16/45, which would reduce to 16/45 if they are coprime. Since 16 and 45 share no common divisors, 16 + 45 = 61.

Wait, the problem states that ABC has sides AB=13, BC=15, CA=17. However, in our normalized coordinate system, ABC is a right triangle with sides AB=1, BC=√2, CA=1. So clearly different from the given triangle. However, affine transformations preserve area ratios. Therefore, the ratio DEF / ABC would still be 16/45, regardless of the actual triangle's shape.

But let me get back to the step-by-step.

In the normalized coordinate system, DEF area / ABC area = 16/45, leading to the answer 16/45 and sum 61.

But let me check this with another method.

Alternatively, consider the formula for the area of a triangle formed by three points on the sides. Suppose D, E, F divide AB, BC, CA in ratio AD/AB = p, BE/BC = q, CF/CA = r.

Suppose p + q + r = 2/3 and p2 + q2 + r2 = 2/5, and pq + qr + rp = 1/45.

I needed to find the area DEF / ABC.

There is a well-known formula for the area of DEF in terms of p, q, r.

But, if DEF is formed by points D, E, F on sides AB, BC, CA respectively, then the area ratio can be expressed as:

Area DEF / Area ABC = (1 - p - q - r + pq + qr + rp)

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify with some special cases.

If p = q = r = t, then Area DEF / Area ABC = 1 - 3t + 3t2, which doesn't match standard formula.

Wait, alternatively, maybe Area DEF = Area ABC - (Area ADF + Area BDE + Area CEF). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps expressing DEF in terms of p, q, r parameters. Alternatively, consider a more general formula.

Alternatively, note that in barycentric coordinates, the area ratio can be expressed as:

If points D, E, F are on the edges of triangle ABC with barycentric coordinates related to p, q, r as given, then the area of DEF is |determinant| / 2.

Alternatively, in another approach, using the affine coordinate system (like the one I used earlier), since in the normalized triangle, DEF's area was computed as 16/45 of ABC.

But let's see: If in our normalized coordinate system, ABC is area 1/2, then DEF is 8/45, hence the ratio is 16/45, which translates directly to the original triangle. Hence the answer is 16/45.

Alternatively, the problem may expect different approach. Suppose that in triangle ABC, we use mass point or another area method.

Alternatively, use the formula for the area of a sub-triangle using Ceva's theorem? Not sure.

Alternatively, using the formula from the following source, which says that if D, E, F are points on AB, BC, CA with normalized parameters p, q, r, then the area ratio is (p q + q r + r p - 2 p q r). Hmm, not sure if this is standard.

Alternatively, according to another source, the area ratio can be computed by S(DEF)/S(ABC) = 1 - (p + q + r) + (pq + qr + rp) - pqr. Wait, let's test this.

If we set p = q = r = t, then:

Ratio = 1 - 3t + 3t2 - t3.

For example, if t = 0, ratio is 1 (correct). If t = 1, ratio = 1 -3 +3 -1 = 0 (correct).

But in this problem, does that formula apply?

Let me check with the normalized coordinate system example I did earlier.

In that case, p + q + r = 2/3, and pq + qr + pr = 1/45, and we'll also need to compute pqr.

Then, Ratio = 1 - (2/3) + (1/45) - pqr.

But according to earlier computation, the ratio was 16/45, so 16/45 = 1 - 2/3 + 1/45 - pqr.

Compute 1 - 2/3 = 1/3; 1/3 + 1/45 = 15/45 + 1/45 = 16/45.

Therefore, this suggests that in this formula, the Ratio is (1 - p - q - r + pq + qr + pr) - pqr. So if the formula was:

Ratio = 1 - (p + q + r) + (pq + qr + pr) - pqr.

But we get 16/45 = [1 - 2/3 + 1/45 - pqr]

But according to previous steps, in our problem, without pqr term, the ratio was 16/45. Therefore, if the formula is 1 - p - q - r + pq + qr + pr, then indeed 1 - 2/3 + 1/45 = (1 - 2/3) = 1/3 + 1/45 = 16/45. Therefore, this suggests that in the formula, the area ratio is equal to 1 - (p + q + r) + (pq + qr + pr). Therefore, in my earlier calculation, when I came out with 16/45, that is:

1 - (sum p) + (sum pq), however, from the normalized coordinate system computation, the area ratio was computed as 16/45, which in this case p + q + r = 2/3, pq + qr + pr = 1/45, so:

1 - 2/3 + 1/45 = 1/3 + 1/45 = (15 +1)/45 = 16/45, which matches.

So contradiction arises: the formula says 1 - sum p + sum pq, whereas the CEVA-like formula I tried before. Which is better?

But my initial step showed that by going through the coordinates, it ends up as sum pq etc.

Wait, in the step-by-step calculation:

I started with coordinates of each point, D(p,0), E(1 - q, q), F(0,1 - r). Then I computed the area of DEF, which after substituting and using the given values (p + q + r = 2/3 and pq + qr + pr = 1/45), resulted in the area being 16/45 of ABC in that coordinate system.

But in that system, ABC was a right triangle with area 1/2, which when we compute DEF area 8/45, ratio 16/45. So indeed, using coordinates the result gives DEF / ABC = 16/45. Therefore, answer is m/n = 16/45, sum m +n= 61.

But maybe I miscalculated in the coordinate method. Let me check with p = q = r = something.

For example, suppose p = q = r = t, such that 3t = 2/3 => t = 2/9. Then, pq + qr + pr = 3t2 = 3*(4/81) = 12/81 = 4/27. But wait in our given problem, sum p =2/3 and sum pq =1/45. So when they are not equal, but here, in our problem, it's given pq + qr + pr = 1/45.

So let's plug into the formula:

Ratio = 1 - p - q - r + pq + qr + pr = 1 - 2/3 + 1/45 = (1 - 2/3) + 1/45 = 1/3 + 1/45 = 16/45.

This makes sense. Therefore, without the pqr term.

Thus, the answer according to this would be 16/45.

Hence, according to the previous steps and cross-checking, the answer is 16/45, m +n= 16+45=61.

But before I conclude, let me recheck.

The computations in the coordinate system lead to:

Compute DEF area as 8/45 and ABC as 1/2, so 8/45 / (1/2)= 16/45. Yes.

Therefore, answer is 16/45. Just to ensure that Heron's formula was unnecessary here; since we were able to bypass actual areas by normalizing the triangle. Because the affine transformation conserves the area ratio. Therefore, the answer is confirmed.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{61}

<text>First, let me try to visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB = 13, BC = 15, CA = 17. Points D on AB, E on BC, F on CA. The positions of D, E, F are determined by parameters p, q, r respectively. The conditions given are p + q + r = 2/3 and p2 + q2 + r2 = 2/5. These conditions will probably allow me to find cross terms like pq + qr + rp</text>

<text>Wait, maybe I need to recall Routh's theorem.

Routh's theorem states that if on each side of a triangle, a point is chosen such that the cevians divide the sides in ratios r, s, t respectively, then the ratio of the area of the inner triangle to the original triangle is:</text>
<explanation>The solver considers using Routh's theorem as a potential approach, showing the ability to recall and evaluate specialized theorems that might apply to the problem.</explanation>

<start>5109</start>
<end>5493</end>
<text>Wait, in area ratios in affine geometry, ratios are preserved under affine transformations. Since DEF is constructed via points divided proportionally on the sides, affine transformations can take any triangle to another triangle, preserving the ratios. Therefore, maybe I can compute the area ratio in a normalized coordinate system and get the same result as in the given triangle.

That would make sense. Since affine transformations preserve ratios and area ratios, even if the original triangle is scaled or skewed.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates a strategic insight by recognizing that affine transformations preserve area ratios, which allows them to simplify the problem by working in a normalized coordinate system rather than with the original triangle dimensions.</explanation>

<start>5494</start>
<end>5728</end>
<text>Therefore, let me assume triangle ABC is a triangle with coordinates A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0,1). Then compute the coordinates of D, E, F in terms of p, q, r, compute the area of DEF, and then find the ratio.</text>

<text>(p + q + r)2 = (2/3)2 = 4/9

Given that p2 + q2 + r2 = 2/5, then

4/9 = 2/5 + 2(pq + qr + pr)

Therefore,

2(pq + qr + pr) = 4/9 - 2/5</text>

<text>= (20/45 - 18/45) = 2/45

Hence, pq + qr + pr = 1/45</text>

<text>Area of DEF = (1/2)| p*(q - (1 - r)) + (1 - q)*((1 - r) - 0) + 0*(0 - q) |

Simplify:

First Term: p*(q - 1 + r) = p*(q + r - 1)

Second Term: (1 - q)*(1 - r)

Third Term: 0

Thus,

Area DEF = (1/2)| p(q + r -1) + (1 - q)(1 - r) |</text>

Simplify each term:

First term: p(-1/3 -p ) = - (p)/3 - p2

Second term: (1 -2/3) + p + qr = (1/3) + p + qr</text>

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify recurring structures, relationships, or regularities in mathematical expressions or processes, which can lead to insights about the problem structure or solution approach.</definition>

<text>First term inside the brackets: 2p/3

Second term: -p2

Third term: 1/3

Fourth term: 1/45

Fifth term: -p*(2/3 - p) = - (2p/3 - p2) = -2p/3 + p2

Therefore, combining all terms:

2p/3 - p2 + 1/3 + 1/45 -2p/3 + p2

Observe that:

2p/3 -2p/3 cancels out.

-p2 + p2 cancels out.

Leaving 1/3 + 1/45</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes patterns of terms that cancel out in the algebraic expression, which leads to a significant simplification of the area formula. This pattern recognition helps reveal that the final expression is independent of the specific values of p, q, and r individually.</explanation>

<start>9933</start>
<end>10178</end>
<text>Alternatively, according to another source, the area ratio can be computed by S(DEF)/S(ABC) = 1 - (p + q + r) + (pq + qr + rp) - pqr. Wait, let's test this.

If we set p = q = r = t, then:

Ratio = 1 - 3t + 3t2 - t3.

For example, if t = 0, ratio is 1 (correct). If t = 1, ratio = 1 -3 +3 -1 = 0 (correct).</text>
<explanation>The solver tests a potential formula for the area ratio by checking it with specific values (p=q=r=t) and verifying that it produces correct results for known cases (t=0 and t=1), demonstrating pattern recognition in validating mathematical relationships.</explanation>

<start>10484</start>
<end>10730</end>
<text>Compute 1 - 2/3 = 1/3; 1/3 + 1/45 = 15/45 + 1/45 = 16/45.

Therefore, this suggests that in this formula, the Ratio is (1 - p - q - r + pq + qr + pr) - pqr. So if the formula was:

Ratio = 1 - (p + q + r) + (pq + qr + pr) - pqr.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes a pattern in the formula for the area ratio, noting that it follows a structure of 1 minus the sum of the parameters plus the sum of their products minus their triple product.</explanation>

<text>First, let me try to visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB = 13, BC = 15, CA = 17. Points D on AB, E on BC, F on CA.</text>
<explanation>The solver begins by visualizing the geometric configuration of the problem, creating a mental image of the triangle and the points located on its sides.</explanation>

<start>2578</start>
<end>2842</end>
<text>Let me place triangle ABC in the plane, maybe with coordinates. Let me set point A at (0,0), point B at (13,0). Then point C is somewhere in the plane, and distances from A to C is 17, from B to C is 15. Let me compute the coordinates of point C.

Coordinates:

Let me call A(0,0), B(13,0), and C(x,y). Then, AC = 17, so x2 + y2 = 172 = 289

BC = 15, so (x - 13)^2 + y2 = 152 = 225</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates spatial reasoning by placing the triangle in a coordinate system and using the distance formula to set up equations that will determine the coordinates of vertex C.</explanation>

<start>5494</start>
<end>5728</end>
<text>Therefore, let me assume triangle ABC is a triangle with coordinates A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0,1). Then compute the coordinates of D, E, F in terms of p, q, r, compute the area of DEF, and then find the ratio.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses spatial reasoning to place the triangle in a normalized coordinate system, which simplifies the geometric relationships while preserving the area ratio.</explanation>

<start>5729</start>
<end>6173</end>
<text>Given that, as per the problem, AD = p·AB. Here, AB in this coordinate system is from (0,0) to (1,0). So vector AB is (1,0). Therefore, AD = p·AB would take us from A (0,0) by p·AB, resulting in point D(p, 0). Similarly, BE = q·BC. BC is from B(1,0) to C(0,1), vector (-1,1). Then BE is q·BC = (-q, q), so starting at B(1,0), E is at (1 - q, 0 + q) = (1 - q, q). Similarly, CF = r·CA. CA is from C(0,1) to A(0,0), vector (0,-1). So CF = r·CA = (0, -r), so starting at C(0,1), point F is at (0, 1 - r).</text>

<text>since from (p + q + r)2 = p2 + q2 + r2 + 2(pq + qr + rp), I can solve for pq + qr + rp.

Let me compute that first:

(p + q + r)2 = (2/3)2 = 4/9

Given that p2 + q2 + r2 = 2/5, then</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the algebraic identity for expanding (p+q+r)² to establish a relationship between the given conditions and the cross terms they need to find.</explanation>

<start>2347</start>
<end>2577</end>
<text>So, perhaps first, let me compute the area of triangle ABC using Heron's formula. The sides are 13, 15, 17.

The semi-perimeter, s = (13 + 15 + 17)/2 = (45)/2 = 22.5

Area = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = √[22.5*(22.5 - 13)(22.5 - 15)(22.5 - 17)] = √[22.5*9.5*7.5*5.5]</text>

<text>Which is equal to (15/45 + 1/45) = 16/45

Thus, Area DEF = (1/2)(16/45) = 8/45</text>
<explanation>The solver carefully tracks their calculation, combining fractions correctly to arrive at the area of triangle DEF in the normalized coordinate system.</explanation>

<start>8089</start>
<end>8216</end>
<text>Therefore, the ratio of areas DEF to ABC is 8/45.

Wait, hold on. This seems surprisingly clean. But let me verify:</text>
<explanation>The solver pauses to question their result because it seems unexpectedly simple, showing awareness of the need to verify calculations, especially when results appear too convenient.</explanation>

<start>8217</start>
<end>8539</end>
<text>Wait, so in normalized coordinates where ABC has coordinates A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0,1). The area of ABC in this coordinate system is 0.5, since it's a right triangle with base 1 and height 1. But in reality, in our given coordinate system, DEF area was computed as 8/45, and ABC area is 1/2, so the ratio is (8/45) / (1/2) ) = 16/45 ≈ 0.3555...

But this contradicts with the later steps. Wait, actually in the normalized coordinate system, the area of ABC is 1/2.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies a potential contradiction in their reasoning and rechecks their understanding of the areas in the normalized coordinate system, demonstrating careful monitoring of their solution process.</explanation>

<start>10731</start>

<text>But we get 16/45 = [1 - 2/3 + 1/45 - pqr]

But according to previous steps, in our problem, without pqr term, the ratio was 16/45. Therefore, if the formula
