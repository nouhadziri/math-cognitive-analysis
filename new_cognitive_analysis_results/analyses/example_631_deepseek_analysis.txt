Problem:
Find the condition of  $a,b$  for which the function  $f(x)\ (0\leq x\leq 2\pi)$  satisfying the following equality can be determined uniquely,then determine  $f(x)$ , assuming that  $f(x) $  is a continuous function at  $0\leq x\leq 2\pi$ .

\[f(x)=\frac{a}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \sin (x+y)f(y)dy+\frac{b}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \cos (x-y)f(y)dy+\sin x+\cos x\]

Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, let's see. I need to find the conditions on constants a and b such that the function f(x) can be uniquely determined from the given integral equation. Then, I have to find f(x) itself. The equation is:

\[f(x) = \frac{a}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x + y)f(y)dy + \frac{b}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \cos(x - y)f(y)dy + \sin x + \cos x\]

Hmm. Since f(x) is expressed in terms of integrals involving f(y), this looks like a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The general form is:

\[f(x) = \lambda \int_a^b K(x, y)f(y)dy + g(x)\]

Here, the kernel K(x, y) is split into two parts: \(\sin(x + y)\) and \(\cos(x - y)\), and the parameters are a and b instead of a single λ. The nonhomogeneous term is \(\sin x + \cos x\).

I remember that for such equations, if the kernel is separable (i.e., it can be expressed as a finite sum of products of functions of x and y), then the equation can be converted into a system of algebraic equations. Let me check if the kernels here are separable.

First, let's analyze the two integral terms:

1. \(\sin(x + y)\): Using the sine addition formula, this is \(\sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y\). So it's a sum of two separable terms: \(\sin x \cos y\) and \(\cos x \sin y\).

2. \(\cos(x - y)\): Similarly, using the cosine subtraction formula, this is \(\cos x \cos y + \sin x \sin y\). Again, the sum of two separable terms: \(\cos x \cos y\) and \(\sin x \sin y\).

Therefore, both kernels are separable, which is good. That suggests that f(x) can be expressed in terms of a finite combination of sine and cosine functions. Moreover, the nonhomogeneous term is already a combination of sin x and cos x. Therefore, maybe assume that f(x) is of the form:

\[f(x) = A \sin x + B \cos x + C \sin x + D \cos x\]

Wait, actually, let's note that after solving the equation, the solution may involve the same harmonics as the nonhomogeneous term and the kernels. Since the kernels involve sin(x+y) and cos(x-y), which when expanded include sin x, cos x, sin y, and cos y terms. Hence, it's possible that f(x) must be a combination of sin x and cos x. Let me suppose:

\[f(x) = M \sin x + N \cos x\]

Assuming that f(x) is indeed a combination of sin x and cos x. Then, substitute this into the integral equation and see if it can be satisfied, which will lead to equations for M and N in terms of a and b, and then we can find the conditions on a and b for which this system has a unique solution.

Okay, let's proceed step by step. Let me denote f(x) = M sin x + N cos x. Then, substitute into the right-hand side.

First, compute the two integral terms:

1. First integral: \(\frac{a}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x + y) f(y) dy\)

Let's expand sin(x + y) as sin x cos y + cos x sin y. Then,

Integral becomes:

\(\frac{a}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} [sin x cos y + cos x sin y] [M sin y + N cos y] dy\)

Multiply out the terms:

sin x cos y [M sin y + N cos y] + cos x sin y [M sin y + N cos y]

So expanding:

sin x [ M cos y sin y + N cos^2 y ] + cos x [ M sin^2 y + N sin y cos y ]

Therefore, integrating term by term:

First, integrating over y from 0 to 2π.

For the first part: sin x times [ M integral of cos y sin y dy + N integral of cos^2 y dy ]

Similarly, the second part: cos x times [ M integral of sin^2 y dy + N integral of sin y cos y dy ]

Compute each integral:

1. Integral of cos y sin y dy over [0, 2π]:

This is 0.5 integral of sin 2y dy, which is 0.5*(-0.5 cos 2y) from 0 to 2π. Both limits give the same value, so the integral is 0.

2. Integral of cos^2 y dy over [0, 2π]:

Using the identity cos^2 y = 0.5(1 + cos 2y), integral is 0.5*(2π + 0) = π.

3. Integral of sin^2 y dy over [0, 2π]:

Similarly, sin^2 y = 0.5(1 - cos 2y), integral is 0.5*(2π - 0) = π.

4. Integral of sin y cos y dy is the same as the first one, which is 0.

Putting back:

For the first integral term:

sin x [ M*0 + N*π ] + cos x [ M*π + N*0 ] = sin x (N π) + cos x (M π)

Multiply by a/(2π):

[ (a N π)/ (2π) ) sin x + (a M π)/(2π) cos x ] = (a N / 2) sin x + (a M / 2) cos x

Okay, so first integral term simplifies to (a/2)(N sin x + M cos x )

Now, moving to the second integral term:

\(\frac{b}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \cos(x - y) f(y) dy\)

Again, expand cos(x - y) into cos x cos y + sin x sin y. Then,

Integral becomes:

\(\frac{b}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} [cos x cos y + sin x sin y] [M sin y + N cos y] dy\)

Multiply out the terms:

cos x cos y [M sin y + N cos y] + sin x sin y [M sin y + N cos y]

Expanding:

cos x [ M cos y sin y + N cos^2 y ] + sin x [ M sin^2 y + N sin y cos y ]

Integrate term by term over y from 0 to 2π:

First term: cos x [ M integral of cos y sin y dy + N integral of cos^2 y dy ]

Second term: sin x [ M integral of sin^2 y dy + N integral of sin y cos y dy ]

We already computed these integrals above:

Integral of cos y sin y dy = 0; integral of cos^2 y dy = π; integral of sin^2 y dy = π; integral of sin y cos y dy = 0.

Therefore, first term becomes cos x [ 0 + N * π ], second term becomes sin x [ M * π + 0 ]

So the whole integral becomes:

cos x (N π) + sin x (M π)

Multiply by b/(2π):

[ b N π / (2π) ) cos x + b M π / (2π) sin x ] = (b N / 2) cos x + (b M / 2) sin x

Hence, the second integral term is (b/2)(M sin x + N cos x )

So combining both integral terms:

First integral term: (a/2)(N sin x + M cos x )

Second integral term: (b/2)(M sin x + N cos x )

Adding them together:

[ (a N / 2 + b M / 2 ) sin x + (a M / 2 + b N / 2 ) cos x ]

Therefore, the entire equation becomes:

f(x) = [ (a N / 2 + b M / 2 ) sin x + (a M / 2 + b N / 2 ) cos x ] + sin x + cos x

But f(x) was assumed as M sin x + N cos x. Therefore, equate the coefficients:

For sin x:

M = (a N / 2 + b M / 2 ) + 1

For cos x:

N = (a M / 2 + b N / 2 ) + 1

Therefore, we have the system of equations:

M = ( (a N ) / 2 + (b M ) / 2 ) + 1  ...(1)

N = ( (a M ) / 2 + (b N ) / 2 ) + 1  ...(2)

We need to solve this system for M and N, then express conditions on a and b so that this system has a unique solution.

Let me rewrite these equations:

Equation (1):

M - (b/2)M - (a/2)N = 1

Equation (2):

N - (b/2)N - (a/2)M = 1

Factorizing:

M [1 - b/2] - (a/2)N = 1 ...(1a)

N [1 - b/2] - (a/2)M = 1 ...(2a)

This is a linear system:

[1 - b/2   -a/2] [M]   [1

 -a/2    1 - b/2] [N] = [1]

So the coefficient matrix is:

| 1 - b/2    -a/2     |

| -a/2      1 - b/2  |

To solve this system, we can write in matrix form:

Let me denote:

A = 1 - b/2

B = -a/2

Then the matrix is:

[ A    B ]

[ B    A ]

The determinant of this matrix is A^2 - B^2 = (A - B)(A + B)

Compute the determinant:

Det = (1 - b/2)^2 - (-a/2)^2 = (1 - b/2)^2 - (a/2)^2

For the system to have a unique solution, the determinant must be non-zero. Thus, the condition is:

(1 - b/2)^2 - (a/2)^2 ≠ 0

Which can be written as:

[1 - b/2 - a/2][1 - b/2 + a/2] ≠ 0

Therefore, the product of (1 - (a + b)/2) and (1 + (a - b)/2) must not be zero. Therefore, the conditions for uniqueness are:

1 - (a + b)/2 ≠ 0 and 1 + (a - b)/2 ≠ 0

Alternatively, rewritten:

Condition 1: (a + b)/2 ≠ 1 ⇒ a + b ≠ 2

Condition 2: (a - b)/2 ≠ -1 ⇒ a - b ≠ -2

Therefore, combining these, the function f(x) can be determined uniquely if a + b ≠ 2 and a - b ≠ -2.

So that's the condition on a and b. Now, assuming that a and b satisfy these conditions, we can solve the system for M and N.

Let me compute the inverse of the matrix when determinant is non-zero. To solve the system:

A M + B N = 1

B M + A N = 1

Multiplying the first equation by A and the second by B and subtracting?

Wait, actually the standard way for solving this symmetric system.

Let me write the equations again:

(1 - b/2) M - (a/2) N = 1

(-a/2) M + (1 - b/2) N = 1

We can write this as a system:

Equation 1: c M - d N = 1

Equation 2: -d M + c N = 1

where c = 1 - b/2 and d = a/2.

Then, the system can be written as:

c M - d N = 1

-d M + c N = 1

Multiply first equation by c and second by d:

c^2 M - c d N = c

- d^2 M + c d N = d

Add them:

(c^2 - d^2) M = c + d

But determinant is c^2 - d^2. Since determinant ≠ 0, we can solve for M:

M = (c + d)/(c^2 - d^2) = [ (1 - b/2) + (a/2) ] / [ (1 - b/2)^2 - (a/2)^2 ]

Similarly, N can be found by symmetry. Let's note that the equations are symmetric in M and N with the same coefficients. So we can swap M and N and see...

Wait, if we subtract the two equations:

Equation 1: c M - d N = 1

Equation 2: -d M + c N = 1

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

(c M - d N) - (-d M + c N) = 1 - 1 ⇒ (c M + d M) + (-d N - c N) = 0 ⇒ (c + d) M - (c + d) N = 0

Thus, (c + d)(M - N) = 0

So either c + d = 0, which would mean 1 - b/2 + a/2 = 0, or M = N.

But from our determinant condition, determinant Det = c^2 - d^2 = (c - d)(c + d). If the determinant is non-zero, then both (c - d) and (c + d) are non-zero. Therefore, since c + d ≠ 0, then we must have M - N = 0 ⇒ M = N.

So M = N in this case. Therefore, substituting M = N into one of the original equations:

Equation 1: c M - d M = 1 ⇒ (c - d) M = 1 ⇒ M = 1 / (c - d)

Where c = 1 - b/2, d = a/2 ⇒ c - d = 1 - b/2 - a/2. And since the determinant is non-zero, c - d ≠ 0.

Similarly, N = M = 1 / (1 - (a + b)/2 )

Wait, let's see:

c - d = 1 - b/2 - a/2 = 1 - (a + b)/2

Therefore, M = N = 1 / [1 - (a + b)/2]

Alternatively, since M = N, and substitute into the original equations. Let me check:

From Equation 1:

(1 - b/2) M - (a/2) N = (1 - b/2 - a/2 ) M = 1

Therefore, if M = N, then as above, M = 1 / (1 - (a + b)/2 )

Therefore, provided that 1 - (a + b)/2 ≠ 0, which is covered by our previous conditions. Note that our previous determinant condition requires both (1 - (a + b)/2 ) and (1 + (a - b)/2 ) to be non-zero, but when solving we ended up needing only that term for M, but since Det = [1 - (a + b)/2][1 + (a - b)/2 ] ≠ 0, both factors are non-zero, so both of the fractions are non-zero, so that division is safe.

Therefore, M = N = 1 / [1 - (a + b)/2 ]

But wait, is this right? Wait, even though Det is non-zero, which allows M and N to be uniquely determined. However, from M = N, because (c + d)(M - N) = 0 and c + d ≠ 0. Then M = N, so substituting into any equation:

From the first equation:

(1 - b/2) M - (a/2) N = (1 - b/2 - a/2 ) M = 1

Since M = N. Therefore:

M = 1 / (1 - (a + b)/2 )

Therefore, the solution is:

M = N = 1 / (1 - (a + b)/2 )

Which is valid if 1 - (a + b)/2 ≠ 0, which aligns with the determinant condition. However, note determinant is (1 - (a + b)/2)(1 + (a - b)/2 ) ≠ 0, which requires both terms ≠0. Hence, even if 1 - (a + b)/2 is not zero, we still need 1 + (a - b)/2 ≠0 for the determinant to be non-zero. So even though the expression for M and N is in terms of (1 - (a + b)/2 ), the other factor (1 + (a - b)/2 ) must also be non-zero. Thus, even though M and N would be 1/[1 - (a + b)/2 ] regardless, the necessity of determinant ≠0 imposes that both 1 - (a + b)/2 ≠0 and 1 + (a - b)/2 ≠0.

Therefore, I think even though when solving the system, we arrived at M = N = 1 / [1 - (a + b)/2 ], we must confirm that the determinant condition is enforced. That is, even if 1 - (a + b)/2 ≠0, unless 1 + (a - b)/2 ≠0, the determinant would be zero. Therefore, both conditions are required for the uniqueness.

But, perhaps for the existence of M and N, only 1 - (a + b)/2 is needed, but the determinant being non-zero is needed for the system's invertibility, so the matrix determinant must be non-zero, hence, regardless of whether some intermediate step seems to require only one condition, we need both. Thus, summarizing, the determinant is [1 - (a + b)/2][1 + (a - b)/2], so to be non-zero, both factors must be non-zero, which gives: a + b ≠ 2 and a − b ≠ −2.

Therefore, conditions are a + b ≠2 and a − b ≠ −2.

Therefore, given these conditions, then M and N can be solved as:

M = N = 1 / [1 - (a + b)/2 ] = 2 / [2 - a - b ]

So,

f(x) = M sin x + N cos x = [2 / (2 - a - b )] (sin x + cos x )

Therefore, combining this with the inhomogeneous terms. Wait, wait! Wait a second. Let's check:

Hold on, in our substitution, we assumed that f(x) = M sin x + N cos x. Then, after substituting, the integrals yield terms proportional to sin x and cos x, and then adding sin x + cos x. Equate terms:

Thus, equation f(x) = integrals + sin x + cos x

So f(x) must equal the expression we found, which after integration is

(a/2)(N sin x + M cos x ) + (b/2)(M sin x + N cos x ) + sin x + cos x

Then expanding, that combined expression is:

[ (a N /2 + b M /2 ) + 1 ] sin x + [ (a M /2 + b N /2 ) + 1 ] cos x

Therefore, setting coefficients equal to those of f(x), which is M sin x + N cos x, so:

M = (aN /2 + bM /2 ) +1

N = (aM /2 + bN /2 ) +1

As we had. Solving this system leads to M = N = 2/(2 -a - b). So therefore, f(x) = [2/(2 - a - b)] (sin x + cos x )

But wait, why are M and N equal here? Because of the symmetry in the equation? The original equation has symmetries that forced M = N?

Moreover, check if this works. Suppose a + b ≠2 and a - b ≠-2, then f(x) is as above.

Wait, but the inhomogeneous term is sin x + cos x, so we would expect the solution to also have sin x and cos x terms.

Therefore, I think the answer is that when a + b ≠ 2 and a - b ≠ -2, the function f(x) can be uniquely determined as:

f(x) = [2/(2 - a - b)] (sin x + cos x )

Therefore, under the conditions a + b ≠ 2 and a - b ≠ -2, f(x) is given by that expression.

Let me verify this solution once.

Suppose f(x) = [2/(2 - a - b)] (sin x + cos x ). Then, plug into the RHS of the original equation:

First integral term:

(a/(2π)) ∫02π sin(x + y) f(y) dy

f(y) = [2/(2 -a -b)] (sin y + cos y )

Thus,

(a/(2π)) [2/(2 - a - b)] ∫02π sin(x + y)(sin y + cos y) dy

Similarly, second integral term:

(b/(2π)) ∫02π cos(x - y)f(y) dy = (b/(2π)) [2/(2 -a -b)] ∫02π cos(x - y)(sin y + cos y ) dy

Plus sin x + cos x.

Compute these integrals.

First integral:

Compute ∫02π sin(x + y) (sin y + cos y ) dy

Use trig identities. Let's expand sin(x + y):

= ∫ [sin x cos y + cos x sin y] [sin y + cos y] dy

= sin x ∫ [cos y sin y + cos^2 y] dy + cos x ∫ [ sin^2 y + sin y cos y ] dy

We computed these integrals earlier:

For the first part:

sin x [ (0) + π ] + cos x [ π + 0 ] = π (sin x + cos x )

Therefore, first integral evaluates to π ( sin x + cos x )

Multiply by [a/(2π)] [2/(2 - a - b)] :

a/(2π) * 2/(2 - a - b) * π ( sin x + cos x ) = [a/(2 - a - b)] ( sin x + cos x )

Similarly, second integral:

Compute ∫02π cos(x - y)(sin y + cos y ) dy

Expand cos(x - y) as cos x cos y + sin x sin y. So,

= ∫ [ cos x cos y + sin x sin y ] [ sin y + cos y ] dy

= cos x ∫ [ cos y sin y + cos^2 y ] dy + sin x ∫ [ sin^2 y + sin y cos y ] dy

Again, integrating term by term:

First integral:

cos x [0 + π ] + sin x [ π + 0 ] = π ( cos x + sin x )

Therefore, the second integral evaluates to π ( sin x + cos x )

Multiply by [ b/(2π ) ] [ 2/(2 - a - b ) ] :

b/(2π ) * 2/(2 - a - b ) * π ( sin x + cos x ) = [b/(2 - a - b ) ] ( sin x + cos x )

Therefore, the entire RHS becomes:

[ a/(2 - a - b ) + b/(2 - a - b ) ] ( sin x + cos x ) + sin x + cos x

= [ (a + b)/(2 - a - b ) ] ( sin x + cos x ) + sin x + cos x

Factor out sin x + cos x:

[ (a + b)/(2 - a - b ) + 1 ] ( sin x + cos x )

Compute the bracket:

= [ (a + b + 2 - a - b ) / (2 - a - b ) ] ( sin x + cos x )

Numerator simplifies to (2)/(2 - a - b )

Therefore, overall:

[ 2 / (2 - a - b ) ] ( sin x + cos x ) = f(x)

Which matches our solution, as desired.

Thus, the solution is correct. Therefore, f(x) = 2/(2 -a - b )( sin x + cos x ), provided that 2 -a - b ≠0 i.e., a + b ≠2, and also a - b ≠-2 (due to determinant), but must confirm how that affects.

Wait, but in the previous steps, we needed determinant ≠0 for the system to be solvable uniquely, and determinant is (2 - a - b)(2 - a + b ) /4? Wait no.

Wait earlier when we expressed the determinant:

The original determinant after substitution was:

(1 - b/2)^2 - (a/2)^2

= 1 - b + (b2)/4 - a2/4

= 1 - b - a2/4 + b2/4

But how does this factor?

Alternatively,

(1 - b/2 - a/2)(1 - b/2 + a/2 ) )

Yes:

( c - d )( c + d ) = (1 - b/2 -a/2)(1 - b/2 + a/2 )

Hence, Det = (1 - (a + b)/2 )(1 + (a - b)/2 )

Thus  to be ≠0, both factors must be non-zero, hence 1 - (a + b)/2 ≠0 and 1 + (a - b)/2 ≠0 which are:

a + b ≠2 and a - b ≠ -2.

Therefore, even though in the evaluation of f(x) using substitution gave that the coefficient is 2/(2 -a - b ), that expression is valid only under both conditions, since when the determinant is zero, the system either has infinitely many solutions or none. Since the system here with the inhomogeneous term (1,1), exists if determinant ≠0 as the system has unique solution. However, if determinant is zero, there might be either no solution or infinitely many.

But per the problem statement, they are asking for the condition when the function can be determined uniquely. Therefore, the conditions are that a + b ≠2 and a - b ≠-2.

Therefore, final answer: the conditions are a + b ≠2 and a - b ≠-2, and f(x)= [2/(2 -a - b ) ] ( sin x +cosx )

But according to problem statement, f(x) is continuous on [0,2π], which it is as it's a combination of sine and cosine. The continuous condition is already satisfied.

Hence, concluding:

Conditions: a + b ≠ 2 and a - b ≠ -2.

Function: f(x) = \frac{2}{2 - a - b} (\sin x + \cos x )

**Final Answer**
The conditions are \(a + b \neq 2\) and \(a - b \neq -2\), and the function is uniquely determined as \(\boxed{f(x) = \dfrac{2(\sin x + \cos x)}{2 - a - b}}\).

<explanation>The solver rearranges the equations to create a standard linear system, demonstrating skill in algebraic manipulation to transform the problem into a more tractable form.</explanation>

<start>4783</start>
<end>5050</end>
<text>The determinant of this matrix is A^2 - B^2 = (A - B)(A + B)

Compute the determinant:

Det = (1 - b/2)^2 - (-a/2)^2 = (1 - b/2)^2 - (a/2)^2

For the system to have a unique solution, the determinant must be non-zero. Thus, the condition is:

(1 - b/2)^2 - (a/2)^2 ≠ 0</text>
<explanation>The solver computes the determinant of the coefficient matrix and factors the expression to establish conditions for uniqueness, showing proficiency in algebraic manipulation techniques.</explanation>

<start>5051</start>
<end>5196</end>
<text>Which can be written as:

[1 - b/2 - a/2][1 - b/2 + a/2] ≠ 0

Therefore, the product of (1 - (a + b)/2) and (1 + (a - b)/2) must not be zero.</text>
<explanation>The solver continues the algebraic manipulation by factoring the determinant expression into a product, which directly leads to the conditions for uniqueness.</explanation>

<skill>Verification and Checking</skill>
<definition>Validating solutions by substituting back into original equations, checking against known constraints, or using alternative methods to confirm correctness.</definition>

<start>9766</start>
<end>9844</end>
<text>Let me verify this solution once.

Suppose f(x) = [2/(2 - a - b)] (sin x + cos x ).</text>
<explanation>The solver explicitly states the intention to verify the solution, demonstrating awareness of the importance of checking work.</explanation>

<start>9845</start>
<end>10914</end>
<text>Then, plug into the RHS of the original equation:

First integral term:

(a/(2π)) ∫02π sin(x + y) f(y) dy

f(y) = [2/(2 -a -b)] (sin y + cos y )

Thus,

(a/(2π)) [2/(2 - a - b)] ∫02π sin(x + y)(sin y + cos y) dy

Similarly, second integral term:

(b/(2π)) ∫02π cos(x - y)f(y) dy = (b/(2π)) [2/(2 -a -b)] ∫02π cos(x - y)(sin y + cos y ) dy

Plus sin x + cos x.

Compute these integrals.

First integral:

Compute ∫02π sin(x + y) (sin y + cos y ) dy

Use trig identities. Let's expand sin(x + y):

= ∫ [sin x cos y + cos x sin y] [sin y + cos y] dy

= sin x ∫ [cos y sin y + cos^2 y] dy + cos x ∫ [ sin^2 y + sin y cos y ] dy</text>
<explanation>The solver systematically substitutes the proposed solution back into the original equation and works through the calculations step-by-step to verify that it satisfies the equation.</explanation>

<start>11695</start>
<end>11939</end>
<text>Therefore, the entire RHS becomes:

[ a/(2 - a - b ) + b/(2 - a - b ) ] ( sin x + cos x ) + sin x + cos x

= [ (a + b)/(2 - a - b ) ] ( sin x + cos x ) + sin x + cos x

Factor out sin x + cos x:</text>
<explanation>The solver combines terms from the verification calculation and factors the expression to compare with the proposed form of f(x), showing careful attention to verification.</explanation>

<start>12082</start>
<end>12203</end>
<text>Therefore, overall:

[ 2 / (2 - a - b ) ] ( sin x + cos x ) = f(x)

Which matches our solution, as desired.</text>
<explanation>The solver completes the verification by confirming that the calculated result matches the proposed solution, demonstrating thoroughness in the verification process.</explanation>

<skill>Metacognitive Monitoring</skill>
<definition>Actively monitoring one's own thinking process, identifying errors or inconsistencies, and adjusting strategies accordingly during problem-solving.</definition>

<start>1797</start>
<end>1850</end>
<text>Wait, actually, let's note that after solving the equation, the solution</text>
<explanation>The solver interrupts their own line of reasoning to reconsider their approach, showing awareness of their thinking process and willingness to adjust.</explanation>

<start>6732</start>
<end>6823</end>
<text>But wait, is this right? Wait, even though Det is non-zero, which allows M and N to be uniquely determined.</text>
<explanation>The solver questions their own reasoning and pauses to reconsider whether their approach is correct, demonstrating metacognitive monitoring.</explanation>

<start>9766</start>
<end>9787</end>
<text>Let me verify this solution once.</text>
<explanation>The solver explicitly decides to verify their solution, showing awareness of the importance of checking work and the possibility of errors.</explanation>

<start>12204</start>
<end>12331</end>
<text>Thus, the solution is correct. Therefore, f(x) = 2/(2 -a - b )( sin x + cos x ), provided that 2 -a - b ≠0 i.e., a + b ≠2, and also a - b ≠-2</text>
<explanation>After verification, the solver confirms the correctness of their solution while also reiterating the necessary conditions, showing careful monitoring of the solution process.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Reasoning</skill>
<definition>Using logical deduction, inference, and mathematical principles to draw conclusions, make predictions, or justify steps in a solution.</definition>

<start>5197</start>
<end>5363</end>
<text>Therefore, the conditions for uniqueness are:

1 - (a + b)/2 ≠ 0 and 1 + (a - b)/2 ≠ 0

Alternatively, rewritten:

Condition 1: (a + b)/2 ≠ 1 ⇒ a + b ≠ 2

Condition 2: (a - b)/2 ≠ -1 ⇒ a - b ≠ -2</text>
<explanation>The solver derives the conditions for uniqueness by analyzing when the determinant is non-zero, demonstrating logical reasoning to translate mathematical conditions into constraints on the parameters a and b.</explanation>

<start>6824</start>
<end>7262</end>
<text>However, from M = N, because (c + d)(M - N) = 0 and c + d ≠ 0. Then M = N, so substituting into any equation:

From the first equation:

(1 - b/2) M - (a/2) N = (1 - b/2 - a/2 ) M = 1

Since M = N. Therefore:

M = 1 / (1 - (a + b)/2 )

Therefore, the solution is:

M = N = 1 / (1 - (a + b)/2 )</text>
<explanation>The solver uses logical reasoning to deduce that M = N based on the structure of the equations, then substitutes this insight back into the original system to find explicit expressions for M and N.</explanation>

<start>7263</start>
<end>7873</end>
<text>Which is valid if 1 - (a + b)/2 ≠ 0, which aligns with the determinant condition. However, note determinant is (1 - (a + b)/2)(1 + (a - b)/2 ) ≠ 0, which requires both terms ≠0. Hence, even if 1 - (a + b)/2 is not zero, we still need 1 + (a - b)/2 ≠0 for the determinant to be non-zero. So even though the expression for M and N is in terms of (1 - (a + b)/2 ), the other factor (1 + (a - b)/2 ) must also be non-zero. Thus, even though M and N would be 1/[1 - (a + b)/2 ] regardless, the necessity of determinant ≠0 imposes that both 1 - (a + b)/2 ≠0 and 1 + (a - b)/2 ≠0.</text>
<explanation>The solver carefully reasons about the relationship between the expression for M and N and the conditions required for uniqueness, showing deep mathematical reasoning about the structure of the solution.</explanation>
