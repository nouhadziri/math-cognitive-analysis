Problem:
If r(t) = (6t+2)i + 5t^2j - 8tk, find the Binormal vector as [xi, yj, zk]. What are x, y, z? Return them as a list.

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to find the Binormal vector for the given vector function r(t) = (6t + 2)i + 5t2j - 8tk. Hmm, okay, the Binormal vector is part of the Frenet-Serret formulas, right? From what I remember, the Binormal vector B is defined as the cross product of the unit tangent vector T and the unit normal vector N. So, B = T × N. 

But to get there, I probably need to first find the tangent vector T, then the normal vector N, and then take their cross product. Let me see... The unit tangent vector T is the derivative of r(t) divided by its magnitude. Then the unit normal vector N is the derivative of T divided by its magnitude. Once I have those, I can cross them to get B. Then the Binormal vector's components should be the x, y, z they're asking about.

Let me start by finding the derivative of r(t). The vector function r(t) has components x(t) = 6t + 2, y(t) = 5t2, and z(t) = -8t. So, the velocity vector v(t) = r'(t) is the derivative of each component. Let's compute that.

dx/dt = 6, dy/dt = 10t, dz/dt = -8. So, r'(t) = 6i + 10t j -8k. That's the tangent vector, but not necessarily the unit tangent vector. To get T, we need to divide r'(t) by its magnitude. 

First, compute the magnitude of r'(t), which is ||r'(t)|| = sqrt((6)^2 + (10t)^2 + (-8)^2). Let's calculate that. 6 squared is 36, (10t)^2 is 100t2, and (-8)^2 is 64. So, ||r'(t)|| = sqrt(36 + 100t2 + 64) = sqrt(100t2 + 100). Factor out 100: sqrt(100(t2 + 1)) = 10*sqrt(t2 + 1).

Therefore, the unit tangent vector T(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)|| = (6i + 10t j -8k) / (10*sqrt(t2 +1)) = [6/(10*sqrt(t2+1))]i + [10t/(10*sqrt(t2+1))]j + [-8/(10*sqrt(t2+1))]k.

Simplifying each component, we get:

T(t) = (3/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)))i + (t / sqrt(t2 +1))j - (4/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)))k.

Alright, step one done. Now need to find the unit normal vector N(t). For that, we need the derivative of T(t) with respect to t, and then divide by its magnitude.

So, let's compute T'(t). This might be a bit tricky because of the square roots and the variables in the denominator.

Let me write T(t) as:

T(t) = 3/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)) i + t/(sqrt(t2 +1)) j -4/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)) k.

Let's differentiate each component separately.

Starting with the i-component: 3/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)).

Let me denote the i-component as f(t) = 3/(5*(t2 +1)^(1/2)).

To find f'(t), we can apply the chain rule. The derivative of (t2 +1)^(-1/2) is (-1/2)*(t2 +1)^(-3/2)*2t = -t/(t2 +1)^(3/2). Multiply by 3/5: f'(t) = 3/5 * (-t/(t2 +1)^(3/2)) )= -3t/(5*(t2 +1)^(3/2)).

Now, the j-component of T(t) is t/(sqrt(t2 +1)).

Let me denote this as g(t) = t*(t2 +1)^(-1/2).

Using the product rule: g'(t) = derivative of t * (t2 +1)^(-1/2) + t * derivative of (t2 +1)^(-1/2).

Compute derivative of t is 1, so first term: 1 * (t2 +1)^(-1/2).

Second term: t * [(-1/2)(t2 +1)^(-3/2)*2t] = t * (-t)/(t2 +1)^(3/2) = -t2/(t2 +1)^(3/2).

Therefore, g'(t) = (t2 +1)^(-1/2) - t2/(t2 +1)^(3/2).

Factor out (t2 +1)^(-3/2): first term is (t2 +1)^(-1/2) = (t2 +1)/ (t2 +1)^(3/2) = (t2 +1)/(t2 +1)^(3/2) = 1/(t2 +1)^(1/2). Wait, perhaps better to combine the terms:

We can write (t2 +1)^(-1/2) - t2/(t2 +1)^(3/2) = [ (t2 +1) - t2 ] / (t2 +1)^(3/2) ) = [1]/(t2 +1)^(3/2).

So, g'(t) = 1/(t2 +1)^(3/2).

Hmm, that's a neat simplification. So, the derivative of the j-component is 1/(t2 +1)^(3/2).

Now, the k-component of T(t) is -4/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)).

Similar to the i-component. Let's denote this as h(t) = -4/(5)*(t2 +1)^(-1/2). The derivative h'(t) = -4/5*(-1/2)*(t2 +1)^(-3/2)*2t. 

Simplifying, -4/5 * (-1/2)*2t/(t2 +1)^(3/2) = (-4/5)*(-t/(t2 +1)^(3/2)) = 4t/(5*(t2 +1)^(3/2)).

Alright, putting all these derivatives together, T'(t) is:

-3t/(5*(t2 +1)^(3/2)) i + 1/(t2 +1)^(3/2) j + 4t/(5*(t2 +1)^(3/2)) k.

Now, factor out the common term 1/(t2 +1)^(3/2). So:

T'(t) = [ -3t/5 i + 1*j + 4t/5 k ] * (1)/(t2 +1)^(3/2).

Therefore, the vector inside the brackets is (-3t/5)i + j + (4t/5)k.

To find the magnitude of T'(t), since scaling by 1/(t2 +1)^(3/2), the magnitude of T'(t) is the magnitude of the vector (-3t/5, 1, 4t/5) multiplied by 1/(t2 +1)^(3/2).

Compute ||T'(t)|| = ||(-3t/5, 1, 4t/5)|| * 1/(t2 +1)^(3/2)).

First, compute the magnitude of vector (-3t/5, 1, 4t/5):

sqrt[ (-3t/5)^2 + (1)^2 + (4t/5)^2 ] = sqrt[ (9t2)/25 + 1 + (16t2)/25 ]

Combine terms: (9t2 + 16t2)/25 +1 = (25t2)/25 +1 = t2 +1.

Therefore, the magnitude of (-3t/5,1,4t/5) is sqrt(t2 +1). Therefore, ||T'(t)|| = sqrt(t2 +1) * 1/(t2 +1)^(3/2) ) = 1/(t2 +1).

Therefore, the unit normal vector N(t) = T'(t)/||T'(t)|| = [ (-3t/5)i + j +4t/5k ] * (1/(t2 +1)^(3/2)) / (1/(t2 +1)) ) = [ (-3t/5)i + j +4t/5k ] * 1/(sqrt(t2 +1)).

Hence, N(t) = [ (-3t/5)/(sqrt(t2 +1)) )i + 1/(sqrt(t2 +1))j + (4t/5)/(sqrt(t2 +1))k ].

Simplify each component:

N(t) = ( -3t / [5*sqrt(t2 +1)] )i + (1 / sqrt(t2 +1))j + (4t / [5*sqrt(t2 +1)] )k.

Okay, so now we have both T(t) and N(t). Now, the Binormal vector is the cross product B = T × N.

But to compute the cross product, it's perhaps easier to compute using their components.

Let me note that T and N are both unit vectors, hence their cross product will be a unit vector as well. However, perhaps when we compute the cross product we need not normalize again, but since we are using the actual T and N, their cross product magnitude should be 1? Wait, actually, no. The cross product of two unit vectors is not necessarily a unit vector. Its magnitude is equal to the sine of the angle between them. But in the Frenet-Serret frame, since T and N are orthogonal, their cross product should be a unit vector. Right? Since T and N are perpendicular, right? Because the normal vector is the derivative of T with respect to arc length, and is orthogonal to T. So T and N are orthogonal unit vectors, hence their cross product should be a unit vector. Therefore, B is automatically a unit vector, so we don't have to normalize it again. That's convenient.

So, to compute B = T × N, in components. Let me write out the components of T and N.

T(t):

i-component: 3/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)),

j-component: t/sqrt(t2 +1),

k-component: -4/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)).

N(t):

i-component: -3t/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)),

j-component: 1/sqrt(t2 +1),

k-component: 4t/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)).

To take the cross product T × N, we can set up the determinant with the unit vectors i, j, k in the first row, the components of T in the second row, and components of N in the third row.

Let me arrange this:

| i          j            k          |
| T_i       T_j         T_k |
| N_i       N_j         N_k |

Which is:

| i          j                  k          |
| 3/(5√(t2+1))  t/√(t2+1)  -4/(5√(t2+1)) |
| -3t/(5√(t2+1)) 1/√(t2+1)  4t/(5√(t2+1)) |

So, let's compute the determinant.

The cross product will be:

i [ T_j*N_k - T_k*N_j ] - j [ T_i*N_k - T_k*N_i ] + k [ T_i*N_j - T_j*N_i ]

Let me compute each component step by step.

First, the i-component:

T_j*N_k - T_k*N_j

T_j = t / sqrt(t2 +1),

N_k = 4t/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)),

T_k = -4/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)),

N_j =1 / sqrt(t2 +1)

So,

T_j*N_k = [t / sqrt(t2 +1)] * [4t/(5*sqrt(t2 +1))] = (4t2)/(5(t2 +1))

T_k*N_j = [-4/(5*sqrt(t2 +1))] * [1 / sqrt(t2 +1)] = -4/(5(t2 +1))

So,

T_j*N_k - T_k*N_j = (4t2)/(5(t2 +1)) - (-4)/(5(t2 +1)) = [4t2 +4]/[5(t2 +1)] = 4(t2 +1)/[5(t2 +1)] = 4/5

So the i-component is 4/5.

Next, the j-component. But note that in the cross product formula, it's subtracted. So, - [ T_i*N_k - T_k*N_i ]

Compute T_i*N_k - T_k*N_i:

T_i =3/(5*sqrt(t2 +1))

N_k =4t/(5*sqrt(t2 +1))

T_i*N_k = 3/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)) *4t/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)) = (12t)/(25(t2 +1))

T_k = -4/(5*sqrt(t2 +1))

N_i = -3t/(5*sqrt(t2 +1))

T_k*N_i = (-4/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)))* (-3t/(5*sqrt(t2 +1))) = (12t)/(25(t2 +1))

So,

T_i*N_k - T_k*N_i = (12t)/(25(t2 +1)) - (12t)/(25(t2 +1)) = 0

Hence, the j-component is -0 = 0.

Finally, the k-component:

T_i*N_j - T_j*N_i

T_i =3/(5*sqrt(t2 +1))

N_j =1 /sqrt(t2 +1)

T_i*N_j =3/(5*sqrt(t2 +1)) *1/sqrt(t2 +1) =3/(5(t2 +1))

T_j =t / sqrt(t2 +1)

N_i =-3t/(5*sqrt(t2 +1))

T_j*N_i = [t / sqrt(t2 +1)] * [-3t/(5*sqrt(t2 +1))] = (-3t2)/(5(t2 +1))

So,

T_i*N_j - T_j*N_i = 3/(5(t2 +1)) - (-3t2)/(5(t2 +1)) = [3 + 3t2]/[5(t2 +1)] = 3(t2 +1)/[5(t2 +1)] = 3/5.

Therefore, the k-component is 3/5.

Therefore, the cross product B = T × N equals (4/5)i + 0j + (3/5)k.

So, the Binormal vector B is (4/5)i + (3/5)k. Thus, as a vector, it's [4/5, 0, 3/5].

Therefore, the components are x = 4/5, y = 0, z = 3/5.

Wait, but let me just double-check the signs. Because when computing cross products, the signs depend on the order. Since B is T × N, and i component was T_j N_k - T_k N_j. The calculation:

T_j N_k was positive and T_k N_j was negative, leading to 4/5 positive. Similarly, the k-component was T_i N_j - T_j N_i. Which turned out to be 3(t2 +1)/5(t2 +1) = 3/5 positive.

So indeed, the Binormal vector has components (4/5, 0, 3/5). Therefore, the answer is [4/5, 0, 3/5]. Therefore, x = 4/5, y = 0, z = 3/5.

But wait, let me think—Did I compute the cross product correctly?

Given T and N components, which are:

T = [3/(5S), t/S, -4/(5S)] where S = sqrt(t2 +1)

N = [-3t/(5S), 1/S, 4t/(5S)]

So cross product of T and N would be determinant as follows:

i component: T_j * N_k - T_k * N_j = (t/S)(4t/(5S)) - (-4/(5S))(1/S) = (4t2)/(5S2) + 4/(5S2) = (4t2 +4)/(5S2) = 4(t2 +1)/(5(t2 +1)) ) = 4/5.

Yes. Then the j component: -(T_i * N_k - T_k * N_i ) = - [ (3/(5S))(4t/(5S)) - (-4/(5S))(-3t/(5S)) ) ]

Wait, so let me recheck:

T_i * N_k = 3/(5S) *4t/(5S) =12t/(25 S2)

T_k *N_i= (-4/(5S)) *(-3t/(5S))= 12 t/(25 S2)

Thus, T_i * N_k - T_k *N_i =12t/(25 S2 ) - 12t/(25 S2)=0, so the whole term is zero, as calculated before.

Then the k component:

T_i * N_j - T_j *N_i =3/(5S) *1/S - t/S*(-3t/(5S)) =3/(5 S2) +3t2/(5 S2) =3(1 +t2)/(5 S2) =3(t2 +1)/(5(t2 +1)) )=3/5. Since S2 = t2 +1.

Therefore, yes. So B is indeed (4/5)i +0j +3/5k. So components are x=4/5, y=0, z=3/5. Thus, returning these as a list would be [4/5, 0, 3/5]. Let me check once more, perhaps when I calculated S2 etc., but t2 +1 term cancels out. All steps seem correct.

Alternatively, noticing that T and N are in TNB frame with B = T×N. We can recall that in general for a helix, the Binormal vector is constant, but since here the problem gives a general vector function which might not be a helix. Wait, but in this case, even for non-helix, the Binormal is calculated as T×N, so the steps are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for B without computing T and N. Another way is to use B = (r' × r'') / ||r' × r''||. Wait, but is that true?

Wait, yes, the Binormal vector can also be calculated as (r' × r'') divided by its magnitude, correct? Let me recall.

Since T is r'/||r'||, then T' = dT/ds, where s is the arc length, and N = T'/||T'||.

Then, B = T × N. However, in terms of the derivatives of r(t), we can also express B as (r' × r'') / ||r' × r''||.

Let me confirm. The cross product r' × r'' is related to the binormal vector. Specifically, B is parallel to r' × r'', because Binormal is perpendicular to both T and N, hence in the direction of r' × r''. But the magnitude needs to be adjusted.

Wait, here's the fact: the direction of the Binormal vector is given by r' × r''. Specifically, since T is in the direction of r', and the normal is in the direction of derivative of T, hence, but perhaps more concretely:

If we compute B as the cross product of T and N, and T = r'/||r'||, then N is T' / ||T'||. So, perhaps using this would take time.

Alternatively, another formula:

The torsion τ is given by (r' × r'') ⋅ r''' over ||r' × r''|| squared. But in this case, it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps in some references, the Binormal vector B can be computed as (r' × r'') / ||r' × r''||. Wait, but let's check:

If B is T × N, and T = r'/||r'||, and N = (T')/||T'|| then,

First, express T' = ||r'||(r'' ) - (r' ⋅ r'' )r' / ||r'||3. Hold on, this might not be helpful here.

But given that we already have the derivation done by first principle and arrived at B = [4/5,0,3/5], maybe it's better to check via another method.

Wait, let's compute r' × r'' and see.

Given that r'(t) =6i +10t j -8k

Compute r''(t)= derivative of r': 0i +10j +0k= 10j

Thus, compute r' × r'' is determinant:

|i  j   k|
|6 10t -8|
|0 10   0|

Compute this determinant:

i*(10t*0 - (-8)*10) - j*(6*0 - (-8)*0) + k*(6*10 - 10t*0)

Simplify:

i*(0 +80) - j*(0 -0)+ k*(60 -0)= 80i +0j +60k=80i +60k

Therefore, r' × r''=80i +60k. So ||r' × r''||= sqrt(802 +602)=sqrt(6400 + 3600)=sqrt(10000)=100. Therefore, (r' × r'')/||r' × r''|| is (80i +60k)/100= (4/5 i + 3/5 k), which matches our earlier result for B.

Therefore, regardless of the method, the Binormal vector here is indeed 4/5 i +0j +3/5k, so components are [4/5,0,3/5].

Wow, that cross-check via r' × r'' was faster. So, to sanity check, the Binormal vector is in the direction of r' × r'' normalized. Since in our first method we calculated T and N and then cross producted, arriving at B = [4/5,0,3/5]. The second method gave the same, so that's a good check.

So, the final answer is x=4/5, y=0, z=3/5. So the list is [4/5, 0, 3/5].

**Final Answer**
The components of the Binormal vector are \boxed{\left[\dfrac{4}{5}, 0, \dfrac{3}{5}\right]}.

<explanation>The solver considers alternative approaches to the problem, showing flexibility in thinking and knowledge of multiple solution methods. They evaluate whether a simpler formula could be applied directly instead of going through the more complex T and N calculations.</explanation>

<text>Given T and N components, which are:

T = [3/(5S), t/S, -4/(5S)] where S = sqrt(t2 +1)

N = [-3t/(5S), 1/S, 4t/(5S)]

So cross product of T and N would be determinant as follows:

i component: T_j * N_k - T_k * N_j = (t/S)(4t/(5S)) - (-4/(5S))(1/S) = (4t2)/(5S2) + 4/(5S2) = (4t2 +4)/(5S2) = 4(t2 +1)/(5(t2 +1)) ) = 4/5.</text>
<explanation>The solver rechecks their work using a different representation (using S as a shorthand for sqrt(t²+1)), demonstrating flexibility in notation and approach to verify the solution.</explanation>

<text>We can write (t2 +1)^(-1/2) - t2/(t2 +1)^(3/2) = [ (t2 +1) - t2 ] / (t2 +1)^(3/2) ) = [1]/(t2 +1)^(3/2).

So, g'(t) = 1/(t2 +1)^(3/2).

Hmm, that's a neat simplification. So, the derivative of the j-component is 1/(t2 +1)^(3/2).</text>
<explanation>The solver simplifies a complex expression by finding a common denominator and combining terms, recognizing that (t²+1)-t² = 1. This demonstrates algebraic manipulation skills and appreciation for elegant mathematical simplifications.</explanation>

<start>5117</start>
<end>5380</end>
<text>To find the magnitude of T'(t), since scaling by 1/(t2 +1)^(3/2), the magnitude of T'(t) is the magnitude of the vector (-3t/5, 1, 4t/5) multiplied by 1/(t2 +1)^(3/2).

Compute ||T'(t)|| = ||(-3t/5, 1, 4t/5)|| * 1/(t2 +1)^(3/2)).</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that the magnitude calculation can be simplified by factoring out the scalar term 1/(t²+1)^(3/2), showing understanding of vector norm properties and efficient calculation techniques.</explanation>

<start>5381</start>
<end>5617</end>
<text>First, compute the magnitude of vector (-3t/5, 1, 4t/5):

sqrt[ (-3t/5)^2 + (1)^2 + (4t/5)^2 ] = sqrt[ (9t2)/25 + 1 + (16t2)/25 ]

Combine terms: (9t2 + 16t2)/25 +1 = (25t2)/25 +1 = t2 +1.</text>
<explanation>The solver performs algebraic simplification of the vector magnitude calculation, recognizing that 9t²/25 + 16t²/25 = 25t²/25 = t². This demonstrates pattern recognition and efficient algebraic manipulation.</explanation>

<text>Let me note that T and N are both unit vectors, hence their cross product will be a unit vector as well. However, perhaps when we compute the cross product we need not normalize again, but since we are using the actual T and N, their cross product magnitude should be 1? Wait, actually, no. The cross product of two unit vectors is not necessarily a unit vector. Its magnitude is equal to the sine of the angle between them. But in the Frenet-Serret frame, since T and N are orthogonal, their cross product should be a unit vector.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates geometric understanding of cross products, specifically that the magnitude of a cross product depends on the sine of the angle between vectors. They correctly reason that since T and N are orthogonal unit vectors in the Frenet-Serret frame, their cross product will be a unit vector.</explanation>

<start>6601</start>
<end>6826</end>
<text>Right? Since T and N are perpendicular, right? Because the normal vector is the derivative of T with respect to arc length, and is orthogonal to T. So T and N are orthogonal unit vectors, hence their cross product should be a unit vector.</text>
<explanation>The solver shows understanding of the geometric relationship between the tangent and normal vectors in the Frenet-Serret frame, specifically that they are orthogonal by definition because the normal vector is derived from the derivative of T with respect to arc length.</explanation>
