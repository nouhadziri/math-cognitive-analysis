Problem:
Let $S=\{1,2, \ldots, 20\}$, and let $f$ be a function from $S$ to $S$; that is, for all $s \in S, f(s) \in S$. Define the sequence $s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, \ldots$ by setting $s_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{20} \underbrace{(f \circ \cdots \circ f)}_{n}(k)$. That is, $s_{1}=f(1)+$ $\cdots+f(20), s_{2}=f(f(1))+\cdots+f(f(20)), s_{3}=f(f(f(1)))+f(f(f(2)))+\cdots+f(f(f(20)))$, etc. Compute the smallest integer $p$ such that the following statement is true: The sequence $s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, \ldots$ must be periodic after a certain point, and its period is at most $p$. (If the sequence is never periodic, then write $\infty$ as your answer.)

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
If $f$ is simply a permutation of $S$, then $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$ is periodic. To understand why, consider a smaller set $T=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$. If $f:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,7,8,6,9,10]$, then $f$ has one cycle of period 5 and one cycle of period 3 , so the period of $f$ is 15 . However,

$$
f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)+f(5)+f(6)+f(7)+f(8)+f(9)+f(10)=
$$



$$
2+3+4+5+1+7+8+6+9+10=55,
$$

because $f$ just rearranges the order of the summands. So $s_{1}=s_{0}$, and for all $n, s_{n}=s_{n+1}$; in short, the period of $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$ is just 1 .

In order for $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$ to have a period greater than $1, f$ must be many-to-one, so that some values occur more than once (and some values do not occur at all) in the sum $f(1)+f(2)+\cdots+f(10)$ (or, in the original problem, $f(1)+f(2)+\cdots+f(20)$ ). For example, consider the function $f_{2}$ below:

$$
f_{2}:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]
$$

Note that $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+1+10+9+10+7+3 \neq 55$, so $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$ is not immediately periodic. But $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$ is eventually periodic, as the following argument shows. The function $f_{2}$ has two cycles: $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 1$, and $7 \rightarrow 9 \rightarrow 7$. There are also two paths that meet up with the first cycle: $6 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow \cdots$ and $8 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow \cdots$. Thus for all $k$ in $T, f_{2}\left(f_{2}(k)\right)$ is an element of one of these two extended cycles. Thus $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$ eventually becomes periodic.

The criterion that the function be many-to-one is necessary, but not sufficient, for $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$ to have period greater than 1 . To see why, consider the function $g:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \rightarrow$ $[2,3,4,5,6,1,8,7,8,7]$. This function is many-to-one, and contains two cycles, $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow$ $3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 1$ and $7 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 7$. But because $g(9)=8$ and $g(10)=7$, the sum $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+6+1+8+7+8+7$, while $s_{2}=3+4+5+6+1+2+7+8+7+8$. In fact, for $n>1, s_{n+1}=s_{n}$, because applying $f$ only permutes the 6 -cycle and switches the two 7 's and two 8's. That is, in the list $\underbrace{(g \circ \cdots \circ g)}_{n}(1), \ldots, \underbrace{(g \circ \cdots \circ g)}_{n}(10)$, the values 7 and 8 both show up exactly twice. This cycle is balanced: each of its elements shows up the same number of times for all $n$ in the list $\underbrace{(g \circ \cdots \circ g)}_{n}(1), \ldots, \underbrace{(g \circ \cdots \circ g)}_{n}(10)$, for all $n$ after a certain point. The conclusion is that not all many-to-one functions produce unbalanced cycles.

There are two ways a function $g$ can produce balanced cycles. First, the cycles can be selfcontained, so no element outside of the cycle is ever absorbed into the cycle, as happens with the 6-cycle in the example above. Alternatively, the outside elements that are absorbed into a cycle can all arrive at different points of the cycle, so that each element of the cycle occurs equally often in each iteration of $g$. In the example above, the values $g(9)=7$ and $g(10)=8$ balance the $7 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 7$ cycle. On the other hand, in the function $f_{2}$ above, $f(f(6))=f(f(8))=f(f(1))=3$, making the large cycle unbalanced: in $s_{2}$, the value 3 appears three times in $s_{2}$, but the value 2 only appears once in $s_{2}$.

The foregoing shows that only unbalanced cycles can affect the periodicity of $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$. Because each element of a balanced cycle occurs equally often in each iteration, the period of that component of the sum $s_{n}$ attributed to the cycle is simply 1. (The case where $f$ is a permutation of $S$ is simply a special case of this result.) In the above example, the large cycle is



unbalanced. Note the following results under $f_{2}$.

| $n$ | $\overbrace{\left(f_{2} \circ \cdots \circ f_{2}\right)}^{n}(T)$ | $s_{n}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | $[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]$ | 54 |
| 2 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,7,3,9,4]$ | 41 |
| 3 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,9,4,7,5]$ | 40 |
| 4 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,7,5,9,1]$ | 42 |
| 5 | $[1,2,3,4,5,1,9,1,7,2]$ | 35 |
| 6 | $[2,3,4,5,1,2,7,2,9,3]$ | 38 |
| 7 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,9,3,7,4]$ | 41 |
| 8 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,7,4,9,5]$ | 40 |
| 9 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,9,5,7,1]$ | 42 |

The period of $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$ for $f_{2}$ is 5 , the period of the unbalanced cycle.

The interested reader may inquire whether all unbalanced cycles affect the periodicity of $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$; we encourage those readers to explore the matter independently. For the purposes of solving this problem, it is sufficient to note that unbalanced cycles can affect $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$ 's periodicity.

Finally, note that an unbalanced $k$-cycle actually requires at least $k+1$ elements: $k$ to form the cycle, plus at least 1 to be absorbed into the cycle and cause the imbalance. For the original set $S$, one way to create such an imbalance would be to have $f(20)=f(1)=$ $2, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, \ldots, f(19)=1$. This arrangement creates an unbalanced cycle of length 19. But breaking up into smaller unbalanced cycles makes it possible to increase the period of $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$ even more, because then in most cases the period is the least common multiple of the periods of the unbalanced cycles. For example, $f:[1,2,3, \ldots, 20]=$ $[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,11,11,11]$ has an unbalanced cycle of length 9 and an unbalanced cycle of length 8 , giving $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$ a period of 72 .

So the goal is to maximize $\operatorname{lcm}\left\{k_{1}, k_{2}, \ldots, k_{m}\right\}$ such that $k_{1}+k_{2}+\cdots+k_{m}+m \leq 20$. With $m=2$, the maximal period is 72 , achieved with $k_{1}=9$ and $k_{2}=8$. With $m=3$, $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3} \leq 17$, but $\operatorname{lcm}\{7,6,4\}=84<\operatorname{lcm}\{7,5,4\}=140$. This last result can be obtained with unbalanced cycles of length 4,5 , and 7 , with the remaining four points entering the three cycles (or with one point forming a balanced cycle of length 1, i.e., a fixed point). Choosing larger values of $m$ decreases the values of $k$ so far that they no longer form long cycles: when $m=4, k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}+k_{4} \leq 16$, and even if $k_{4}=2, k_{3}=3$, and $k_{2}=5$, for a period of 30 , the largest possible value of $k_{1}=6$, which does not alter the period. (Even $k_{1}=7, k_{2}=5$, and $k_{3}=k_{4}=2$ only yields a period of 70 .) Thus the maximum period of $s_{n}$ is $\mathbf{1 4 0}$. One such function $f$ is given below.

The conclusion is that not all many-to-one functions produce unbalanced cycles.

There are two ways a function $g$ can produce balanced cycles. First, the cycles can be selfcontained, so no element outside of the cycle is ever absorbed into the cycle, as happens with the 6-cycle in the example above.
