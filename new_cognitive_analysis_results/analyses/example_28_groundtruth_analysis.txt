Problem:
 $(BEL 5)$  Let  $G$  be the centroid of the triangle  $OAB.$  $(a)$  Prove that all conics passing through the points  $O,A,B,G$  are hyperbolas. $(b)$  Find the locus of the centers of these hyperbolas.

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
### Part (a): Prove that all conics passing through the points \( O, A, B, G \) are hyperbolas.

1. **Rename \( C \equiv O \):**
   Let \( C \) be the point \( O \). Thus, we are considering the triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with centroid \( G \).

2. **Isogonal Conjugation:**
   Isogonal conjugation with respect to \( \triangle ABC \) maps the circumcircle \( \omega \) of \( \triangle ABC \) to the line at infinity. The centroid \( G \) of \( \triangle ABC \) is mapped to the symmedian point \( K \) of \( \triangle ABC \).

3. **Transformation of Conics:**
   Under isogonal conjugation, the circumconics \( \mathcal{K} \) passing through \( A, B, C, G \) are transformed into a pencil of lines passing through \( K \). Since \( K \) lies inside the circumcircle \( \omega \), each line in the pencil intersects \( \omega \) at two points.

4. **Nature of Conics:**
   Each conic \( \mathcal{K} \) has two points at infinity, implying that \( \mathcal{K} \) are hyperbolas. This is because a hyperbola is defined as a conic with two real points at infinity.

Thus, all conics passing through the points \( O, A, B, G \) are hyperbolas.

### Part (b): Find the locus of the centers of these hyperbolas.

1. **Reference to Nine-point Conic:**
   According to the reference provided, the locus of the centers of the conics passing through \( A, B, C, G \) is the conic passing through the midpoints of the sides of \( \triangle ABC \) and the midpoints of the segments joining \( G \) to the vertices \( A, B, C \).

2. **Steiner Inellipse:**
   The conic passing through the midpoints of \( BC, CA, AB \) and the midpoints of \( GA, GB, GC \) is known as the Steiner inellipse of \( \triangle ABC \).

Therefore, the locus of the centers of these hyperbolas is the Steiner inellipse of \( \triangle ABC \).

\(\blacksquare\)

The final answer is the Steiner inellipse of \( \boxed{ \triangle ABC } \).
