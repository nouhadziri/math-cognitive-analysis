Problem:
Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the set of ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ of nonnegative real numbers that lie in the plane $x+y+z=1.$ Let us say that $(x,y,z)$ supports $(a,b,c)$ when exactly two of the following are true: $x\ge a, y\ge b, z\ge c.$ Let $\mathcal{S}$ consist of those triples in $\mathcal{T}$ that support $\left(\frac 12,\frac 13,\frac 16\right).$ The area of $\mathcal{S}$ divided by the area of $\mathcal{T}$ is $m/n,$ where $m_{}$ and $n_{}$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n.$
