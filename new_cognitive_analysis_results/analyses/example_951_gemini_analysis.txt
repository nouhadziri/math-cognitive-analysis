Problem:
Jane is 25 years old. Dick is older than Jane. In $n$ years, where $n$ is a positive integer, Dick's age and Jane's age will both be two-digit numbers and will have the property that Jane's age is obtained by interchanging the digits of Dick's age. Let $d$ be Dick's present age. How many ordered pairs of positive integers $(d,n)$ are possible?

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(d,n)$ that satisfy certain conditions related to the ages of Jane and Dick.

Jane's present age is 25.
Dick's present age is $d$, and $d > 25$.

In $n$ years:
Jane's age will be $25 + n$.
Dick's age will be $d + n$.

Both $25+n$ and $d+n$ are two-digit numbers. This means:
$10 \le 25 + n \le 99 \implies -15 \le n \le 74$. Since $n$ is a positive integer, $1 \le n \le 74$.
$10 \le d + n \le 99$.

Jane's age in $n$ years is obtained by interchanging the digits of Dick's age in $n$ years.
Let Dick's age in $n$ years be $10a + b$, where $a, b$ are digits from 0 to 9, and $a \neq 0$ since it's a two-digit number.
Dick's age in $n$ years $= d + n = 10a + b$.
Jane's age in $n$ years $= 25 + n = 10b + a$.

We have the system of equations:
1. $d + n = 10a + b$
2. $25 + n = 10b + a$

From equation (2), we can express $n$ in terms of $a$ and $b$:
$n = 10b + a - 25$.

Since $1 \le n \le 74$, we have:
$1 \le 10b + a - 25 \le 74$
$26 \le 10b + a \le 99$.

Also, $10b + a$ represents Jane's age in $n$ years, which is a two-digit number.
The two-digit number $10b + a$ is Jane's age in $n$ years, so $10 \le 10b + a \le 99$.
Combining with $26 \le 10b + a$, we still have $26 \le 10b + a \le 99$.

Since $10b + a$ is Jane's age in $n$ years, and it's formed by interchanging the digits of Dick's age $10a + b$, we know that $a \neq b$.

Now substitute the expression for $n$ into equation (1):
$d + (10b + a - 25) = 10a + b$
$d = 10a + b - (10b + a - 25)$
$d = 10a + b - 10b - a + 25$
$d = 9a - 9b + 25$
$d = 9(a - b) + 25$.

We know that $d > 25$, which is consistent with the formula since $a \neq b$.
If $a > b$, then $a - b \ge 1$, so $9(a - b) \ge 9$, and $d \ge 9 + 25 = 34$.
If $a < b$, then $a - b \le -1$, so $9(a - b) \le -9$, and $d \le -9 + 25 = 16$, which contradicts $d > 25$.
Therefore, we must have $a > b$.

We also know that $10a + b$ is Dick's age in $n$ years, so $10 \le 10a + b \le 99$.

We have the conditions:
1. $a, b$ are digits from 0 to 9.
2. $a > b$.
3. $26 \le 10b + a \le 99$.
4. $10 \le 10a + b \le 99$.

Consider the inequality $26 \le 10b + a \le 99$.
Since $a > b$, we have $a \ge b + 1$.
$10b + a \ge 10b + (b + 1) = 11b + 1$.
$26 \le 11b + 1 \implies 25 \le 11b \implies b \ge \frac{25}{11} = 2.27...$, so $b \ge 3$.

Also, $10b + a \le 99$. The maximum value of $b$ is 8 (if $b=9$, and $a > b$, not possible).
If $b = 8$, then $80 + a \le 99$, $a \le 19$, but $a$ is a digit.

Consider the inequality $10 \le 10a + b \le 99$. This is always true for a two-digit number $10a + b$.

Let's analyze the constraints on $a$ and $b$:
- $0 \le b \le 9$
- $0 < a \le 9$
- $a > b$
- $26 \le 10b + a \le 99$

From $26 \le 10b + a$, we have the following possibilities for $b$:
If $b = 0$, $26 \le a$, not possible since $a \le 9$.
If $b = 1, 26 \le 10 + a \implies 16 \le a$, not possible.
If $b = 2, 26 \le 20 + a \implies 6 \le a$. Since $a > b$, $a > 2$. So $6 \le a \le 9$. Possible values of $a$: 6, 7, 8, 9.
Pairs $(a, b)$: (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2).

If $b = 3, 26 \le 30 + a \implies -4 \le a$. Since $a > b=3$, $4 \le a \le 9$. Possible values of $a$: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Pairs $(a, b)$: (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3).

If $b = 4, 26 \le 40 + a \implies -14 \le a$. Since $a > b=4$, $5 \le a \le 9$. Possible values of $a$: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Pairs $(a, b)$: (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4).

If $b = 5, 26 \le 50 + a \implies -24 \le a$. Since $a > b=5$, $6 \le a \le 9$. Possible values of $a$: 6, 7, 8, 9.
Pairs $(a, b)$: (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5).

If $b = 6, 26 \le 60 + a \implies -34 \le a$. Since $a > b=6$, $7 \le a \le 9$. Possible values of $a$: 7, 8, 9.
Pairs $(a, b)$: (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6).

If $b = 7, 26 \le 70 + a \implies -44 \le a$. Since $a > b=7$, $8 \le a \le 9$. Possible values of $a$: 8, 9.
Pairs $(a, b)$: (8, 7), (9, 7).

If $b = 8, 26 \le 80 + a \implies -54 \le a$. Since $a > b=8$, $a = 9$. Possible values of $a$: 9.
Pairs $(a, b)$: (9, 8).

If $b = 9$, not possible since $a > b$.

Now consider the upper bound $10b + a \le 99$. This is always satisfied for the pairs found above.

The possible pairs $(a, b)$ are:
$b=2$: (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2) - 4 pairs
$b=3$: (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3) - 6 pairs
$b=4$: (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4) - 5 pairs
$b=5$: (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5) - 4 pairs
$b=6$: (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6) - 3 pairs
$b=7$: (8, 7), (9, 7) - 2 pairs
$b=8$: (9, 8) - 1 pair

Total number of possible pairs $(a, b)$ is $4 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 25$.

Each valid pair $(a, b)$ corresponds to a unique value of $d$ and $n$.
$d = 9(a - b) + 25$.
$n = 10b + a - 25$.

We need to ensure that for each valid pair $(a, b)$, $n$ is a positive integer.
$n = 10b + a - 25$.
We know that $26 \le 10b + a \le 99$, so $1 \le 10b + a - 25 \le 74$.
This means $1 \le n \le 74$, so $n$ is a positive integer.

Now we need to find the ordered pairs $(d, n)$. Each valid pair $(a, b)$ gives a unique $(d, n)$.
The number of ordered pairs $(d, n)$ is equal to the number of valid pairs $(a, b)$.

Let's verify the constraints on Dick's age in $n$ years, $10a + b$, which should be between 10 and 99.
This is guaranteed by the definition of $a$ and $b$ as digits of a two-digit number.

Let's verify the constraints on Jane's age in $n$ years, $10b + a$, which should be between 10 and 99.
We have $26 \le 10b + a \le 99$, so this is also satisfied.

Example:
Consider the pair $(a, b) = (6, 2)$.
$d = 9(6 - 2) + 25 = 9(4) + 25 = 36 + 25 = 61$.
$n = 10(2) + 6 - 25 = 20 + 6 - 25 = 1$.
Check conditions:
$d = 61 > 25$.
In $n=1$ year:
Jane's age = $25 + 1 = 26$.
Dick's age = $61 + 1 = 62$.
Jane's age (26) is obtained by interchanging digits of Dick's age (62).
Both are two-digit numbers.

Consider the pair $(a, b) = (9, 8)$.
$d = 9(9 - 8) + 25 = 9(1) + 25 = 9 + 25 = 34$.
$n = 10(8) + 9 - 25 = 80 + 9 - 25 = 64$.
Check conditions:
$d = 34 > 25$.
In $n=64$ years:
Jane's age = $25 + 64 = 89$.
Dick's age = $34 + 64 = 98$.
Jane's age (89) is obtained by interchanging digits of Dick's age (98).
Both are two-digit numbers.

The number of ordered pairs $(d, n)$ is the number of valid pairs $(a, b)$, which is 25.

Double check the reasoning and constraints.
We started with the conditions given in the problem and derived relationships between $d, n, a, b$.
The core of the problem is finding the number of valid pairs of digits $(a, b)$ that satisfy the derived constraints.

The constraints on $a$ and $b$:
1. $a, b \in \{0, 1, ..., 9\}$
2. $a \neq 0$ (since $10a + b$ is a two-digit number)
3. $a > b$
4. $26 \le 10b + a \le 99$

The number of pairs $(a, b)$ satisfying these conditions was found to be 25.

Each valid pair $(a, b)$ leads to a unique pair $(d, n)$.
$d = 9(a - b) + 25$
$n = 10b + a - 25$

Since the mapping from $(a, b)$ to $(d, n)$ is unique, the number of ordered pairs $(d, n)$ is equal to the number of valid pairs $(a, b)$.

Consider the constraints on $n$: $n$ is a positive integer.
$n = 10b + a - 25$.
We used the condition that Jane's age in $n$ years is a two-digit number: $10 \le 25 + n \le 99$, which gave $1 \le n \le 74$.
This was used to derive the constraint $26 \le 10b + a \le 99$.

Let's ensure all conditions are met for each valid $(a, b)$ pair.
If $(a, b)$ is a valid pair, then:
- $a, b$ are digits, $a \neq 0$.
- $a > b$.
- $26 \le 10b + a \le 99$.

From these, we can derive properties of $d$ and $n$:
$d = 9(a - b) + 25$. Since $a > b$, $a - b \ge 1$, so $d \ge 9(1) + 25 = 34$.
$d$ is an integer.

$n = 10b + a - 25$. Since $26 \le 10b + a \le 99$, we have $1 \le n \le 74$.
$n$ is a positive integer.

Jane's age in $n$ years: $25 + n = 25 + (10b + a - 25) = 10b + a$.
Since $26 \le 10b + a \le 99$, Jane's age is a two-digit number.

Dick's age in $n$ years: $d + n = (9(a - b) + 25) + (10b + a - 25)$
$= 9a - 9b + 25 + 10b + a - 25 = 10a + b$.
Since $a > b \ge 0$, and $a \le 9$, $10 \le 10a + b \le 99$, so Dick's age is a two-digit number.

Jane's age in $n$ years ($10b + a$) is obtained by interchanging the digits of Dick's age in $n$ years ($10a + b$). This is true by construction.

Dick's present age $d = 9(a - b) + 25$.
Since $a > b$, $d > 25$.

All conditions are satisfied for each valid pair $(a, b)$.
The number of ordered pairs $(d, n)$ is equal to the number of valid pairs $(a, b)$, which is 25.

Final check of the question: "How many ordered pairs of positive integers $(d,n)$ are possible?"

We found that each valid pair of digits $(a, b)$ corresponds to a unique ordered pair of positive integers $(d, n)$ that satisfies all the conditions. The number of such valid pairs $(a, b)$ is 25.
Therefore, the number of possible ordered pairs $(d, n)$ is 25.

$26 \le 11b + 1 \implies 25 \le 11b \implies b \ge \frac{25}{11} = 2.27...$, so $b \ge 3$.

Also, $10b + a \le 99$. The maximum value of $b$ is 8 (if $b=9$, and $a > b$, not possible).

<text>Example:
Consider the pair $(a, b) = (6, 2)$.
$d = 9(6 - 2) + 25 = 9(4) + 25 = 36 + 25 = 61$.
$n = 10(2) + 6 - 25 = 20 + 6 - 25 = 1$.
Check conditions:
$d = 61 > 25$.
In $n=1$ year:
Jane's age = $25 + 1 = 26$.
Dick's age = $61 + 1 = 62$.
Jane's age (26) is obtained by interchanging digits of Dick's age (62).
Both are two-digit numbers.

Consider the pair $(a, b) = (9, 8)$.
$d = 9(9 - 8) + 25 = 9(1) + 25 = 9 + 25 = 34$.
$n = 10(8) + 9 - 25 = 80 + 9 - 25 = 64$.
Check conditions:
$d = 34 > 25$.
In $n=64$ years:
Jane's age = $25 + 64 = 89$.
Dick's age = $34 + 64 = 98$.
Jane's age (89) is obtained by interchanging digits of Dick's age (98).
Both are two-digit numbers.</text>

<text>Let's ensure all conditions are met for each valid $(a, b)$ pair.
If $(a, b)$ is a valid pair, then:
- $a, b$ are digits, $a \neq 0$.

From these, we can derive properties of $d$ and $n$:
$d = 9(a - b) + 25$. Since $a > b$, $a - b \ge 1$, so $d \ge 9(1) + 25 = 34$.
$d$ is an integer.

$n = 10b + a - 25$. Since $26 \le 10b + a \le 99$, we have $1 \le n \le 74$.
$n$ is a positive integer.

Jane's age in $n$ years: $25 + n = 25 + (10b + a - 25) = 10b + a$.
Since $26 \le 10b + a \le 99$, Jane's age is a two-digit number.

Dick's age in $n$ years: $d + n = (9(a - b) + 25) + (10b + a - 25)$
$= 9a - 9b + 25 + 10b + a - 25 = 10a + b$.
Since $a > b \ge 0$, and $a \le 9$, $10 \le 10a + b \le 99$, so Dick's age is a two-digit number.

Jane's age in $n$ years ($10b + a$) is obtained by interchanging the digits of Dick's age in $n$ years ($10a + b$). This is true by construction.

Dick's present age $d = 9(a - b) + 25$.
Since $a > b$, $d > 25$.</text>
