Problem:
Let  $n\geq1$  be a positive integer.  $n$  lamps are placed in a line. At minute 0, some lamps are on (maybe all of them). Every minute the state of the lamps changes: A lamp is on at minute  $t+1$  if and only if at minute  $t$ , exactly one of its neighbors is on (the two lamps at the ends have one neighbor each, all other lamps have two neighbors).

For which values of  $n$  can we guarantee that all lamps will be off after some time?

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Initial Setup and Definitions:**
   - We have \( n \) lamps in a line, where \( n \geq 1 \).
   - At minute 0, some lamps are on, and others are off.
   - The state of each lamp changes every minute according to the rule: a lamp is on at minute \( t+1 \) if and only if at minute \( t \), exactly one of its neighbors is on.

2. **Behavior Analysis for Small \( n \):**
   - For \( n = 1 \): The single lamp will remain in its initial state forever since it has no neighbors.
   - For \( n = 2 \): The lamps will turn off if they start in different states (one on, one off). If both are on or both are off, they will remain in that state.
   - For \( n = 3 \): The lamps will turn off if they start in the state 101 or 010. Other initial states will not lead to all lamps being off.

3. **General Pattern and Parity Consideration:**
   - We need to consider the parity (odd or even) of \( n \).
   - For \( n \) even: We can show that it is possible to guarantee all lamps will be off after some time.
     - Consider the initial state where lamps are alternately on and off (e.g., 1010 for \( n = 4 \)). This pattern will eventually lead to all lamps being off.
   - For \( n \) odd: It is not always possible to guarantee that all lamps will be off.
     - For example, for \( n = 5 \), the initial state 11011 will not lead to all lamps being off.

4. **Proof for Even \( n \):**
   - Consider an initial state where lamps are alternately on and off.
   - At each step, the pattern will shift, and eventually, all lamps will turn off.
   - This can be shown by induction or by observing the behavior of smaller cases and generalizing.

5. **Counterexample for Odd \( n \):**
   - For \( n = 5 \), the initial state 11011 does not lead to all lamps being off.
   - This suggests that for odd \( n \), there exist initial states that will not result in all lamps being off.

Conclusion:
- For even \( n \), we can guarantee that all lamps will be off after some time.
- For odd \( n \), we cannot guarantee that all lamps will be off after some time.

The final answer is \( \boxed{ n } \) must be even.
