Problem:
Given are real numbers $x, y$. For any pair of real numbers $a_{0}, a_{1}$, define a sequence by $a_{n+2}=x a_{n+1}+y a_{n}$ for $n \geq 0$. Suppose that there exists a fixed nonnegative integer $m$ such that, for every choice of $a_{0}$ and $a_{1}$, the numbers $a_{m}, a_{m+1}, a_{m+3}$, in this order, form an arithmetic progression. Find all possible values of $y$.

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the values of $y$ such that for a sequence defined by the linear recurrence relation $a_{n+2}=x a_{n+1}+y a_{n}$, there exists a fixed nonnegative integer $m$ where $a_{m}, a_{m+1}, a_{m+3}$ form an arithmetic progression for every choice of initial values $a_0, a_1$.

The condition that $a_{m}, a_{m+1}, a_{m+3}$ form an arithmetic progression means that $a_{m+1} - a_{m} = a_{m+3} - a_{m+1}$, or $2 a_{m+1} = a_{m} + a_{m+3}$.

We have the recurrence relation $a_{n+2}=x a_{n+1}+y a_{n}$.
Using this, we can express $a_{m+3}$ in terms of earlier terms:
$a_{m+3} = x a_{m+2} + y a_{m+1}$
$a_{m+3} = x (x a_{m+1} + y a_{m}) + y a_{m+1}$
$a_{m+3} = x^2 a_{m+1} + xy a_{m} + y a_{m+1}$
$a_{m+3} = (x^2+y) a_{m+1} + xy a_{m}$

Substitute this into the arithmetic progression condition:
$2 a_{m+1} = a_{m} + (x^2+y) a_{m+1} + xy a_{m}$
$2 a_{m+1} = (1+xy) a_{m} + (x^2+y) a_{m+1}$
$2 a_{m+1} - (x^2+y) a_{m+1} = (1+xy) a_{m}$
$(2 - x^2 - y) a_{m+1} = (1+xy) a_{m}$

This equation must hold for every choice of $a_0$ and $a_1$.

Case 1: $m=0$.
The condition is on $a_0, a_1, a_3$.
$2 a_1 = a_0 + a_3$
$a_3 = x a_2 + y a_1 = x (x a_1 + y a_0) + y a_1 = x^2 a_1 + xy a_0 + y a_1 = (x^2+y) a_1 + xy a_0$
$2 a_1 = a_0 + (x^2+y) a_1 + xy a_0$
$2 a_1 = (1+xy) a_0 + (x^2+y) a_1$
$(2 - x^2 - y) a_1 = (1+xy) a_0$

This equation must hold for all $a_0, a_1$. This implies the coefficients of $a_0$ and $a_1$ must be zero.
$2 - x^2 - y = 0 \implies y = 2 - x^2$
$1 + xy = 0 \implies xy = -1$

Substitute $y = 2 - x^2$ into $xy = -1$:
$x (2 - x^2) = -1$
$2x - x^3 = -1$
$x^3 - 2x - 1 = 0$

We can try integer roots of this cubic polynomial. The divisors of $-1$ are $1, -1$.
If $x=1$, $1^3 - 2(1) - 1 = 1 - 2 - 1 = -2 \neq 0$.
If $x=-1$, $(-1)^3 - 2(-1) - 1 = -1 + 2 - 1 = 0$.
So, $x=-1$ is a root.
We can factor the polynomial: $(x+1)(x^2 - x - 1) = 0$.
The roots are $x=-1$, $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

If $x=-1$, $y = 2 - (-1)^2 = 2 - 1 = 1$.
Check $xy = (-1)(1) = -1$. This works. So $y=1$ is a possibility when $m=0$.

If $x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$, $y = 2 - (\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})^2 = 2 - \frac{1 + 5 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2 - \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2 - \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{4 - 3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$.
Check $xy = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - 5}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1$. This works.

If $x = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$, $y = 2 - (\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2})^2 = 2 - \frac{1 + 5 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2 - \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2 - \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{4 - 3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.
Check $xy = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - 5}{4} = -1$. This works.

So, if $m=0$, the possible values of $y$ are $1, \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}, \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

Case 2: $m \geq 1$.
The equation $(2 - x^2 - y) a_{m+1} = (1+xy) a_{m}$ must hold for all $a_0, a_1$.

Consider the space of sequences satisfying the recurrence relation. It is a 2-dimensional vector space. Let the characteristic equation be $r^2 - xr - y = 0$. Let the roots be $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$.
If $\lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2$, then $a_n = c_1 \lambda_1^n + c_2 \lambda_2^n$.
If $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \lambda$, then $a_n = (c_1 + c_2 n) \lambda^n$.

Subcase 2.1: $2 - x^2 - y \neq 0$.
Then $\frac{a_{m+1}}{a_{m}} = \frac{1+xy}{2 - x^2 - y}$.
The ratio $\frac{a_{m+1}}{a_{m}}$ must be constant for all sequences.

If $a_0=1, a_1=0$, then $a_2 = y, a_3 = xy, a_4 = x^2y+y^2, \dots$
If $a_0=0, a_1=1$, then $a_2 = x, a_3 = x^2+y, a_4 = x^3+xy+xy = x^3+2xy, \dots$

If the ratio is constant, then for the sequence with $a_0=1, a_1=0$, $\frac{a_{m+1}}{a_m} = R$.
For the sequence with $a_0=0, a_1=1$, $\frac{b_{m+1}}{b_m} = R$.

Consider $m=1$. The condition is on $a_1, a_2, a_4$.
$2 a_2 = a_1 + a_4$.
$a_4 = x a_3 + y a_2 = x (x a_2 + y a_1) + y a_2 = x^2 a_2 + xy a_1 + y a_2 = (x^2+y) a_2 + xy a_1$.
$2 a_2 = a_1 + (x^2+y) a_2 + xy a_1$
$(2 - x^2 - y) a_2 = (1+xy) a_1$.

Substitute $a_2 = x a_1 + y a_0$:
$(2 - x^2 - y) (x a_1 + y a_0) = (1+xy) a_1$.
$(2 - x^2 - y) y a_0 + [(2 - x^2 - y) x - (1+xy)] a_1 = 0$.

This must hold for all $a_0, a_1$.
Coefficient of $a_0$: $(2 - x^2 - y) y = 0$.
Coefficient of $a_1$: $(2 - x^2 - y) x - (1+xy) = 0$.

From the first equation, $y=0$ or $2 - x^2 - y = 0 \implies y = 2 - x^2$.

If $y=0$, the second equation becomes $(2 - x^2) x - 1 = 0$, so $2x - x^3 - 1 = 0$, $x^3 - 2x + 1 = 0$.
If $x=1$, $1 - 2 + 1 = 0$. So $x=1$ is a root.
$(x-1)(x^2 + x - 1) = 0$.
Roots are $x=1$, $x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$.
So, if $y=0$, possible values of $x$ are $1, \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

If $y = 2 - x^2$, the second equation becomes:
$(2 - x^2 - (2 - x^2)) x - (1 + x(2 - x^2)) = 0$
$0 \cdot x - (1 + 2x - x^3) = 0$
$-(1 + 2x - x^3) = 0$
$x^3 - 2x - 1 = 0$.
This is the same cubic as before, with roots $-1, \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

Possible values of $y$ when $m=1$:
If $y=0$, then $y=0$.
If $y = 2 - x^2$, then $y = 2 - (-1)^2 = 1$, $y = 2 - (\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})^2 = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$, $y = 2 - (\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2})^2 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.
So, possible values of $y$ are $0, 1, \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}, \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

Now, consider the general case $m \geq 1$.
The equation is $(2 - x^2 - y) a_{m+1} = (1+xy) a_{m}$.

If $2 - x^2 - y = 0$ and $1+xy = 0$, then the equation holds for all sequences.
This gives $y = 2 - x^2$ and $xy = -1$, leading to $x^3 - 2x - 1 = 0$, with solutions for $x$ and corresponding $y$ as found in the $m=0$ case.
Possible values of $y$: $1, \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}, \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

If $2 - x^2 - y \neq 0$, then $\frac{a_{m+1}}{a_m} = \frac{1+xy}{2 - x^2 - y} = C$, a constant.

Consider the characteristic equation $r^2 - xr - y = 0$.
Roots $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$.

If $\lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2$, then $\frac{a_{m+1}}{a_m} = \frac{c_1 \lambda_1^{m+1} + c_2 \lambda_2^{m+1}}{c_1 \lambda_1^m + c_2 \lambda_2^m}$.
For this ratio to be constant for all $c_1, c_2$, we must have either $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2$ or one of $c_1, c_2$ is always zero, which is not the case since $a_0, a_1$ are arbitrary.

If $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \lambda$, then $\frac{a_{m+1}}{a_m} = \frac{(c_1 + c_2 (m+1)) \lambda^{m+1}}{(c_1 + c_2 m) \lambda^m} = \lambda \frac{c_1 + c_2 m + c_2}{c_1 + c_2 m}$.
For this to be constant, we need $c_2 = 0$, which is not always true.

So, if $2 - x^2 - y \neq 0$, the ratio $\frac{a_{m+1}}{a_m}$ is constant only if the sequence behaves like a geometric progression.
This means the roots of the characteristic equation are equal, $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \lambda$, and $\frac{a_{m+1}}{a_m} = \lambda$.
So, $\lambda = \frac{1+xy}{2 - x^2 - y}$.

Also, for equal roots, the discriminant of the characteristic equation is zero:
$x^2 - 4(-y) = 0 \implies x^2 + 4y = 0 \implies y = -\frac{x^2}{4}$.

Substitute this into the expression for $\lambda$.
The root $\lambda = \frac{-(-x)}{2(1)} = \frac{x}{2}$.
$\frac{x}{2} = \frac{1 + x(-\frac{x^2}{4})}{2 - x^2 - (-\frac{x^2}{4})} = \frac{1 - \frac{x^3}{4}}{2 - x^2 + \frac{x^2}{4}} = \frac{\frac{4 - x^3}{4}}{\frac{8 - 4x^2 + x^2}{4}} = \frac{4 - x^3}{8 - 3x^2}$.

$\frac{x}{2} = \frac{4 - x^3}{8 - 3x^2}$
$x(8 - 3x^2) = 2(4 - x^3)$
$8x - 3x^3 = 8 - 2x^3$
$8x - 8 = 3x^3 - 2x^3 = x^3$
$x^3 - 8x + 8 = 0$.

Consider the case where $1+xy = 0$ and $2 - x^2 - y \neq 0$.
Then $(2 - x^2 - y) a_{m+1} = 0$, so $a_{m+1} = 0$ for all sequences.
If $a_{m+1} = 0$, then $a_{m+3} = x a_{m+2} + y a_{m+1} = x a_{m+2}$.
The arithmetic progression condition is $2 a_{m+1} = a_m + a_{m+3}$, so $0 = a_m + x a_{m+2}$.
$a_m + x (x a_{m+1} + y a_m) = 0$
$a_m + x (0 + y a_m) = 0$
$a_m + xy a_m = 0$
$(1+xy) a_m = 0$.
Since $1+xy = 0$, this holds.

We need $a_{m+1} = 0$ for all sequences.
If $m=0$, $a_1 = 0$. This requires $a_1=0$ for all choices, impossible.
If $m \geq 1$, we need the coefficient of $a_0$ and $a_1$ in the expression for $a_{m+1}$ to be zero.

Example: $m=1$, $a_2 = x a_1 + y a_0 = 0$ for all $a_0, a_1$.
Requires $x=0, y=0$.
If $x=0, y=0$, then $a_{n+2} = 0$. So $a_n = 0$ for $n \geq 2$.
$a_1, a_2, a_4$ becomes $a_1, 0, 0$.
$2 \cdot 0 = a_1 + 0$, so $a_1 = 0$.
If $a_0=1, a_1=0$, then $a_1=0$.

If $1+xy = 0$, then $y = -\frac{1}{x}$.
$2 - x^2 - (-\frac{1}{x}) \neq 0$
$2 - x^2 + \frac{1}{x} \neq 0$
$\frac{2x - x^3 + 1}{x} \neq 0$, so $x^3 - 2x - 1 \neq 0$.

Consider the case where the condition holds for all $a_0, a_1$.
$(2 - x^2 - y) a_{m+1} = (1+xy) a_{m}$.

If $m$ exists, then either $2 - x^2 - y = 0$ and $1+xy = 0$,
or the ratio $\frac{a_{m+1}}{a_m}$ is constant.

If the ratio is constant, then the sequence is a geometric progression eventually.
This happens if the roots of the characteristic equation are equal, $y = -\frac{x^2}{4}$.
The ratio is the common root $\lambda = \frac{x}{2}$.
$\frac{x}{2} = \frac{1 + x(-\frac{x^2}{4})}{2 - x^2 - (-\frac{x^2}{4})} = \frac{4 - x^3}{8 - 3x^2}$.
This leads to $x^3 - 8x + 8 = 0$.

Let's analyze the condition more directly.
The condition is $2 a_{m+1} = a_m + a_{m+3}$ for all $a_0, a_1$.
This is a linear condition on $a_m, a_{m+1}, a_{m+3}$.
Express these in terms of $a_0, a_1$.
$a_m = P_m(x,y) a_1 + Q_m(x,y) a_0$
$a_{m+1} = P_{m+1}(x,y) a_1 + Q_{m+1}(x,y) a_0$
$a_{m+3} = P_{m+3}(x,y) a_1 + Q_{m+3}(x,y) a_0$

$2 (P_{m+1} a_1 + Q_{m+1} a_0) = (P_m a_1 + Q_m a_0) + (P_{m+3} a_1 + Q_{m+3} a_0)$
$(2 P_{m+1} - P_m - P_{m+3}) a_1 + (2 Q_{m+1} - Q_m - Q_{m+3}) a_0 = 0$.

This must hold for all $a_0, a_1$, so the coefficients must be zero.
$2 P_{m+1} - P_m - P_{m+3} = 0$
$2 Q_{m+1} - Q_m - Q_{m+3} = 0$.

The sequences $P_n$ and $Q_n$ satisfy the recurrence relation.
$P_0 = 0, P_1 = 1, P_2 = x, P_3 = x^2+y, \dots$
$Q_0 = 1, Q_1 = 0, Q_2 = y, Q_3 = xy, \dots$

The conditions mean that the sequences $P_n$ and $Q_n$ satisfy the arithmetic progression condition at index $m$.
$P_m, P_{m+1}, P_{m+3}$ form an arithmetic progression.
$Q_m, Q_{m+1}, Q_{m+3}$ form an arithmetic progression.

Consider the case where the characteristic equation has distinct roots $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$.
$P_n = A \lambda_1^n + B \lambda_2^n$
$Q_n = C \lambda_1^n + D \lambda_2^n$

$P_0 = 0 \implies A+B = 0 \implies B=-A$
$P_1 = 1 \implies A \lambda_1 - A \lambda_2 = 1 \implies A (\lambda_1 - \lambda_2) = 1 \implies A = \frac{1}{\lambda_1 - \lambda_2}$
$P_n = \frac{\lambda_1^n - \lambda_2^n}{\lambda_1 - \lambda_2}$

$Q_0 = 1 \implies C+D = 1$
$Q_1 = 0 \implies C \lambda_1 + D \lambda_2 = 0 \implies C \lambda_1 = -(1-C) \lambda_2$
$C \lambda_1 = -\lambda_2 + C \lambda_2 \implies C (\lambda_1 - \lambda_2) = -\lambda_2 \implies C = -\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1 - \lambda_2}$
$D = 1 - C = 1 + \frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1 - \lambda_2} = \frac{\lambda_1 - \lambda_2 + \lambda_2}{\lambda_1 - \lambda_2} = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_1 - \lambda_2}$
$Q_n = \frac{-\lambda_2 \lambda_1^n + \lambda_1 \lambda_2^n}{\lambda_1 - \lambda_2}$

The conditions $2 P_{m+1} = P_m + P_{m+3}$ and $2 Q_{m+1} = Q_m + Q_{m+3}$ must hold.

If $m=0$, the possible values of $y$ are $1, \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}, \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

Then $\frac{a_{m+1}}{a_{m}} = \frac{1+xy}{2 - x^2 - y}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver systematically breaks down the analysis into subcases based on whether the coefficient (2-x²-y) is zero or not, ensuring all possibilities are covered.</explanation>

<start>3061</start>
<end>3143</end>
<text>If $2 - x^2 - y \neq 0$, then $\frac{a_{m+1}}{a_m} = \frac{1+xy}{2 - x^2 - y} = C$, a constant.</text>
<explanation>The solver continues the systematic case analysis by examining what happens when the coefficient is non-zero, considering the implications for the ratio of consecutive terms.</explanation>

<start>3473</start>
<end>3669</end>
<text>Consider the case where $1+xy = 0$ and $2 - x^2 - y \neq 0$.
Then $(2 - x^2 - y) a_{m+1} = 0$, so $a_{m+1} = 0$ for all sequences.
If $a_{m+1} = 0$, then $a_{m+3} = x a_{m+2} + y a_{m+1} = x a_{m+2}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver examines another specific case where one coefficient is zero and the other is non-zero, methodically working through the implications of this scenario.</explanation>

<skill>Polynomial Root Finding</skill>
<definition>The ability to determine the values that make a polynomial equation equal to zero, using various techniques such as factoring, the quadratic formula, or numerical methods.</definition>

<start>1470</start>
<end>1620</end>
<text>So, $x=-1$ is a root.
We can factor the polynomial: $(x+1)(x^2 - x - 1) = 0$.
The roots are $x=-1$, $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$.</text>
<explanation>After identifying one root of the cubic equation, the solver factors the polynomial and applies the quadratic formula to find the remaining roots, demonstrating skill in polynomial root finding.</explanation>

<start>2414</start>
<end>2674</end>
<text>If $x=1$, $1 - 2 + 1 = 0$. So $x=1$ is a root.
$(x-1)(x^2 + x - 1) = 0$.
Roots are $x=1$, $x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$.
So, if $y=0$, possible values of $x$ are $1, \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver finds and factors another cubic polynomial, demonstrating proficiency in identifying roots and using the quadratic formula to solve for the remaining roots after factoring.</explanation>

<skill>Verification and Checking</skill>
<definition>The process of confirming that proposed solutions satisfy all the conditions of the problem, often by substituting values back into original equations.</definition>

<start>1621</start>
<end>1788</end>
<text>If $x=-1$, $y = 2 - (-1)^2 = 2 - 1 = 1$.
Check $xy = (-1)(1) = -1$. This works. So $y=1$ is a possibility when $m=0$.</text>
<explanation>After finding values for x and y, the solver verifies that they satisfy the original constraint xy = -1, demonstrating careful checking of proposed solutions.</explanation>

<start>1789</start>
<end>1926</end>
<text>If $x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$, $y = 2 - (\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})^2 = 2 - \frac{1 + 5 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2 - \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2 - \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{4 - 3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$.
Check $xy = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - 5}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1$. This works.</text>
<explanation>The solver carefully computes the value of y corresponding to a specific value of x, then verifies that the pair satisfies the constraint xy = -1, showing thoroughness in checking solutions.</explanation>

<skill>Recurrence Relation Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to analyze and solve problems involving sequences defined by relations between consecutive terms.</definition>

<start>307</start>
<end>637</end>
<text>We have the recurrence relation $a_{n+2}=x a_{n+1}+y a_{n}$.
Using this, we can express $a_{m+3}$ in terms of earlier terms:
$a_{m+3} = x a_{m+2} + y a_{m+1}$
$a_{m+3} = x (x a_{m+1} + y a_{m}) + y a_{m+1}$
$a_{m+3} = x^2 a_{m+1} + xy a_{m} + y a_{m+1}$
$a_{m+3} = (x^2+y) a_{m+1} + xy a_{m}$</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates expertise in working with recurrence relations by iteratively applying the relation to express later terms in the sequence in terms of earlier ones.</explanation>

<start>1666</start>
<end>1926</end>
<text>Consider the space of sequences satisfying the recurrence relation. It is a 2-dimensional vector space. Let the characteristic equation be $r^2 - xr - y = 0$. Let the roots be $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$.
If $\lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2$, then $a_n = c_1 \lambda_1^n + c_2 \lambda_2
