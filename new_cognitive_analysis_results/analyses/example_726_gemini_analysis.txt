Problem:
Two parallel square plates of side length $1 \mathrm{~m}$ are placed a distance $30 \mathrm{~cm}$ apart whose centers are at $(-15 \mathrm{~cm}, 0,0)$ and $(15 \mathrm{~cm}, 0,0)$ have uniform charge densities $-10^{-6} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ and $10^{-6} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ respectively. Find the magnitude of the component of the electric field perpendicular to axis passing through the centers of the two plates at $(10 \mathrm{~cm}, 1 \mathrm{~mm}, 0)$.

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
The problem involves two parallel square plates with uniform charge densities. We need to find the electric field at a specific point.

Let the two plates be Plate 1 and Plate 2.
Plate 1 is centered at $(-15 \mathrm{~cm}, 0,0)$ and has charge density $\sigma_1 = -10^{-6} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$.
Plate 2 is centered at $(15 \mathrm{~cm}, 0,0)$ and has charge density $\sigma_2 = 10^{-6} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$.
The side length of the plates is $1 \mathrm{~m}$.
The distance between the plates is $30 \mathrm{~cm}$.

The point at which we need to find the electric field is $P = (10 \mathrm{~cm}, 1 \mathrm{~mm}, 0)$.
In meters, the centers of the plates are at $(-0.15 \mathrm{~m}, 0,0)$ and $(0.15 \mathrm{~m}, 0,0)$.
The point P is at $(0.10 \mathrm{~m}, 0.001 \mathrm{~m}, 0)$.

The axis passing through the centers of the two plates is the x-axis.
The component of the electric field perpendicular to this axis will be the y and z components. In this case, since the point is in the x-y plane, we need to find the y-component of the electric field.

For an infinite sheet of charge, the electric field is uniform and given by $E = \frac{\sigma}{2 \epsilon_0}$. The direction of the electric field is away from a positive charge sheet and towards a negative charge sheet.

Since the plates are finite, we cannot directly use the formula for an infinite sheet. However, the distance to the point P from the plates is much smaller than the size of the plates, so we can approximate the electric field using the infinite sheet formula.

Electric field due to Plate 1 (negative charge density) will be towards the plate.
Electric field due to Plate 2 (positive charge density) will be away from the plate.

The electric field due to Plate 1 at point P:
The x-component of the electric field $E_{1x} = -\frac{|\sigma_1|}{2 \epsilon_0} = -\frac{10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0}$
The electric field due to Plate 2 at point P:
The x-component of the electric field $E_{2x} = \frac{\sigma_2}{2 \epsilon_0} = \frac{10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0}$

The net electric field in the x-direction $E_x = E_{1x} + E_{2x} = -\frac{10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0} + \frac{10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0} = 0$.

This is an approximation for points far from the edges. The point P is at $x=10$ cm, which is between the plates.

Let's consider the exact formula for the electric field due to a finite square plate.
The electric field due to a charged square plate at a point P not on the plane of the plate has components both parallel and perpendicular to the plane.

Consider a single square plate in the xy-plane with a corner at the origin and sides of length L. The electric field at a point (x, y, z) is given by a complicated integral.

However, since the point (10 cm, 1 mm, 0) is much closer to the center line between the two plates, we can consider the contribution of the edges.

Let's consider the plates are in the yz plane.
Plate 1 is at $x = -0.15$ m, Plate 2 is at $x = 0.15$ m.
The point P is at $(0.10, 0.001, 0)$.

The perpendicular distance from P to Plate 1 is $0.10 - (-0.15) = 0.25$ m.
The perpendicular distance from P to Plate 2 is $0.15 - 0.10 = 0.05$ m.

Let's use the approximation of infinite plates first to understand the basic fields.
Electric field due to plate 1 (at $x=-0.15$) at point P is in the positive x-direction: $E_1 = \frac{|\sigma_1|}{2 \epsilon_0} = \frac{10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0}$.
Electric field due to plate 2 (at $x=0.15$) at point P is in the positive x-direction: $E_2 = \frac{|\sigma_2|}{2 \epsilon_0} = \frac{10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0}$.

The direction of the electric field due to a negative plate is towards the plate, so for plate 1 it's in the positive x direction.
The direction of the electric field due to a positive plate is away from the plate, so for plate 2 it's in the negative x direction.

Electric field due to Plate 1 at P: $\vec{E}_1 = \frac{-\sigma_1}{2 \epsilon_0} \hat{i} = \frac{10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0} \hat{i}$.
Electric field due to Plate 2 at P: $\vec{E}_2 = \frac{\sigma_2}{2 \epsilon_0} (-\hat{i}) = -\frac{10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0} \hat{i}$.

Net electric field $\vec{E} = \vec{E}_1 + \vec{E}_2 = \frac{10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0} \hat{i} - \frac{10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0} \hat{i} = 0$.

This is the component of the electric field parallel to the axis passing through the centers. We need the component perpendicular to this axis.

Consider a point very close to the center of a finite square plate. The field is approximately that of an infinite sheet. As we move away from the center, the field lines start to curve.

Let's consider the contribution of small strips of the plates.
The electric field due to a small element of charge $dq$ is $d\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{dq}{r^2} \hat{r}$.

The component of the electric field perpendicular to the x-axis will be due to the deviation from the infinite sheet case.

Consider the symmetry of the problem. The plates are in the yz plane. The point is at $(x, y, 0)$.
Let's consider Plate 2 with positive charge. The electric field will have a component in the positive x direction (dominant) and a component in the positive y direction if $y>0$ and due to the finite size.

Consider the formula for the electric field due to a finite plane of charge.
For a square plate with side L in the xy-plane, the electric field at a point (0, 0, z) on the z-axis is given by:
$E_z = \frac{\sigma}{2 \epsilon_0} \left[ \frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2 + (L/2)^2}} \right]$

This formula is for a point on the axis passing through the center and perpendicular to the plate.

Let's use superposition. Consider the plates to be in the yz-plane.
Plate 1 is centered at $x = -0.15$. Plate 2 is centered at $x = 0.15$.
Point P is at $(0.10, 0.001, 0)$.

Consider Plate 2 (positive charge).
The electric field will point generally away from the plate.
Consider a small area $dA$ on Plate 2 at $(\bar{x}, \bar{y}, \bar{z}) = (0.15, y', z')$.
The vector from the source to the field point is $\vec{r} = (0.10 - 0.15, 0.001 - y', 0 - z') = (-0.05, 0.001 - y', -z')$.
The magnitude $r = \sqrt{(-0.05)^2 + (0.001 - y')^2 + (-z')^2}$.
The electric field $d\vec{E}_2 = \frac{\sigma_2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{dA}{r^3} \vec{r}$.

The y-component of $d\vec{E}_2$ is $dE_{2y} = \frac{\sigma_2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{dA}{r^3} (0.001 - y')$.
Integrate over the plate: $\int_{-0.5}^{0.5} \int_{-0.5}^{0.5} \frac{0.001 - y'}{[(-0.05)^2 + (0.001 - y')^2 + (-z')^2]^{3/2}} dy' dz'$.

Consider Plate 1 (negative charge).
The vector from the source to the field point is $\vec{r} = (0.10 - (-0.15), 0.001 - y', 0 - z') = (0.25, 0.001 - y', -z')$.
The magnitude $r = \sqrt{(0.25)^2 + (0.001 - y')^2 + (-z')^2}$.
The electric field $d\vec{E}_1 = \frac{\sigma_1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{dA}{r^3} \vec{r}$.

The y-component of $d\vec{E}_1$ is $dE_{1y} = \frac{\sigma_1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{dA}{r^3} (0.001 - y')$.
Integrate over the plate: $\int_{-0.5}^{0.5} \int_{-0.5}^{0.5} \frac{0.001 - y'}{[(0.25)^2 + (0.001 - y')^2 + (-z')^2]^{3/2}} dy' dz'$.

Net y-component $E_y = E_{1y} + E_{2y} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{-0.5}^{0.5} \int_{-0.5}^{0.5} (0.001 - y') \left[ \frac{\sigma_1}{[(0.25)^2 + (0.001 - y')^2 + z'^2]^{3/2}} + \frac{\sigma_2}{[(-0.05)^2 + (0.001 - y')^2 + z'^2]^{3/2}} \right] dy' dz'$.
Given $\sigma_1 = -10^{-6}$ and $\sigma_2 = 10^{-6}$.
$E_y = \frac{10^{-6}}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{-0.5}^{0.5} \int_{-0.5}^{0.5} (0.001 - y') \left[ \frac{-1}{[(0.25)^2 + (0.001 - y')^2 + z'^2]^{3/2}} + \frac{1}{[(0.05)^2 + (0.001 - y')^2 + z'^2]^{3/2}} \right] dy' dz'$.

Let $I(a) = \int_{-0.5}^{0.5} \int_{-0.5}^{0.5} \frac{0.001 - y'}{[a^2 + (0.001 - y')^2 + z'^2]^{3/2}} dy' dz'$.
$E_y = \frac{10^{-6}}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} [-I(0.25) + I(0.05)]$.

Consider the case of infinite plates. The electric field is only in the x-direction. The perpendicular component is zero. The deviation from this is due to the finite size.

Let's consider the edges. The point is at a distance of $0.001$ m from the x-axis.

Consider the electric field of a single finite square plate. At a point in the plane perpendicular to the plate and passing through the center, there is only a component perpendicular to the plate.

The perpendicular component arises due to the fact that the observation point is not on the axis of symmetry.

Consider a simpler case: a line charge. The electric field has a radial component.

Let's consider the electric field due to one plate and then use superposition.
Consider Plate 2 at $x=0.15$. Point P at $(0.10, 0.001, 0)$.
The distance in the x-direction is small ($0.05$ m), while the dimensions of the plate are large ($1$ m).
The distance in the y-direction is also small ($0.001$ m).

Approximate the plate as an infinite sheet. The electric field due to Plate 2 is approximately $\frac{\sigma_2}{2 \epsilon_0}$ in the negative x-direction.
The electric field due to Plate 1 is approximately $\frac{|\sigma_1|}{2 \epsilon_0}$ in the positive x-direction.

Consider the edges of the plates.
For Plate 2, the top edge is at $y = 0.5$, bottom at $y = -0.5$. The point is at $y = 0.001$.
The right edge is at $z = 0.5$, left at $z = -0.5$. The point is at $z = 0$.

Consider the electric field due to a uniformly charged rod.

Let's think about the symmetry. If the point was at $(10 \mathrm{~cm}, 0, 0)$, the perpendicular component would be zero. The non-zero y-component is due to the $y=1 \mathrm{~mm}$ displacement.

Consider the electric field due to a single plate and consider the angles.
For Plate 2 (positive), the field lines point away. A field line from the center towards P will have a small y-component.
For Plate 1 (negative), the field lines point towards. A field line from the center towards P will have a small y-component.

Consider the top edge of Plate 2. The electric field due to this edge at P will have a component in the +y direction.
Consider the bottom edge of Plate 2. The electric field due to this edge at P will have a component in the -y direction.

Consider two infinite parallel plates. The electric field between the plates is uniform and given by $E = \frac{|\sigma_1|}{\epsilon_0}$. The direction is from the positive to the negative plate.

In this case, $\sigma_1 = -10^{-6}$ and $\sigma_2 = 10^{-6}$.
The electric field due to Plate 1 is $\frac{|\sigma_1|}{2 \epsilon_0}$ towards Plate 1 (positive x-direction).
The electric field due to Plate 2 is $\frac{|\sigma_2|}{2 \epsilon_0}$ away from Plate 2 (negative x-direction).

Net electric field $E_x = \frac{10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0} - \frac{10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0} = 0$. This is wrong.

The electric field due to a single charged plate is $\frac{\sigma}{2 \epsilon_0}$ away from (+) or towards (-).
For Plate 1, $E_1 = \frac{-10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0}$ in the +x direction.
For Plate 2, $E_2 = \frac{10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0}$ in the +x direction.

Net $E_x = \frac{-10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0} + \frac{10^{-6}}{2 \epsilon_0} = 0$. This assumes infinite plates.

Let's consider the deviation due to finite size.
The electric field lines near the edges fringe out.
