Problem:
Two three-letter strings, $aaa^{}_{}$ and $bbb^{}_{}$ , are transmitted electronically. Each string is sent letter by letter. Due to faulty equipment, each of the six letters has a 1/3 chance of being received incorrectly, as an $a^{}_{}$ when it should have been a $b^{}_{}$ , or as a $b^{}_{}$ when it should be an $a^{}_{}$ . However, whether a given letter is received correctly or incorrectly is independent of the reception of any other letter. Let $S_a^{}$ be the three-letter string received when $aaa^{}_{}$ is transmitted and let $S_b^{}$ be the three-letter string received when $bbb^{}_{}$ is transmitted. Let $p$ be the probability that $S_a^{}$ comes before $S_b^{}$ in alphabetical order. When $p$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is its numerator?

<explanation>This is an interesting case where the solution provided is just the final answer "532" without showing the problem-solving process. The solver has clearly interpreted the problem correctly to arrive at this answer, but we don't see their interpretation process. They understood that the problem involves probability calculation for string transmission errors and alphabetical ordering, ultimately determining that the numerator of the probability fraction is 532.</explanation>

<explanation>The final answer "532" indicates that the solver performed probability calculations correctly. They would have needed to calculate the probability of various transmission error scenarios and determine when Sa would come alphabetically before Sb.

<explanation>To arrive at "532" as the answer, the solver must have created a mathematical model of the letter transmission process, including the 1/3 probability of error for each letter and the independence of these errors.

<explanation>To solve this problem, the solver would have needed to consider all possible received strings when "aaa" and "bbb" are transmitted with a 1/3 error probability. This involves combinatorial analysis to enumerate all possible outcomes and their probabilities, ultimately leading to the answer "532".</explanation>
