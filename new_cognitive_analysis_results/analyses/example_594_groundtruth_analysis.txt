Problem:
One hundred concentric circles with radii $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100$ are drawn in a plane. The interior of the circle of radius 1 is colored red, and each region bounded by consecutive circles is colored either red or green, with no two adjacent regions the same color. The ratio of the total area of the green regions to the area of the circle of radius 100 can be expressed as $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n.$

<explanation>While the thinking trajectory is extremely brief (just the answer "301"), it implies that the solver correctly interpreted the problem about concentric circles with alternating red and green regions. The solver understood that they needed to find the ratio of green area to the total area, express it as a fraction m/n in lowest terms, and then calculate m+n. The correct answer of 301 indicates successful problem interpretation.</explanation>

<text>301</text>
<explanation>Though not explicitly shown in the trajectory, arriving at the correct answer implies the solver visualized the concentric circles and understood the alternating pattern of red and green regions. This requires spatial reasoning to mentally represent the circular regions and their coloring pattern.</explanation>

<start>0</start>
<end>301</end>
<text>301</text>
<explanation>Reaching the answer 301 suggests the solver recognized the pattern of alternating colors and understood how this pattern affects the calculation of areas. They likely recognized that the green regions would form a pattern that could be expressed mathematically.</explanation>

<end>301</end>
<text>301</text>
<explanation>The answer 301 implies the solver found the ratio as a fraction m/n in lowest terms (where m and n are relatively prime) and then calculated m+n=301. This requires the skill of fraction simplification to express the ratio in its simplest form.</explanation>

<explanation>To solve this problem correctly, the solver needed to calculate the areas of circular regions. The answer 301 suggests they correctly applied the formula for the area of a circle (πr²) to calculate the areas of the various regions.</explanation>
