Problem:
Twenty five of King Arthur's knights are seated at their customary round table. Three of them are chosen - all choices being equally likely - and are sent off to slay a troublesome dragon. Let $P$ be the probability that at least two of the three had been sitting next to each other. If $P$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator? 

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the probability that at least two of the three chosen knights were sitting next to each other at a round table of 25 knights.

Total number of ways to choose 3 knights from 25 is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.
Total number of ways to choose 3 knights from 25 is $\binom{25}{3} = \frac{25 \times 24 \times 23}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 25 \times 4 \times 23 = 100 \times 23 = 2300$.
This is the size of the sample space.

Now, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 knights such that at least two of them were sitting next to each other. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Exactly two of the chosen knights were sitting next to each other.
2. All three of the chosen knights were sitting next to each other.

Case 1: Exactly two of the chosen knights were sitting next to each other.
Consider a pair of adjacent knights. There are 25 such pairs at a round table (since the table is round).
Let the adjacent pair be $(K_i, K_{i+1})$, where the indices are taken modulo 25.
We need to choose a third knight such that this third knight is not adjacent to the chosen pair.

Consider an adjacent pair of knights. The number of such pairs is 25.
Once a pair of adjacent knights is chosen, say $(K_1, K_2)$, we need to choose a third knight from the remaining $25 - 2 = 23$ knights.
The third knight cannot be $K_{25}$ (adjacent to $K_1$) or $K_3$ (adjacent to $K_2$).
So, the third knight can be any of the $23 - 2 = 21$ remaining knights.
Number of ways to choose a pair of adjacent knights is 25.
For each such pair, there are 21 choices for the third knight such that exactly two are adjacent.
Number of sets of 3 knights with exactly two adjacent = $25 \times 21 = 525$.

Let's verify this reasoning.
Consider the groups of three chosen knights where exactly two are adjacent. These groups look like $(K_i, K_{i+1}, K_j)$ where $j \neq i-1, i, i+1, i+2$.
The adjacent pair can be $(K_1, K_2), (K_2, K_3), ..., (K_{25}, K_1)$.
If the adjacent pair is $(K_1, K_2)$, the third knight cannot be $K_{25}$ or $K_3$. The possible choices for the third knight are $K_4, K_5, ..., K_{23}, K_{24}$, which are $24 - 4 + 1 = 21$ choices.
Since there are 25 adjacent pairs, the number of such triples is $25 \times 21 = 525$.

Case 2: All three of the chosen knights were sitting next to each other.
These are sets of the form $(K_i, K_{i+1}, K_{i+2})$, where the indices are modulo 25.
The possible sets are $(K_1, K_2, K_3), (K_2, K_3, K_4), ..., (K_{23}, K_{24}, K_{25}), (K_{24}, K_{25}, K_1), (K_{25}, K_1, K_2)$.
There are 25 such sets of three consecutive knights.

The number of ways to choose 3 knights such that at least two are adjacent is the sum of the number of ways for Case 1 and Case 2.
Number of ways = $525 + 25 = 550$.

The probability $P$ is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.
$P = \frac{550}{2300} = \frac{55}{230} = \frac{11}{46}$.

The probability $P = \frac{11}{46}$.
The fraction is in lowest terms since 11 is prime and 46 is not divisible by 11.

The sum of the numerator and denominator is $11 + 46 = 57$.

Let's try an alternative approach by directly counting the number of triples with at least two adjacent knights.

Consider a block of two adjacent knights. There are 25 such blocks.
If we choose such a block, say $(K_1, K_2)$, the third knight can be any of the remaining 23.
This gives $25 \times 23 = 575$ combinations.

However, this counts the triples where all three are adjacent multiple times.
Consider the triple $(K_1, K_2, K_3)$. It is counted when the pair is $(K_1, K_2)$ and the third is $K_3$, and when the pair is $(K_2, K_3)$ and the third is $K_1$.

Let the chosen knights be $A, B, C$.
Case 1: Exactly two are adjacent.
Pairs of adjacent knights: $(1, 2), (2, 3), ..., (24, 25), (25, 1)$.
Consider the pair $(1, 2)$. The third knight can be any $k \notin \{25, 1, 2, 3\}$.
Third knight can be $4, 5, ..., 24$, which are $24 - 4 + 1 = 21$ options.
Number of triples with exactly $(1, 2)$ adjacent = 21.
Total number of such triples = $25 \times 21 = 525$.

Case 2: All three are adjacent.
Triples of adjacent knights: $(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), ..., (23, 24, 25), (24, 25, 1), (25, 1, 2)$.
There are 25 such triples.

Total number of triples with at least two adjacent = $525 + 25 = 550$.

Alternative method: Complementary probability.
Probability that none of the three chosen knights are adjacent.
We need to choose 3 knights such that no two are adjacent.

Consider placing the 22 unchosen knights in a row. This creates 23 spaces where the chosen knights can be placed (including the ends).
_ K _ K _ ... _ K _
There are 23 spaces to place the 3 chosen knights.
Number of ways to choose 3 non-adjacent items from $n$ items arranged in a circle.

Consider a linear arrangement first. Number of ways to choose $k$ non-adjacent items from $n$ items in a row is $\binom{n-k+1}{k}$.
Here, $n=25, k=3$.
If the knights were in a row, number of ways to choose 3 non-adjacent knights = $\binom{25-3+1}{3} = \binom{23}{3} = \frac{23 \times 22 \times 21}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 23 \times 11 \times 7 = 253 \times 7 = 1771$.

For a circular arrangement, the formula is $\frac{n}{n-k} \binom{n-k}{k}$.
Here, $n=25, k=3$.
Number of ways to choose 3 non-adjacent knights from 25 in a circle = $\frac{25}{25-3} \binom{25-3}{3} = \frac{25}{22} \binom{22}{3} = \frac{25}{22} \times \frac{22 \times 21 \times 20}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 25 \times 7 \times 10 = 1750$.

Probability that none of the three chosen knights are adjacent = $\frac{1750}{2300} = \frac{175}{230} = \frac{35}{46}$.

Probability that at least two are adjacent = $1 - P(\text{none are adjacent}) = 1 - \frac{35}{46} = \frac{46 - 35}{46} = \frac{11}{46}$.

This confirms the previous result.

Let's double-check the formula for choosing non-adjacent items in a circle.
Consider $n$ items in a circle. We want to choose $k$ non-adjacent items.
Consider the complementary problem: choosing $k$ items such that no two are consecutive.

Let the chosen items be $x_1, x_2, ..., x_k$.
Let the number of items between $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$ be $y_i \ge 1$.
Number of items between $x_k$ and $x_1$ is $y_k \ge 1$.
$y_1 + y_2 + ... + y_k = n - k$.

Consider the linear case first. Choose $k$ non-adjacent from $n$.
Represent chosen by C, not chosen by N.
Example: N C N C N N C N
Let $y_i$ be the number of non-chosen items between the $i$-th and $(i+1)$-th chosen item.
Let $z_0$ be the number of non-chosen items before the first chosen item.
Let $z_k$ be the number of non-chosen items after the last chosen item.
$z_0 \ge 0, z_k \ge 0, y_i \ge 1$ for $i=1, ..., k-1$.
$z_0 + y_1 + y_2 + ... + y_{k-1} + z_k = n - k$.
Let $w_i = y_i - 1 \ge 0$.
$z_0 + (w_1+1) + ... + (w_{k-1}+1) + z_k = n - k$.
$z_0 + w_1 + ... + w_{k-1} + z_k = n - k - (k-1) = n - 2k + 1$.
Number of non-negative integer solutions = $\binom{(n - 2k + 1) + (k+1) - 1}{(k+1) - 1} = \binom{n - k + 1}{k}$. This is for the linear case.

Circular case:
Consider $n$ items in a circle, choose $k$ non-adjacent.
Fix one chosen item. The remaining $k-1$ chosen items are to be chosen from the remaining $n-1$ items such that no two are adjacent and none are adjacent to the first chosen item.
Consider the $n-1$ items in a row. Remove the two neighbors of the first chosen item.
We need to choose $k-1$ non-adjacent items from the remaining $n-3$ items.
This seems complicated.

Let's use the gap method for the circular case directly.
Place $n-k$ unchosen items in a circle. This creates $n-k$ gaps between them.
We need to choose $k$ of these gaps to place the chosen items.
Number of ways = $\binom{n-k}{k}$. This is incorrect.

Consider the arrangement of $n-k$ unchosen items in a circle.
Imagine the $k$ chosen items are placed in the $n-k$ spaces between them.
This requires that each chosen item is separated by at least one unchosen item.

Let the chosen items be nodes, separated by groups of unchosen items.
Let $x_i$ be the number of unchosen items between the $i$-th and $(i+1)$-th chosen item.
$x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k = n - k$, where $x_i \ge 1$.
Let $y_i = x_i - 1 \ge 0$.
$y_1 + 1 + y_2 + 1 + ... + y_k + 1 = n - k$.
$y_1 + y_2 + ... + y_k = n - k - k = n - 2k$.
Number of non-negative integer solutions = $\binom{(n - 2k) + k - 1}{k - 1} = \binom{n - k - 1}{k - 1}$.

This is the number of ways to choose $k$ non-adjacent items from $n$ in a circle.
Let's check the formula used earlier: $\frac{n}{n-k} \binom{n-k}{k}$.
$\frac{n}{n-k} \frac{(n-k)!}{k!(n-2k)!} = \frac{n (n-k-1)!}{k!(n-2k)!}$.

Consider the problem of placing $k$ identical balls into $n-k$ distinct boxes, with each box having at most 1 ball. This is $\binom{n-k}{k}$.

Let's use a simpler example.
$n=4$, choose $k=2$ non-adjacent.
Linear: $\binom{4-2+1}{2} = \binom{3}{2} = 3$. (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)
Circular: $\binom{4-2-1}{2-1} = \binom{1}{1} = 1$. (1,3)

Using the formula: $\frac{4}{4-2} \binom{4-2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} \binom{2}{2} = 2 \times 1 = 2$.

The formula seems incorrect.

Let's verify the complementary counting method.
Total ways to choose 3 knights = $\binom{25}{3} = 2300$.
Number of ways to choose 3 non-adjacent knights.

Consider the gaps between the chosen knights. Let the chosen knights divide the remaining 22 knights into 3 groups of sizes $x, y, z$.
$x+y+z = 22$, $x \ge 1, y \ge 1, z \ge 1$.
Let $x' = x-1, y' = y-1, z' = z-1 \ge 0$.
$x'+1 + y'+1 + z'+1 = 22 \implies x'+y'+z' = 19$.
Number of non-negative integer solutions = $\binom{19+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{21}{2} = \frac{21 \times 20}{2} = 210$.

This assumes a linear arrangement.

Consider the arrangement of 22 unchosen knights in a circle.
We need to choose 3 spaces between them to place the chosen knights.
Number of spaces = 22.
Number of ways to choose 3 spaces = $\binom{22}{3} = \frac{22 \times 21 \times 20}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 11 \times 7 \times 20 = 1540$.

This is still not correct.

Let's use the formula for selecting $k$ non-consecutive items from $n$ in a circle.
Number of ways = $\frac{n}{n-k} \binom{n-k}{k}$.

Consider the case of choosing 3 non-adjacent from 5.
Total ways = $\binom{5}{3} = 10$.
Triples: (1,2,3), (1,2,4), (1,2,5), (1,3,4), (1,3,5), (1,4,5), (2,3,4), (2,3,5), (2,4,5), (3,4,5).
Adjacent pairs: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,1).
Adjacent triples: (1,2,3), (2,3,4), (3,4,5), (4,5,1), (5,1,2).

Non-adjacent triples: (1,3,5). Only 1.
Formula: $\frac{5}{5-3} \binom{5-3}{3} = \frac{5}{2} \binom{2}{3} = 0$.

Let's use the complementary counting method carefully.
Total ways to choose 3 knights = $\binom{25}{3} = 2300$.
Number of ways to choose 3 knights such that no two are adjacent.

Consider a selection of 3 knights. There are $\binom{25}{3}$ total selections.
Consider the number of selections where at least two are adjacent.
Pairs of adjacent knights: 25.
For each pair, choose a third knight not adjacent to the pair.
Pair $(K_i, K_{i+1})$. Third knight cannot be $K_{i-1}$ or $K_{i+2}$.
If the pair is $(1, 2)$, third cannot be 25 or 3.
The third knight can be chosen from the remaining $25 - 4 = 21$ knights.
Number of triples with exactly one adjacent pair = $25 \times 21 = 525$.

Triples of adjacent knights: 25.
Total number of triples with at least two adjacent = $525$ (exactly 2 adjacent) $+ 25$ (all 3 adjacent) $= 550$.

Probability = $\frac{550}{2300} = \frac{55}{230} = \frac{11}{46}$.

Sum of numerator and denominator = $11 + 46 = 57$.

Double-checking the calculation.
Total number of ways to choose 3 knights = $\binom{25}{3} = 2300$.
Number of ways to choose 3 knights such that they are consecutive: 25.
Number of ways to choose 3 knights such that exactly two are consecutive.
Choose a block of two consecutive knights (25 ways).
Choose a third knight not adjacent to this block (21 ways).
Total = $25 \times 21 = 525$.

The events are disjoint.
Number of ways with at least two adjacent = $525 + 25 = 550$.
Probability = $\frac{550}{2300} = \frac{11}{46}$.

The sum of the numerator and denominator is $11 + 46 = 57$.
The fraction $\frac{11}{46}$ is in lowest terms since gcd(11, 46) = 1.

Consider a pair of adjacent knights. There are 25 such pairs at a round table (since the table is round).
Let the adjacent pair be $(K_i, K_{i+1})$, where the indices are taken modulo 25.
We need to choose a third knight such that this third knight is not adjacent to the chosen pair.

Consider an adjacent pair of knights. The number of such pairs is 25.
Once a pair of adjacent knights is chosen, say $(K_1, K_2)$, we need to choose a third knight from the remaining $25 - 2 = 23$ knights.
The third knight cannot be $K_{25}$ (adjacent to $K_1$) or $K_3$ (adjacent to $K_2$).
So, the third knight can be any of the $23 - 2 = 21$ remaining knights.
Number of ways to choose a pair of adjacent knights is 25.
For each such pair, there are 21 choices for the third knight such that exactly two are adjacent.
Number of sets of 3 knights with exactly two adjacent = $25 \times 21 = 525$.</text>

If the adjacent pair is $(K_1, K_2)$, the third knight cannot be $K_{25}$ or $K_3$. The possible choices for the third knight are $K_4, K_5, ..., K_{23}, K_{24}$, which are $24 - 4 + 1 = 21$ choices.
Since there are 25 adjacent pairs, the number of such triples is $25 \times 21 = 525$.

Case 2: All three of the chosen knights were sitting next to each other.
These are sets of the form $(K_i, K_{i+1}, K_{i+2})$, where the indices are modulo 25.
