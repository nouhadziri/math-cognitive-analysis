<text>791</text>
<explanation>The solver has represented the problem by immediately providing the answer "791". This indicates they have successfully translated the problem about four numbers and their pairwise sums into a mathematical representation that allowed them to determine the maximum possible value of x+y. While we don't see the detailed steps, the presence of a specific numerical answer shows they established a clear mathematical representation of the problem.</explanation>

<skill>Numerical Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to work with numbers and perform calculations to derive solutions, including arithmetic operations, algebraic manipulations, and numerical pattern recognition.</definition>

<text>791</text>
<explanation>The solver has performed numerical reasoning to arrive at the specific value 791. This indicates they worked with the given pairwise sums (189, 320, 287, 234) and determined what values of x and y would maximize their sum. This requires numerical manipulation and calculation to determine the underlying four numbers in the set and then calculate the maximum possible sum of the remaining two pairwise sums.</explanation>

<skill>System of Equations Solving</skill>
<definition>The ability to formulate and solve multiple equations with multiple unknowns, identifying constraints and determining values that satisfy all conditions simultaneously.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>791</text>
<explanation>Though not explicitly shown in the brief solution, arriving at 791 requires setting up and solving a system of equations. With four unknown numbers and six pairwise sums (four of which are given), the solver needed to create equations representing these sums and solve them simultaneously to determine the original four numbers, which then allows calculation of x and y.</explanation>

<skill>Optimization</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify maximum or minimum values subject to given constraints, including determining extreme values and optimal solutions.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>791</text>
<explanation>The problem asks for the "greatest possible value" of x+y, which is an optimization problem. The solver has successfully determined the maximum possible sum (791) that satisfies all the constraints of the problem. This requires understanding which configuration of the four original numbers would yield the maximum sum for the remaining two pairwise sums.</explanation>

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify regularities, structures, or relationships in mathematical contexts, allowing for efficient problem-solving approaches.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>791</text>
<explanation>To arrive at 791, the solver likely recognized patterns in the given pairwise sums that helped determine the underlying structure of the four original numbers. Pattern recognition would be essential to efficiently solve this problem rather than using trial and error, as the solver needed to identify how the six pairwise sums relate to the four original numbers.</explanation>
