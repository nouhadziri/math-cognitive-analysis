Problem:
Let  $a,b,A,B$  be given reals. We consider the function defined by \[ f(x) = 1 - a \cdot \cos(x) - b \cdot \sin(x) - A \cdot \cos(2x) - B \cdot \sin(2x). \] Prove that if for any real number  $x$  we have  $f(x) \geq 0$  then  $a^2 + b^2 \leq 2$  and  $A^2 + B^2 \leq 1.$ 

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Rewrite the function using trigonometric identities:**
   \[
   f(x) = 1 - a \cos(x) - b \sin(x) - A \cos(2x) - B \sin(2x)
   \]
   We can use the angle addition formulas for sine and cosine:
   \[
   \cos(x + \theta) = \cos(x)\cos(\theta) - \sin(x)\sin(\theta)
   \]
   \[
   \sin(x + \theta) = \sin(x)\cos(\theta) + \cos(x)\sin(\theta)
   \]
   Let:
   \[
   R_1 = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}, \quad \theta_1 = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
   \]
   \[
   R_2 = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}, \quad \theta_2 = \arctan\left(\frac{B}{A}\right)
   \]
   Then:
   \[
   a \cos(x) + b \sin(x) = R_1 \sin(x + \theta_1)
   \]
   \[
   A \cos(2x) + B \sin(2x) = R_2 \sin(2x + \theta_2)
   \]
   Therefore, the function becomes:
   \[
   f(x) = 1 - R_1 \sin(x + \theta_1) - R_2 \sin(2x + \theta_2)
   \]

2. **Analyze the function for non-negativity:**
   Given \( f(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x \), we need to ensure that the maximum values of the sine terms do not exceed 1:
   \[
   1 - R_1 \sin(x + \theta_1) - R_2 \sin(2x + \theta_2) \geq 0
   \]
   The maximum value of \( \sin(x + \theta_1) \) and \( \sin(2x + \theta_2) \) is 1. Therefore:
   \[
   1 - R_1 - R_2 \geq 0
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   R_1 + R_2 \leq 1
   \]

3. **Consider the individual terms:**
   Since \( R_1 = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( R_2 = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \), we need to show:
   \[
   \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \leq 1
   \]

4. **Prove the inequalities:**
   - For \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 1 \):
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 \leq 1^2 = 1
     \]
   - For \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \leq 1 \):
     \[
     A^2 + B^2 \leq 1^2 = 1
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Therefore, we have shown that if \( f(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x \), then:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 \leq 2 \quad \text{and} \quad A^2 + B^2 \leq 1
   \]

\(\blacksquare\)

The final answer is \( \boxed{ a^2 + b^2 \leq 2 } \) and \( A^2 + B^2 \leq 1 \)

   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver introduces substitutions using polar form, converting linear combinations of sine and cosine into amplitude-phase form. This is a sophisticated reformulation that simplifies the expression by consolidating terms, showing deep understanding of trigonometric relationships and strategic transformation of the problem.</explanation>

<start>747</start>
<end>865</end>
<text>   Therefore, the function becomes:
   \[
   f(x) = 1 - R_1 \sin(x + \theta_1) - R_2 \sin(2x + \theta_2)
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver completes the reformulation by expressing the original function in terms of the new variables, creating a more compact and analyzable form. This demonstrates the ability to follow through with a mathematical transformation and verify its correctness.</explanation>

   R_1 = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}, \quad \theta_1 = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
   \]
   \[
   R_2 = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}, \quad \theta_2 = \arctan\left(\frac{B}{A}\right)
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver strategically introduces amplitude-phase parameters (R₁, θ₁, R₂, θ₂) that convert the problem from Cartesian to polar form.

   \]
   \[
   A \cos(2x) + B \sin(2x) = R_2 \sin(2x + \theta_2)
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that the linear combinations of sine and cosine terms follow a pattern that can be expressed as single sine waves with adjusted amplitudes and phase shifts.

<start>865</start>
<end>1193</end>
<text>2. **Analyze the function for non-negativity:**
   Given \( f(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x \), we need to ensure that the maximum values of the sine terms do not exceed 1:
   \[
   1 - R_1 \sin(x + \theta_1) - R_2 \sin(2x + \theta_2) \geq 0
   \]
   The maximum value of \( \sin(x + \theta_1) \) and \( \sin(2x + \theta_2) \) is 1. Therefore:
   \[
   1 - R_1 - R_2 \geq 0
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   R_1 + R_2 \leq 1
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes the non-negativity constraint by considering the extreme values of the sine functions. By recognizing that sine functions are bounded between -1 and 1, and identifying the worst-case scenario where both sine terms reach their maximum value of 1 simultaneously, they establish a necessary condition for the function to remain non-negative.</explanation>

<skill>Logical Deduction</skill>
<definition>The ability to draw valid conclusions from given premises through step-by-step reasoning, following rules of inference to arrive at logically sound results.</definition>

<start>1193</start>

<text>3. **Consider the individual terms:**
   Since \( R_1 = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( R_2 = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \), we need to show:
   \[
   \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \leq 1
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver uses logical deduction to connect the condition R₁ + R₂ ≤ 1 back to the original parameters a, b, A, and B. They correctly identify that this implies constraints on the magnitudes of these parameters, expressed as inequalities involving the square roots.</explanation>

<start>1355</start>
<end>1537</end>
<text>4. **Prove the inequalities:**
   - For \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 1 \):
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 \leq 1^2 = 1
     \]
   - For \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \leq 1 \):
     \[
     A^2 + B^2 \leq 1^2 = 1
     \]</text>
<explanation>The solver applies logical deduction to square both sides of the inequalities, preserving the direction of the inequality since the square function is monotonically increasing for positive values. This transforms the constraints into the form requested in the problem statement.</explanation>

<skill>Critical Evaluation of Results</skill>
<definition>The ability to assess whether obtained results are correct, complete, and aligned with the original problem requirements, including checking for consistency and ensuring all conditions are satisfied.</definition>

<start>1537</start>
<end>1696</end>
<text>5. **Conclusion:**
   Therefore, we have shown that if \( f(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x \), then:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 \leq 2 \quad \text{and} \quad A^2 + B^2 \leq 1
   \]

\(\blacksquare\)</text>
<explanation>The solver evaluates their final result, ensuring it addresses the original problem statement. However, there appears to be an inconsistency in the conclusion, as earlier work suggested a^2 + b^2 ≤ 1, but the conclusion states a^2 + b^2 ≤ 2. This suggests either an error in the solution process or missing steps in the reasoning that would justify this change.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Insight</skill>
<definition>The ability to perceive deeper mathematical structures or relationships that are not immediately obvious, often leading to elegant solutions or shortcuts in problem-solving.</definition>

<start>450</start>
<end>865</end>
<text>   Let:
   \[
   R_1 = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}, \quad \theta_1 = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
   \]
   \[
   R_2 = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}, \quad \theta_2 = \arctan\left(\frac{B}{A}\right)
   \]
   Then:
   \[
   a \cos(x) + b \sin(x) = R_1 \sin(x + \theta_1)
   \]
   \[
   A \cos(2x) + B \sin(2x) = R_2 \sin(2x + \theta_2)
   \]
   Therefore, the function becomes:
   \[
   f(x) = 1 - R_1 \sin(x + \theta_1) - R_2 \sin(2x + \theta_2)
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates mathematical insight by recognizing that the key to solving this problem lies in rewriting the function using amplitude-phase form. This transformation reveals that the behavior of the function is fundamentally determined by the amplitudes of the sine waves, which directly relate to the magnitudes of the original parameters. This insight provides a clear path to the solution that might not be apparent from the original formulation.</explanation>
