Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let's analyze each vector and the answer choices.

A vector can be a valid quantum state if the norm of the vector is 1.
Let's check the norm of each vector.

For W:
||W||^2 = |1/sqrt(2)|^2 + |-i/sqrt(2)|^2 = 1/2 + |-1|^2 / 2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1
So, W is a valid quantum state.

For X:
||X||^2 = |1/sqrt(3)|^2 + |i/sqrt(3)|^2 + |-i/sqrt(3)|^2 = 1/3 + |i|^2 / 3 + |-i|^2 / 3 = 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1
So, X is a valid quantum state.

For Y:
||Y||^2 = |1/2|^2 + |-1/2|^2 + |1/2|^2 + |-1/2|^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 4/4 = 1
So, Y is a valid quantum state.

For Z:
||Z||^2 = |-1/sqrt(5)|^2 + |sqrt(2/5)|^2 + |0|^2 + |sqrt(1/5)|^2 + |i/sqrt(5)|^2 = 1/5 + 2/5 + 0 + 1/5 + |i|^2 / 5 = 1/5 + 2/5 + 0 + 1/5 + 1/5 = 5/5 = 1
So, Z is a valid quantum state.

Now let's evaluate each answer choice.

(A) 2 of the vectors can be the spin states of some n-electron system for n>= 1 (potentially different number of electrons for each vector).
All four vectors are valid quantum states. A single electron has a 2-dimensional spin space. So W can be a spin state of a single electron.
A system of n electrons has a spin space of dimension 2^n.
For n=1, dimension is 2.
For n=2, dimension is 4.
For n=3, dimension is 8.
W is a 2-dimensional vector, so it can represent the spin state of a single electron.
X is a 3-dimensional vector. It cannot represent the spin state of n electrons, as the dimension must be a power of 2.
Y is a 4-dimensional vector, so it can represent the spin state of a two-electron system (2^2 = 4).
Z is a 5-dimensional vector. It cannot represent the spin state of n electrons, as the dimension must be a power of 2.
So, W and Y can be spin states of some n-electron system. Thus, this statement is correct.

(B) Y can be the spin state of a two-electron system and observing the state of one of the electrons will affect the state of the other.
For a two-electron system, the basis states are |up, up>, |up, down>, |down, up>, |down, down>.
The vector Y = (1/2, -1/2, 1/2, -1/2) can be written as a linear combination of these basis states.
Y = 1/2 |up, up> - 1/2 |up, down> + 1/2 |down, up> - 1/2 |down, down>
This state is a separable state because it can be factored into a product of single-particle states:
Y = 1/2 (|up> + |down>) x (|up> - |down>)
If the state is separable, observing the state of one electron will not instantaneously affect the state of the other.
However, let's double check the factorisation:
(a|up> + b|down>) (c|up> + d|down>) = ac|up,up> + ad|up,down> + bc|down,up> + bd|down,down>
ac = 1/2, ad = -1/2, bc = 1/2, bd = -1/2
If a=1, c=1/2, d=-1/2, b=1.
So, (1|up> + 1|down>)(1/2|up> - 1/2|down>) = 1/2|up,up> - 1/2|up,down> + 1/2|down,up> - 1/2|down,down> which is Y.
The statement says that observing the state of one of the electrons *will* affect the state of the other. This is true for entangled states. Let's check if Y is entangled. If Y can be written as a product of two single-electron states, it's separable, not entangled.
Y = 1/2(|uu> - |ud> + |du> - |dd>)
This can be written as 1/2 (|u>(|u>-|d>) + |d>(|u>-|d>)) = 1/2 (|u>+|d>)(|u>-|d>).
So Y is separable, and observing one electron does not instantaneously affect the other. Thus, this statement is incorrect.

(C) Z can be the spin state of qubit-qutrit quantum system.
A qubit is a 2-dimensional quantum system. A qutrit is a 3-dimensional quantum system.
The combined system of a qubit and a qutrit has a dimension of 2 * 3 = 6.
Z is a 5-dimensional vector. Therefore, Z cannot be the spin state of a qubit-qutrit system. This statement is incorrect.

(D) W can be the spin state of a quantum system of two fermions.
A system of two fermions must have an antisymmetric wavefunction.
The spin states for two fermions are |up, down> - |down, up> (singlet, antisymmetric) and the triplet states |up, up>, |up, down> + |down, up>, |down, down> (symmetric).
W is a 2-dimensional vector. The spin state of two fermions exists in a 4-dimensional space.
However, the question might be interpreted as if W represents the spin state of a single fermion (like an electron). A single fermion has a 2-dimensional spin space.
If W represents a single fermion, it's valid.
If W represents two fermions, its dimension is wrong.
Given the phrasing "the spin state of a quantum system of two fermions", it implies that W itself is the combined spin state.
The dimension of the spin state for two fermions is 4. The dimension of W is 2.
So, W cannot represent the spin state of a system of two fermions. This statement is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate option A.
W can be the spin state of a single electron (n=1).
Y can be the spin state of a two-electron system (n=2).
So, 2 of the vectors (W and Y) can be the spin states of some n-electron system for n>= 1.

Final check of the answer choices.
(A) seems correct.
(B) is incorrect because Y is separable.
(C) is incorrect because the dimensions don't match.
(D) is incorrect because the dimensions don't match for a two-fermion system.

A system of n electrons has a spin space of dimension 2^n.

<explanation>The solver demonstrates dimensional analysis by correctly identifying the relationship between the number of electrons and the dimension of the corresponding spin space (2^n). They then apply this knowledge to determine which vectors could represent valid electron spin states based on their dimensions.</explanation>

<start>1491</start>
<end>1641</end>
<text>X is a 3-dimensional vector. It cannot represent the spin state of n electrons, as the dimension must be a power of 2.
Y is a 4-dimensional vector, so it can represent the spin state of a two-electron system (2^2 = 4).</text>
<explanation>Here the solver continues the dimensional analysis, correctly identifying that X cannot represent an electron spin state because its dimension (3) is not a power of 2, while Y can represent a two-electron system because its dimension (4) equals 2^2.</explanation>

<end>2394</end>
<text>For a two-electron system, the basis states are |up, up>, |up, down>, |down, up>, |down, down>.
The vector Y = (1/2, -1/2, 1/2, -1/2) can be written as a linear combination of these basis states.
Y = 1/2 |up, up> - 1/2 |up, down> + 1/2 |down, up> - 1/2 |down, down>
This state is a separable state because it can be factored into a product of single-particle states:
Y = 1/2 (|up> + |down>) x (|up> - |down>)</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates understanding of tensor products by correctly identifying the basis states for a two-electron system and analyzing whether vector Y can be factored into a product of single-particle states.

<start>2395</start>
<end>2756</end>
<text>If the state is separable, observing the state of one electron will not instantaneously affect the state of the other.
However, let's double check the factorisation:
(a|up> + b|down>) (c|up> + d|down>) = ac|up,up> + ad|up,down> + bc|down,up> + bd|down,down>
ac = 1/2, ad = -1/2, bc = 1/2, bd = -1/2
If a=1, c=1/2, d=-1/2, b=1.</text>
<explanation>The solver shows deeper understanding of tensor products by verifying the factorization of state Y through algebraic manipulation.

<definition>The ability to determine whether quantum states are entangled or separable, and understand the physical implications of entanglement for measurement outcomes.</definition>

<start>2757</start>
<end>3276</end>
<text>So, (1|up> + 1|down>)(1/2|up> - 1/2|down>) = 1/2|up,up> - 1/2|up,down> + 1/2|down,up> - 1/2|down,down> which is Y.
The statement says that observing the state of one of the electrons *will* affect the state of the other. This is true for entangled states. Let's check if Y is entangled. If Y can be written as a product of two single-electron states, it's separable, not entangled.
Y = 1/2(|uu> - |ud> + |du> - |dd>)
This can be written as 1/2 (|u>(|u>-|d>) + |d>(|u>-|d>)) = 1/2 (|u>+|d>)(|u>-|d>).
So Y is separable, and observing one electron does not instantaneously affect the other.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes whether state Y exhibits quantum entanglement by checking if it can be factored into a product of individual states. They correctly determine that Y is separable (not entangled) and understand the physical implication: measuring one electron will not affect the other.</explanation>

<definition>The ability to understand how different quantum systems combine to form composite systems, including knowledge of how dimensions combine and constraints on valid physical representations.</definition>

<start>3306</start>

A qubit is a 2-dimensional quantum system. A qutrit is a 3-dimensional quantum system.
The combined system of a qubit and a qutrit has a dimension of 2 * 3 = 6.
Z is a 5-dimensional vector. Therefore, Z cannot be the spin state of a qubit-qutrit system.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates understanding of quantum system composition by correctly identifying that a qubit-qutrit system would have dimension 2×3=6, and therefore vector Z (dimension 5) cannot represent such a system. This shows knowledge of how dimensions combine in composite quantum systems.</explanation>

W can be the spin state of a single electron (n=1).
Y can be the spin state of a two-electron system (n=2).
So, 2 of the vectors (W and Y) can be the spin states of some n-electron system for n>= 1.

Final check of the answer choices.
(A) seems correct.
