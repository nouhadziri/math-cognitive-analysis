Problem:
Mike draws five cards from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that he draws a card from at least three of the four suits? Express your answer as a simplified fraction.

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
We calculate the probability that he does not draw a card from at least three of the suits. To do this, we calculate the number of sets of 5 cards from at most two suits and divide by $\binom{52}5$, the number of sets of 5 cards. Since there are $\binom42=6$ choices for the two suits, and $\binom{26}5$ ways to choose 5 cards from the 26 in those two suits, our answer would appear to be $6\binom{26}5$. But this triple-counts the ways to choose the cards from a single suit: 5 hearts is included in 5 (hearts and spades), 5 (hearts and clubs), and 5 (hearts and diamonds). So we subtract twice the number of ways to choose cards from a single suit: $6\binom{26}5-2\cdot4\binom{13}5$. We divide this by $\binom{52}5$ to get $$\frac{6\cdot26\cdot25\cdot24\cdot23\cdot22-8\cdot13\cdot12\cdot11\cdot10\cdot9}{52\cdot51\cdot50\cdot49\cdot48}=\frac{88}{595}.$$Therefore, the probability that he draws three or four of the suits is $1-\frac{88}{595}=\boxed{\frac{507}{595}}$.

# Analysis of Cognitive Skills in Mathematical Problem-Solving

<skill>Complementary Counting</skill>
<definition>The strategy of calculating the probability of an event by finding the probability of its complement (the event not occurring) and subtracting from 1. This is often used when the complement is easier to calculate.</definition>

<text>We calculate the probability that he does not draw a card from at least three of the suits. To do this, we calculate the number of sets of 5 cards from at most two suits and divide by $\binom{52}5$, the number of sets of 5 cards.</text>
<explanation>The solver immediately recognizes that finding cases where cards come from at least 3 suits is complex, so they switch to calculating the complement: cases where cards come from at most 2 suits. This demonstrates the complementary counting strategy, which simplifies the problem.</explanation>

<start>506</start>
<end>595</end>
<text>Therefore, the probability that he draws three or four of the suits is $1-\frac{88}{595}=\boxed{\frac{507}{595}}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver completes the complementary counting approach by subtracting the probability of the complement (cards from at most 2 suits) from 1 to find the desired probability.</explanation>

<skill>Combinatorial Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to systematically count and analyze different arrangements and selections of objects, often using combinations and permutations to enumerate possibilities.</definition>

<text>Since there are $\binom42=6$ choices for the two suits, and $\binom{26}5$ ways to choose 5 cards from the 26 in those two suits, our answer would appear to be $6\binom{26}5$.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses combinatorial reasoning to count the number of ways to select 2 suits from 4 possible suits, and then the number of ways to select 5 cards from those 26 cards (13 cards in each of the 2 suits).</explanation>

<start>393</start>
<end>505</end>
<text>We divide this by $\binom{52}5$ to get $$\frac{6\cdot26\cdot25\cdot24\cdot23\cdot22-8\cdot13\cdot12\cdot11\cdot10\cdot9}{52\cdot51\cdot50\cdot49\cdot48}=\frac{88}{595}.$$</text>
<explanation>The solver applies combinatorial reasoning to calculate the total number of possible 5-card hands from a 52-card deck, and uses this as the denominator in the probability calculation.</explanation>

<skill>Double Counting Correction</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and correct for cases that have been counted multiple times in a combinatorial calculation, ensuring accurate enumeration.</definition>

<start>248</start>
<end>393</end>
<text>But this triple-counts the ways to choose the cards from a single suit: 5 hearts is included in 5 (hearts and spades), 5 (hearts and clubs), and 5 (hearts and diamonds). So we subtract twice the number of ways to choose cards from a single suit: $6\binom{26}5-2\cdot4\binom{13}5$.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that their initial calculation counts some cases multiple times (specifically, hands with all cards from a single suit are counted three times). They then correct this by subtracting the appropriate number of overcounted cases, demonstrating an understanding of the inclusion-exclusion principle and attention to avoiding double counting.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to manipulate mathematical expressions and equations to simplify or transform them into more useful forms.</definition>

<start>393</start>

<text>We divide this by $\binom{52}5$ to get $$\frac{6\cdot26\cdot25\cdot24\cdot23\cdot22-8\cdot13\cdot12\cdot11\cdot10\cdot9}{52\cdot51\cdot50\cdot49\cdot48}=\frac{88}{595}.$$</text>
<explanation>The solver expands the binomial coefficients into factorial expressions and performs algebraic manipulations to simplify the fraction to its reduced form of 88/595.</explanation>

<start>506</start>
<end>595</end>
<text>Therefore, the probability that he draws three or four of the suits is $1-\frac{88}{595}=\boxed{\frac{507}{595}}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver performs the algebraic operation of subtracting the fraction 88/595 from 1 to get the final answer of 507/595.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver breaks down the problem into multiple steps: first calculating the total number of possible hands, then finding the number of hands with cards from at most two suits, and finally calculating the probability.</explanation>
