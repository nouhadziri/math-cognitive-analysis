Problem:
Consider the function $f: \mathbb{N}_{0} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_{0}$, where $\mathbb{N}_{0}$ is the set of all non-negative integers, defined by the following conditions: (i) $f(0)=0$, (ii) $f(2n)=2f(n)$ and (iii) $f(2n+1)=n+2f(n)$ for all $n \geq 0$. (a) Determine the three sets $L:=\{n \mid f(n)<f(n+1)\}, E:=\{n \mid f(n)=f(n+1)\}$, and $G:=\{n \mid f(n)>f(n+1)\}$ (b) For each $k \geq 0$, find a formula for $a_{k}:=\max \{f(n): 0 \leq n \leq 2^{k}\}$ in terms of $k$.

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
(a) Let $L_{1}:=\{2k: k>0\}, \quad E_{1}:=\{0\} \cup\{4k+1: k \geq 0\}, \quad \text { and } \quad G_{1}:=\{4k+3: k \geq 0\}$. We will show that $L_{1}=L, E_{1}=E$, and $G_{1}=G$. It suffices to verify that $L_{1} \subseteq E, E_{1} \subseteq E$, and $G_{1} \subseteq G$ because $L_{1}, E_{1}$, and $G_{1}$ are mutually disjoint and $L_{1} \cup E_{1} \cup G_{1}=\mathbb{N}_{0}$. Firstly, if $k>0$, then $f(2k)-f(2k+1)=-k<0$ and therefore $L_{1} \subseteq L$. Secondly, $f(0)=0$ and $f(4k+1)=2k+2f(2k)=2k+4f(k)$ and $f(4k+2)=2f(2k+1)=2(k+2f(k))=2k+4f(k)$ for all $k \geq 0$. Thus, $E_{1} \subseteq E$. Lastly, in order to prove $G_{1} \subset G$, we claim that $f(n+1)-f(n) \leq n$ for all $n$. (In fact, one can prove a stronger inequality : $f(n+1)-f(n) \leq n / 2$.) This is clearly true for even $n$ from the definition since for $n=2t$, $f(2t+1)-f(2t)=t \leq n$. If $n=2t+1$ is odd, then (assuming inductively that the result holds for all nonnegative $m<n$ ), we have $f(n+1)-f(n) =f(2t+2)-f(2t+1)=2f(t+1)-t-2f(t) =2(f(t+1)-f(t))-t \leq 2t-t=t<n$. For all $k \geq 0$, $f(4k+4)-f(4k+3)=f(2(2k+2))-f(2(2k+1)+1) =4f(k+1)-(2k+1+2f(2k+1))=4f(k+1)-(2k+1+2k+4f(k)) =4(f(k+1)-f(k))-(4k+1) \leq 4k-(4k+1)<0$. This proves $G_{1} \subseteq G$. (b) Note that $a_{0}=a_{1}=f(1)=0$. Let $k \geq 2$ and let $N_{k}=\{0,1,2, \ldots, 2^{k}\}$. First we claim that the maximum $a_{k}$ occurs at the largest number in $G \cap N_{k}$, that is, $a_{k}=f(2^{k}-1)$. We use mathematical induction on $k$ to prove the claim. Note that $a_{2}=f(3)=f(2^{2}-1)$. Now let $k \geq 3$. For every even number $2t$ with $2^{k-1}+1<2t \leq 2^{k}$, $f(2t)=2f(t) \leq 2a_{k-1}=2f(2^{k-1}-1)$ by induction hypothesis. For every odd number $2t+1$ with $2^{k-1}+1 \leq 2t+1<2^{k}$, $f(2t+1) =t+2f(t) \leq 2^{k-1}-1+2f(t) \leq 2^{k-1}-1+2a_{k-1}=2^{k-1}-1+2f(2^{k-1}-1)$ again by induction hypothesis. Combining $(\dagger),(\ddagger)$ and $f(2^{k}-1)=f(2(2^{k-1}-1)+1)=2^{k-1}-1+2f(2^{k-1}-1)$ we may conclude that $a_{k}=f(2^{k}-1)$ as desired. Furthermore, we obtain $a_{k}=2a_{k-1}+2^{k-1}-1$ for all $k \geq 3$. Note that this recursive formula for $a_{k}$ also holds for $k \geq 0,1$ and 2 . Unwinding this recursive formula, we finally get $a_{k}=2a_{k-1}+2^{k-1}-1=2(2a_{k-2}+2^{k-2}-1)+2^{k-1}-1 =2^{2}a_{k-2}+2 \cdot 2^{k-1}-2-1=2^{2}(2a_{k-3}+2^{k-3}-1)+2 \cdot 2^{k-1}-2-1 =2^{3}a_{k-3}+3 \cdot 2^{k-1}-2^{2}-2-1 \vdots =2^{k}a_{0}+k2^{k-1}-2^{k-1}-2^{k-2}-\ldots-2-1 =k2^{k-1}-2^{k}+1 \text { for all } k \geq 0.
