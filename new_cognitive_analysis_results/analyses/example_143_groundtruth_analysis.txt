Problem:
Consider a hexagon with vertices labeled  $M$ ,  $M$ ,  $A$ ,  $T$ ,  $H$ ,  $S$  in that order. Clayton starts at the  $M$  adjacent to  $M$  and  $A$ , and writes the letter down. Each second, Clayton moves to an adjacent vertex, each with probability  $\frac{1}{2}$ , and writes down the corresponding letter. Clayton stops moving when the string he's written down contains the letters  $M, A, T$ , and  $H$  in that order, not necessarily consecutively (for example, one valid string might be  $MAMMSHTH$ .) What is the expected length of the string Clayton wrote?

*Proposed by Andrew Milas and Andrew Wu*

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Define the states and transitions:**
   - Let \( S_0 \) be the state where Clayton has not yet written any of the letters \( M, A, T, H \).
   - Let \( S_1 \) be the state where Clayton has written \( M \).
   - Let \( S_2 \) be the state where Clayton has written \( M \) and \( A \).
   - Let \( S_3 \) be the state where Clayton has written \( M, A \) and \( T \).
   - Let \( S_4 \) be the state where Clayton has written \( M, A, T \) and \( H \) (the final state).

2. **Set up the equations for expected lengths:**
   - Let \( E_i \) be the expected number of steps to reach \( S_4 \) from \( S_i \).
   - We need to find \( E_0 \), the expected number of steps to reach \( S_4 \) from the initial state \( S_0 \).

3. **Determine the transitions and expected values:**
   - From \( S_0 \), Clayton can move to \( S_1 \) with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \) or stay in \( S_0 \) with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \).
   - From \( S_1 \), Clayton can move to \( S_2 \) with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \) or stay in \( S_1 \) with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \).
   - From \( S_2 \), Clayton can move to \( S_3 \) with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \) or stay in \( S_2 \) with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \).
   - From \( S_3 \), Clayton can move to \( S_4 \) with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \) or stay in \( S_3 \) with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \).

4. **Set up the system of equations:**
   - \( E_0 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}E_1 + \frac{1}{2}E_0 \)
   - \( E_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}E_2 + \frac{1}{2}E_1 \)
   - \( E_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}E_3 + \frac{1}{2}E_2 \)
   - \( E_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}E_4 + \frac{1}{2}E_3 \)
   - \( E_4 = 0 \) (since \( S_4 \) is the final state)

5. **Solve the system of equations:**
   - From \( E_4 = 0 \), we have:
     \[
     E_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{2}E_3 \implies E_3 = 2
     \]
   - Substitute \( E_3 = 2 \) into the equation for \( E_2 \):
     \[
     E_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(2) + \frac{1}{2}E_2 \implies E_2 = 3
     \]
   - Substitute \( E_2 = 3 \) into the equation for \( E_1 \):
     \[
     E_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(3) + \frac{1}{2}E_1 \implies E_1 = 4
     \]
   - Substitute \( E_1 = 4 \) into the equation for \( E_0 \):
     \[
     E_0 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(4) + \frac{1}{2}E_0 \implies E_0 = 5
     \]

6. **Calculate the total expected length:**
   - The total expected length of the string is \( E_0 + 1 \) (since the initial \( M \) is written immediately).
   - Therefore, the expected length is \( 5 + 1 = 6 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{6}\).

<explanation>The solver transforms the problem about a random walk on a hexagon into a state-based representation. Rather than tracking physical positions, they abstract the problem to track progress toward the goal sequence "MATH". This representation simplifies the problem by focusing on the relevant information (which letters have been collected) rather than the exact position or full string.</explanation>

   - \( E_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}E_4 + \frac{1}{2}E_3 \)
   - \( E_4 = 0 \) (since \( S_4 \) is the final state)</text>
<explanation>The solver formulates recursive equations where each expected value is defined in terms of other expected values. This demonstrates recursive thinking by breaking down the problem into relationships between states, where the expected length from one state depends on the expected lengths from other states.</explanation>

     \[
     E_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{2}E_3 \implies E_3 = 2
     \]
   - Substitute \( E_3 = 2 \) into the equation for \( E_2 \):
     \[
     E_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(2) + \frac{1}{2}E_2 \implies E_2 = 3
     \]
   - Substitute \( E_2 = 3 \) into the equation for \( E_1 \):
     \[
     E_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(3) + \frac{1}{2}E_1 \implies E_1 = 4

     \[
     E_0 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(4) + \frac{1}{2}E_0 \implies E_0 = 5
     \]</text>
<explanation>The solver uses backward induction to solve the system of equations, starting from the final state (E₄ = 0) and working backward to find each previous expected value. This demonstrates understanding that the simplest subproblem is at the end (the final state), and earlier states can be solved once later states are known.</explanation>

     E_0 = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(4) + \frac{1}{2}E_0 \implies E_0 = 5
     \]</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates algebraic manipulation by rearranging equations to solve for unknown variables. For each equation, they isolate the variable of interest (E₃, E₂, E₁, E₀) by moving terms and solving the resulting equation. The pattern E_i = 1 + E_i/2 + E_{i+1}/2 is consistently solved to find E_i = 2 + E_{i+1}.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver breaks down the complex problem of finding the expected length of a random string into subproblems based on progress toward the goal. By defining states S₀ through S₄ and the expected lengths E₀ through E₄, they transform a single complex problem into multiple simpler problems that can be solved sequentially.</explanation>

   - The total expected length of the string is \( E_0 + 1 \) (since the initial \( M \) is written immediately).
   - Therefore, the expected length is \( 5 + 1 = 6 \).</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates understanding of expected value calculation by recognizing that the final answer requires adding 1 to E₀ to account for the initial M that is written immediately. This shows understanding of how to combine different components to calculate the total expected value.</explanation>
