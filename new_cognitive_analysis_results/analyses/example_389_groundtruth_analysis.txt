<explanation>The solver must have applied their knowledge of the divisor function τ(n) to solve this problem. This requires understanding that τ(n) counts the number of divisors of n, and being able to calculate this function for various values. The correct answer suggests they systematically applied this knowledge to find solutions to the equation τ(n) + τ(n+1) = 7.</explanation>

<explanation>To arrive at the correct answer of 540, the solver must have systematically checked values of n to find those where τ(n) + τ(n+1) = 7. This would involve calculating τ(n) for consecutive integers and identifying the six smallest values of n that satisfy the equation. The precise answer indicates a thorough and systematic approach rather than guesswork.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver demonstrated strong number theory reasoning by working with the divisor function τ(n). This likely involved factoring numbers into primes to determine the number of divisors, understanding how τ(n) behaves for different types of numbers, and recognizing patterns in consecutive integers that would lead to τ(n) + τ(n+1) = 7.</explanation>

<explanation>The correct answer of 540 indicates that the solver accurately computed the values of τ(n) for multiple integers, correctly identified the six values of n that satisfy the equation, and correctly summed these values. This demonstrates computational precision throughout a potentially lengthy calculation process.</explanation>

<explanation>To efficiently solve this problem, the solver likely recognized patterns in how τ(n) behaves for different classes of numbers (e.g., primes, powers of primes, highly composite numbers). This pattern recognition would help narrow down the search for values of n where τ(n) + τ(n+1) = 7, making the solution process more efficient.</explanation>
