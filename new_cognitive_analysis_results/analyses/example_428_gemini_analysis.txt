Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the value of the expression $2x^3+(xy)^3+2y^3 = 2(x^3+y^3) + (xy)^3$, given two equations involving $x$ and $y$. The given equations are:
Equation 1: $x^4y^5+y^4x^5=810$
Equation 2: $x^3y^6+y^3x^6=945$

Let's simplify the given equations.

Equation 1: $x^4y^5+y^4x^5 = (xy)^4 y + (xy)^4 x = (xy)^4 (x+y) = 810$

Equation 2: $x^3y^6+y^3x^6 = (xy)^3 y^3 + (xy)^3 x^3 = (xy)^3 (x^3+y^3) = 945$

We need to evaluate $2(x^3+y^3) + (xy)^3$.

Let $a = xy$ and $b = x+y$. The equations become:
Equation 1': $a^4 b = 810$
Equation 2': $a^3 (x^3+y^3) = 945$

We know that $x^3+y^3 = (x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2) = (x+y)((x+y)^2 - 3xy) = b(b^2-3a)$.
Substituting this into Equation 2', we get:
$a^3 b(b^2-3a) = 945$

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables $a$ and $b$:
1. $a^4 b = 810$
2. $a^3 b(b^2-3a) = 945$

From equation 1, if $a \neq 0$, then $b = \frac{810}{a^4}$. Substitute this into equation 2:
$a^3 \left(\frac{810}{a^4}\right) \left(\left(\frac{810}{a^4}\right)^2 - 3a\right) = 945$

$\frac{810}{a} \left(\frac{810^2}{a^8} - 3a\right) = 945$

$\frac{810^3}{a^9} - 810 \cdot 3 = 945$

$\frac{810^3}{a^9} - 2430 = 945$

$\frac{810^3}{a^9} = 945 + 2430 = 3375$

$a^9 = \frac{810^3}{3375}$

Let's find the prime factorization of 810 and 3375.
$810 = 81 \times 10 = 3^4 \times 2 \times 5 = 2 \times 3^4 \times 5$
$3375 = 5 \times 675 = 5 \times 25 \times 27 = 5 \times 5^2 \times 3^3 = 3^3 \times 5^3 = (3 \times 5)^3 = 15^3$

$a^9 = \frac{(2 \times 3^4 \times 5)^3}{3^3 \times 5^3} = \frac{2^3 \times (3^4)^3 \times 5^3}{3^3 \times 5^3} = \frac{8 \times 3^{12} \times 5^3}{3^3 \times 5^3} = 8 \times 3^{12-3} = 8 \times 3^9 = 2^3 \times 3^9$

$a^9 = 2^3 \times 3^9$
This implies $a = (2^3 \times 3^9)^{1/9} = 2^{3/9} \times 3^{9/9} = 2^{1/3} \times 3 = 3 \sqrt[3]{2}$

Now we have the value of $a = xy$. We can find $b = x+y$.
$b = \frac{810}{a^4} = \frac{810}{(3 \sqrt[3]{2})^4} = \frac{810}{3^4 (\sqrt[3]{2})^4} = \frac{810}{81 \cdot 2^{4/3}} = \frac{10}{2 \cdot 2^{1/3}} = \frac{5}{2^{1/3}} = 5 \sqrt[3]{1/2} = 5 \frac{\sqrt[3]{4}}{2}$

This seems complicated. Let's check if there are simpler ways.

Consider the ratio of the two original equations:
$\frac{(xy)^3 (x^3+y^3)}{(xy)^4 (x+y)} = \frac{945}{810}$

$\frac{x^3+y^3}{xy(x+y)} = \frac{945}{810}$

Simplify the fraction $\frac{945}{810}$.
Divide by 5: $\frac{189}{162}$
Divide by 9: $\frac{21}{18}$
Divide by 3: $\frac{7}{6}$

So, $\frac{x^3+y^3}{xy(x+y)} = \frac{7}{6}$

We know $x^3+y^3 = (x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)$.
$\frac{(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)}{xy(x+y)} = \frac{7}{6}$

If $x+y \neq 0$, we can cancel $(x+y)$:
$\frac{x^2-xy+y^2}{xy} = \frac{7}{6}$

$\frac{x^2+y^2-xy}{xy} = \frac{x^2+y^2}{xy} - 1 = \frac{7}{6}$

$\frac{x^2+y^2}{xy} = \frac{7}{6} + 1 = \frac{13}{6}$

$\frac{(x+y)^2 - 2xy}{xy} = \frac{13}{6}$

$\frac{(x+y)^2}{xy} - 2 = \frac{13}{6}$

$\frac{(x+y)^2}{xy} = \frac{13}{6} + 2 = \frac{13+12}{6} = \frac{25}{6}$

$\left(\frac{x+y}{\sqrt{xy}}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{6}$

$\frac{x+y}{\sqrt{xy}} = \pm \frac{5}{\sqrt{6}}$

Let $a = xy$ and $b = x+y$. Then $\frac{b^2}{a} = \frac{25}{6}$.
$6b^2 = 25a$.

From the first equation, $a^4 b = 810$.
We have a system of equations for $a$ and $b$:
1. $6b^2 = 25a$
2. $a^4 b = 810$

From equation 1, $a = \frac{6b^2}{25}$. Substitute into equation 2:
$\left(\frac{6b^2}{25}\right)^4 b = 810$

$\frac{6^4 b^8}{25^4} \cdot b = 810$

$\frac{6^4 b^9}{25^4} = 810$

$b^9 = 810 \cdot \frac{25^4}{6^4} = 810 \cdot \left(\frac{25}{6}\right)^4$

$810 = 2 \times 3^4 \times 5$
$25 = 5^2$
$6 = 2 \times 3$

$b^9 = (2 \times 3^4 \times 5) \cdot \left(\frac{5^2}{2 \times 3}\right)^4 = (2 \times 3^4 \times 5) \cdot \frac{(5^2)^4}{(2 \times 3)^4} = (2 \times 3^4 \times 5) \cdot \frac{5^8}{2^4 \times 3^4}$

$b^9 = \frac{2 \times 3^4 \times 5 \times 5^8}{2^4 \times 3^4} = \frac{2 \times 3^4 \times 5^9}{2^4 \times 3^4} = \frac{5^9}{2^3}$

$b^9 = \frac{5^9}{8}$

$b = \frac{5}{\sqrt[9]{8}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt[9]{2^3}} = \frac{5}{2^{3/9}} = \frac{5}{2^{1/3}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt[3]{2}}$

Now find $a$:
$a = \frac{6b^2}{25} = \frac{6}{25} \left(\frac{5}{\sqrt[3]{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{6}{25} \frac{25}{(\sqrt[3]{2})^2} = \frac{6}{2^{2/3}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{4}}$

We need to evaluate $2(x^3+y^3) + (xy)^3 = 2(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2) + (xy)^3$.
We know $a = xy$ and $b = x+y$.
$x^2-xy+y^2 = (x+y)^2 - 3xy = b^2 - 3a$.

The expression becomes $2 b (b^2 - 3a) + a^3$.

Substitute the values of $a$ and $b$:
$b = \frac{5}{\sqrt[3]{2}}$
$a = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{4}}$

$b^2 = \left(\frac{5}{\sqrt[3]{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{(\sqrt[3]{2})^2} = \frac{25}{\sqrt[3]{4}}$

$3a = 3 \cdot \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{4}} = \frac{18}{\sqrt[3]{4}}$

$b^2 - 3a = \frac{25}{\sqrt[3]{4}} - \frac{18}{\sqrt[3]{4}} = \frac{7}{\sqrt[3]{4}}$

$2 b (b^2 - 3a) = 2 \cdot \frac{5}{\sqrt[3]{2}} \cdot \frac{7}{\sqrt[3]{4}} = \frac{70}{\sqrt[3]{8}} = \frac{70}{2} = 35$

$a^3 = \left(\frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{4}}\right)^3 = \frac{6^3}{(\sqrt[3]{4})^3} = \frac{216}{4} = 54$

The value of the expression is $2 b (b^2 - 3a) + a^3 = 35 + 54 = 89$.

Let's double check the calculations.

Check the values of $a$ and $b$ satisfy the original equations for $a$ and $b$.
Equation 1': $a^4 b = 810$
$a^4 = \left(\frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{4}}\right)^4 = \frac{6^4}{(\sqrt[3]{4})^4} = \frac{1296}{4^{4/3}} = \frac{1296}{(2^2)^{4/3}} = \frac{1296}{2^{8/3}}$

$a^4 b = \frac{1296}{2^{8/3}} \cdot \frac{5}{2^{1/3}} = \frac{1296 \cdot 5}{2^{9/3}} = \frac{6480}{2^3} = \frac{6480}{8} = 810$. (Correct)

Equation 2': $a^3 (x^3+y^3) = 945$
$x^3+y^3 = (x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2) = b(b^2-3a)$
$a^3 b(b^2-3a) = a^3 \cdot b \cdot \frac{7}{\sqrt[3]{4}}$

$a^3 = \left(\frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{4}}\right)^3 = 54$
$b = \frac{5}{\sqrt[3]{2}}$
$\frac{7}{\sqrt[3]{4}}$

$a^3 b(b^2-3a) = 54 \cdot \frac{5}{\sqrt[3]{2}} \cdot \frac{7}{\sqrt[3]{4}} = 54 \cdot \frac{35}{\sqrt[3]{8}} = 54 \cdot \frac{35}{2} = 27 \cdot 35$

$27 \times 35 = 27 \times (30 + 5) = 810 + 135 = 945$. (Correct)

The value of the expression $2x^3+(xy)^3+2y^3 = 2(x^3+y^3) + (xy)^3 = 2 b(b^2-3a) + a^3 = 35 + 54 = 89$.

Consider the case where $x=0$ or $y=0$.
If $x=0$, then $0 = 810$, contradiction.
If $y=0$, then $0 = 810$, contradiction.
So $x \neq 0$ and $y \neq 0$.

Consider the case where $x+y = 0$, so $y = -x$.
Equation 1: $x^4(-x)^5 + (-x)^4 x^5 = -x^9 + x^9 = 0 \neq 810$, contradiction.
So $x+y \neq 0$.

Consider the case where $xy = 0$. This leads to contradiction as seen above.

The solution seems consistent.

Alternative approach:
Let $P = xy$.
Eq 1: $P^4 (x+y) = 810$
Eq 2: $P^3 (x^3+y^3) = 945$

Ratio: $\frac{x^3+y^3}{P(x+y)} = \frac{945}{810} = \frac{7}{6}$
$\frac{(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)}{xy(x+y)} = \frac{7}{6}$
$\frac{x^2-xy+y^2}{xy} = \frac{7}{6}$
$\frac{x^2+y^2}{xy} - 1 = \frac{7}{6}$
$\frac{x^2+y^2}{xy} = \frac{13}{6}$
$\frac{(x+y)^2 - 2xy}{xy} = \frac{13}{6}$
$\frac{(x+y)^2}{xy} - 2 = \frac{13}{6}$
$\frac{(x+y)^2}{xy} = \frac{25}{6}$

Let $S = x+y$. $\frac{S^2}{P} = \frac{25}{6}$, so $6S^2 = 25P$.

From Eq 1: $P^4 S = 810$.

Substitute $P = \frac{6S^2}{25}$:
$\left(\frac{6S^2}{25}\right)^4 S = 810$
$\frac{6^4 S^8}{25^4} \cdot S = 810$
$\frac{6^4 S^9}{25^4} = 810$
$S^9 = 810 \cdot \frac{25^4}{6^4} = 810 \cdot \left(\frac{25}{6}\right)^4$
This is the same expression we obtained for $b^9$.

The expression to evaluate is $2(x^3+y^3) + (xy)^3 = 2 S(S^2-3P) + P^3$.
We have $P = \frac{6S^2}{25}$.

Substitute $P$ in terms of $S$:
$2 S \left(S^2 - 3 \frac{6S^2}{25}\right) + \left(\frac{6S^2}{25}\right)^3$
$= 2 S \left(S^2 - \frac{18S^2}{25}\right) + \frac{6^3 S^6}{25^3}$
$= 2 S \left(\frac{25S^2 - 18S^2}{25}\right) + \frac{216 S^6}{15625}$
$= 2 S \left(\frac{7S^2}{25}\right) + \frac{216 S^6}{15625}$
$= \frac{14 S^3}{25} + \frac{216 S^6}{15625}$

We need the value of $S$.
$S^9 = 810 \cdot \left(\frac{25}{6}\right)^4 = \frac{5^9}{8}$
$S = \frac{5}{\sqrt[9]{8}} = \frac{5}{2^{1/3}}$

$S^3 = \left(\frac{5}{2^{1/3}}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{2}$
$S^6 = (S^3)^2 = \left(\frac{125}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{15625}{4}$

Expression value:
$\frac{14}{25} \cdot \frac{125}{2} + \frac{216}{15625} \cdot \frac{15625}{4}$
$= \frac{14 \cdot 5}{2} + \frac{216}{4}$
$= 7 \cdot 5 + 54 = 35 + 54 = 89$.

The result is consistent.

4. Verification and Error Checking - The solver consistently verifies solutions against original constraints and checks special cases to ensure mathematical correctness.

5. Alternative Solution Pathways - The solver demonstrates flexibility by pursuing multiple approaches to the same problem, recognizing when one path becomes inefficient and pivoting to more elegant methods.
