Problem:
In hyperdrive, Spaceship-0 is relativistically moving at the velocity $\frac{1}{3} c$ with respect to reference frame $R_{1}$, as measured by Spaceship-1. Spaceship-1 is moving at $\frac{1}{2} c$ with respect to reference frame $R_{2}$, as measured by Spaceship-2. Spaceship- $k$ is moving at speed $v_{k}=\frac{k+1}{k+3} c$ with respect to reference frame $R_{k+1}$. The speed of Spaceship-0 with respect to reference frame $R_{20}$ can be expressed as a decimal fraction of the speed of light which has only $x$ number of 9 s following the decimal point (i.e., in the form of $0 . \underbrace{99 \ldots 9}_{x \text { times }} c)$. Find the value of $x$.

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Let us define the rapidity as
$$
\tanh \phi \equiv \beta=\frac{v}{c}
$$

where tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function. Let $\beta_{1}=\tanh \phi_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}=\tanh \phi_{2}$. If we add $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ using the relativistic velocity addition formula, we find that

$$
\beta=\frac{\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}}{1-\beta_{1} \beta_{2}}=\frac{\tanh \phi_{1}+\tanh \phi_{2}}{1+\tanh \phi_{1} \tanh \phi_{2}}=\tanh \left(\phi_{1}+\phi_{2}\right)
$$

We can then rewrite the problem as

$$
v_{f}=\tanh \left(\operatorname{arctanh} \frac{1}{3}+\operatorname{arctanh} \frac{2}{4}+\cdots+\operatorname{arctanh} \frac{20}{22}\right)
$$



Using the fact that $\operatorname{arctanh}(\phi)=\frac{1}{2} \ln \left(\frac{1+\phi}{1-\phi}\right)$, we can find that

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{f} & =\tanh \left(\frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=0}^{19} \ln \left(\frac{1+\frac{k+1}{k+3}}{1-\frac{k+1}{k+3}}\right)\right)=\tanh \left(\frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=0}^{19} \ln (k+2)\right) \\
& =\tanh (\ln \sqrt{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdots 21})=\tanh (\ln \sqrt{21 !})
\end{aligned}
$$

As $\tanh \phi=\left(e^{\phi}-e^{-\phi}\right) /\left(e^{\phi}+e^{-\phi}\right)$, then

$$
\tanh (\ln (\phi))=\frac{\phi-\frac{1}{\phi}}{\phi+\frac{1}{\phi}}=1-\frac{2}{\phi^{2}+1} \Longrightarrow v_{f}=1-\frac{2}{21 !+1}
$$

This implies 19 zeros, but you can also use Stirlings approximation to further approximate the factorial.

Alternate 1: Define $u_{k}$ as Spaceship 0's velocity in frame $R_{k}$, given $c=1$. The recurrence relation from the relativistic velocity addition formula is: $u_{k+1}=\frac{u_{k}(k+3)+(k+1)}{u_{k}(k+1)+(k+3)}$, starting with $u_{1}=\frac{1}{3}$. The relation can be simplified as: $u_{k+1}=1+\frac{2\left(u_{k}-1\right)}{u_{k}(k+1)+(k+3)}$. Introducing $v_{k}=u_{k}-1$, $v_{k+1}=v_{k} \frac{2}{v_{k}(k+1)+(2 k+4)}$. Further simplifying with $w_{k}=\frac{1}{v_{k}}$, we get $w_{k+1}=w_{k}(k+2)+\frac{k+1}{2}$. By setting $x_{k}=w_{k}+c$, we find $c=-\frac{1}{2}$ simplifies to $x_{k+1}=x_{k}(k+2)$. This gives $x_{k}=$ $(k+1)(k)(k-1) \ldots(4)(3) x_{1}$ and using the initial condition $x_{1}=\frac{1}{u_{1}-1}+\frac{1}{2}=1$, we obtain $x_{k}=\frac{(k+1) !}{2}$. Consequently, $u_{k}=\frac{(k+1) !-1}{(k+1) !+1}$ and substituting $k=20, u_{20} \approx 1-3.9 \times 10^{-20}$, yielding 19 significant digits.

Alternate 2: Let $l=k+2$, then $u_{l}=\frac{l-1}{l+1}$. Let $u_{m}=\frac{m-1}{m+1}$. Then you can find that the velocity addition of any $l, m$ will be $\frac{m l-1}{m l+1}$. Using this identity, we can use recurrence to find that $u_{k}=\frac{(k+1) !-1}{(k+1) !+1}$.
