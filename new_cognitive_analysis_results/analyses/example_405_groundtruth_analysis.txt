Problem:
For a permutation $p = (a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_9)$ of the digits $1,2,\ldots,9$ , let $s(p)$ denote the sum of the three $3$ -digit numbers $a_1a_2a_3$ , $a_4a_5a_6$ , and $a_7a_8a_9$ . Let $m$ be the minimum value of $s(p)$ subject to the condition that the units digit of $s(p)$ is $0$ . Let $n$ denote the number of permutations $p$ with $s(p) = m$ . Find $|m - n|$ .

<definition>Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts to address each component separately.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>162</text>
<explanation>The solver has decomposed the problem into finding two separate values (m and n) and then calculating their absolute difference. Although the solution only shows the final answer (162), this implies the solver broke down the original problem into finding the minimum sum m and counting the number of permutations n that yield this sum.</explanation>

<definition>The ability to understand numbers, their relationships, and to make reasonable judgments about numerical values.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>162</text>
<explanation>The solver has determined a specific numerical value (162) as the answer, which suggests they had to work with the constraints of the problem to determine numerical values for m and n. This requires understanding the properties of 3-digit numbers formed from permutations and how their sums behave.</explanation>

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify recurring patterns, structures, or relationships within mathematical objects or sequences.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>162</text>
<explanation>To find the minimum value of s(p) with a units digit of 0, the solver likely recognized patterns in how the units digit of the sum relates to the units digits of the three 3-digit numbers, and how to minimize the overall sum while maintaining this constraint.</explanation>

<skill>Constraint Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify, understand, and work within the constraints of a problem to find valid solutions.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>162</text>
<explanation>The problem has specific constraints: using each digit 1-9 exactly once, forming three 3-digit numbers, and ensuring their sum has 0 as the units digit. The solver had to analyze these constraints to determine which permutations would yield the minimum sum with the required units digit.</explanation>

<skill>Combinatorial Thinking</skill>
<definition>The ability to count, enumerate, or analyze different arrangements, selections, or configurations of objects.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>162</text>
<explanation>The problem involves permutations of digits, and the solver needed to determine how many different permutations would yield the minimum sum. This requires understanding and working with combinatorial principles to count valid arrangements.</explanation>

<skill>Systematic Approach</skill>
<definition>Following a methodical, organized process to solve a problem rather than using trial and error.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>162</text>
<explanation>Although we only see the final answer, arriving at the exact value 162 suggests the solver employed a systematic approach to find the minimum sum m that ends in 0, and then counted the exact number of permutations n that produce this sum.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Optimization</skill>
<definition>The ability to make choices that optimize toward a specific goal, such as minimizing or maximizing a value.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>162</text>
<explanation>The problem explicitly asks for the minimum value of s(p) subject to a constraint. The solver had to strategically determine which digits to place in which positions to minimize the sum while ensuring the units digit is 0.</explanation>
