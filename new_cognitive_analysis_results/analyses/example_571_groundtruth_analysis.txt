Problem:
Suppose that  $X$  and  $Y$  are two metric spaces and  $f:X \longrightarrow Y$  is a continious function. Also for every compact set  $K \subseteq Y$ , it's pre-image  $f^{pre}(K)$  is a compact set in  $X$ . Prove that  $f$  is a closed function, i.e for every close set  $C\subseteq X$ , it's image  $f(C)$  is a closed subset of  $Y$ .

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Assume for contradiction**: Suppose that $C \subseteq X$ is a closed set, but $f(C)$ is not a closed subset of $Y$. This means there exists a point $y \in Y$ such that $y \notin f(C)$, but there is a sequence $\{f(c_i)\}$ with $c_i \in C$ for all $i$, and $f(c_i) \to y$ as $i \to \infty$.

2. **Construct the set $K$**: Consider the set $K = \{y, f(c_1), f(c_2), \ldots\}$. We claim that $K$ is compact. To show this, we need to demonstrate that every sequence in $K$ has a convergent subsequence whose limit is in $K$.

3. **Compactness of $K$**: Given any infinite sequence in $K$, either it has infinitely many distinct elements or finitely many. If it has finitely many distinct elements, we can choose a constant subsequence. Otherwise, we can choose a sequence of distinct elements of the form $\{f(c_{n_k})\}$, which converges to $y \in K$ by construction. Hence, $K$ is compact.

4. **Pre-image of $K$**: By the given assumption, the pre-image $K' = f^{-1}(K)$ is compact in $X$. Since $c_i \in K'$ and the $c_i$ are distinct, the sequence $\{c_i\}$ has a convergent subsequence $\{c_{n_k}\}$ such that $c_{n_k} \to c \in K'$.

5. **Continuity and contradiction**: By the continuity of $f$, we have $f(c_{n_k}) \to f(c)$. Since $f(c_{n_k}) \to y$, it follows that $f(c) = y$. However, $y \notin f(C)$ by assumption, which implies $c \notin C$. This contradicts the fact that $c_{n_k} \in C$ and $C$ is closed, as a closed set contains all its limit points.

6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our initial assumption that $f(C)$ is not closed must be false. Hence, $f(C)$ is closed for every closed set $C \subseteq X$.

<text>1. **Assume for contradiction**: Suppose that $C \subseteq X$ is a closed set, but $f(C)$ is not a closed subset of $Y$. This means there exists a point $y \in Y$ such that $y \notin f(C)$, but there is a sequence $\{f(c_i)\}$ with $c_i \in C$ for all $i$, and $f(c_i) \to y$ as $i \to \infty$.

If it has finitely many distinct elements, we can choose a constant subsequence. Otherwise, we can choose a sequence of distinct elements of the form $\{f(c_{n_k})\}$, which converges to $y \in K$ by construction. Hence, $K$ is compact.

4. **Pre-image of $K$**: By the given assumption, the pre-image $K' = f^{-1}(K)$ is compact in $X$. Since $c_i \in K'$ and the $c_i$ are distinct, the sequence $\{c_i\}$ has a convergent subsequence $\{c_{n_k}\}$ such that $c_{n_k} \to c \in K'$.

5. **Continuity and contradiction**: By the continuity of $f$, we have $f(c_{n_k}) \to f(c)$. Since $f(c_{n_k}) \to y$, it follows that $f(c) = y$. However, $y \notin f(C)$ by assumption, which implies $c \notin C$. This contradicts the fact that $c_{n_k} \in C$ and $C$ is closed, as a closed set contains all its limit points.</text>
<explanation>The entire solution demonstrates strategic problem decomposition, as the solver breaks down the proof into clear logical steps: assuming the contradiction, constructing a specific set, proving its compactness, analyzing its pre-image, and finally reaching the contradiction. Each step builds on the previous one in a systematic way.</explanation>
