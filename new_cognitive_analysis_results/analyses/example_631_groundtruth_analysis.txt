\[f(x)=\frac{a}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \sin (x+y)f(y)dy+\frac{b}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \cos (x-y)f(y)dy+\sin x+\cos x\]

Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
To solve the given problem, we need to find the conditions on \(a\) and \(b\) such that the function \(f(x)\) is uniquely determined, and then determine \(f(x)\). The function \(f(x)\) is given by:

\[
f(x) = \frac{a}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x+y) f(y) \, dy + \frac{b}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \cos(x-y) f(y) \, dy + \sin x + \cos x
\]

1. **Simplify the integrals:**
   We start by simplifying the integrals. Note that:
   \[
   \sin(x+y) = \sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y
   \]
   \[
   \cos(x-y) = \cos x \cos y + \sin x \sin y
   \]

   Substituting these into the integrals, we get:
   \[
   \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x+y) f(y) \, dy = \int_0^{2\pi} (\sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y) f(y) \, dy
   \]
   \[
   = \sin x \int_0^{2\pi} \cos y f(y) \, dy + \cos x \int_0^{2\pi} \sin y f(y) \, dy
   \]

   Similarly,
   \[
   \int_0^{2\pi} \cos(x-y) f(y) \, dy = \int_0^{2\pi} (\cos x \cos y + \sin x \sin y) f(y) \, dy
   \]
   \[
   = \cos x \int_0^{2\pi} \cos y f(y) \, dy + \sin x \int_0^{2\pi} \sin y f(y) \, dy
   \]

2. **Introduce constants:**
   Let:
   \[
   \alpha = \int_0^{2\pi} \cos y f(y) \, dy
   \]
   \[
   \beta = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin y f(y) \, dy
   \]

   Then the equation for \(f(x)\) becomes:
   \[
   f(x) = \frac{a}{2\pi} (\sin x \alpha + \cos x \beta) + \frac{b}{2\pi} (\cos x \alpha + \sin x \beta) + \sin x + \cos x
   \]
   \[
   = \left( \frac{a \alpha + b \beta}{2\pi} \right) \sin x + \left( \frac{a \beta + b \alpha}{2\pi} \right) \cos x + \sin x + \cos x
   \]

3. **Equate coefficients:**
   For \(f(x)\) to be uniquely determined, the coefficients of \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\) must match on both sides of the equation. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \frac{a \alpha + b \beta}{2\pi} + 1 = 1
   \]
   \[
   \frac{a \beta + b \alpha}{2\pi} + 1 = 1
   \]

   Simplifying these, we get:
   \[
   \frac{a \alpha + b \beta}{2\pi} = 0
   \]
   \[
   \frac{a \beta + b \alpha}{2\pi} = 0
   \]

4. **Solve the system:**
   This system of equations can be written as:
   \[
   a \alpha + b \beta = 0
   \]
   \[
   a \beta + b \alpha = 0
   \]

   For a non-trivial solution \((\alpha, \beta) \neq (0, 0)\), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:
   \[
   \begin{vmatrix}
   a & b \\
   b & a
   \end{vmatrix} = a^2 - b^2 = 0
   \]
   \[
   a^2 = b^2
   \]
   \[
   a = \pm b
   \]

5. **Determine \(f(x)\):**
   If \(a = b\), then the system becomes:
   \[
   a (\alpha + \beta) = 0
   \]
   \[
   a (\beta + \alpha) = 0
   \]

   Since \(a \neq 0\), we have \(\alpha + \beta = 0\). Therefore, \(\alpha = -\beta\).

   Substituting \(\alpha = -\beta\) into the original equation, we get:
   \[
   f(x) = \left( \frac{a \alpha + b \beta}{2\pi} \right) \sin x + \left( \frac{a \beta + b \alpha}{2\pi} \right) \cos x + \sin x + \cos x
   \]
   \[
   = \left( \frac{a (-\beta) + b \beta}{2\pi} \right) \sin x + \left( \frac{a \beta + b (-\beta)}{2\pi} \right) \cos x + \sin x + \cos x
   \]
   \[
   = \left( \frac{-a \beta + b \beta}{2\pi} \right) \sin x + \left( \frac{a \beta - b \beta}{2\pi} \right) \cos x + \sin x + \cos x
   \]
   \[
   = \left( \frac{\beta (b - a)}{2\pi} \right) \sin x + \left( \frac{\beta (a - b)}{2\pi} \right) \cos x + \sin x + \cos x
   \]

   Since \(a = b\), the coefficients of \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\) become zero:
   \[
   f(x) = \sin x + \cos x
   \]

   Therefore, the function \(f(x)\) is uniquely determined as:
   \[
   f(x) = \sin x + \cos x
   \]

The final answer is \( \boxed{ f(x) = \sin x + \cos x } \)

   \]
   \[
   \beta = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin y f(y) \, dy
   \]

   Then the equation for \(f(x)\) becomes:

   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver abstracts the complex integral expressions into simpler variables (α and β), then reorganizes the equation to group terms by their trigonometric components. This strategic abstraction transforms the functional equation into a more manageable algebraic form that highlights the coefficients of sin x and cos x.</explanation>

<skill>Coefficient Matching</skill>
<definition>The technique of identifying and equating coefficients of like terms in equations to establish necessary conditions for the equations to be valid.</definition>

<start>1059</start>
<end>1279</end>
<text>3. **Equate coefficients:**
   For \(f(x)\) to be uniquely determined, the coefficients of \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\) must match on both sides of the equation. Therefore, we have:
   \[

   \]
   \[
   \frac{a \beta + b \alpha}{2\pi} + 1 = 1
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the coefficient matching technique by recognizing that for the equation to have a unique solution, the coefficients of sin x and cos x must be equal on both sides. This demonstrates understanding that in a functional equation, the basis functions (sin x and cos x) are linearly independent, so their coefficients must match independently.</explanation>

   This system of equations can be written as:
   \[
   a \alpha + b \beta = 0
   \]
   \[
   a \beta + b \alpha = 0
   \]

   For a non-trivial solution \((\alpha, \beta) \neq (0, 0)\), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:
   \[
   \begin{vmatrix}
   a & b \\
   b & a
   \end{vmatrix} = a^2 - b^2 = 0
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver applies linear algebra reasoning by recognizing the system of equations can be analyzed using determinants.

<explanation>The solver makes a logical inference by deducing that if a² = b², then a = ±b. This demonstrates the ability to draw a precise mathematical conclusion from an equation using the properties of square roots.</explanation>

<start>1721</start>
<end>1900</end>
<text>5. **Determine \(f(x)\):**
   If \(a = b\), then the system becomes:
   \[
   a (\alpha + \beta) = 0
   \]
   \[
   a (\beta + \alpha) = 0
   \]

   Since \(a \neq 0\), we have \(\alpha + \beta = 0\). Therefore, \(\alpha = -\beta\).</text>
<explanation>The solver applies logical inference by substituting a = b into the system of equations and deducing that since a ≠ 0 (as that would make the problem trivial), the only possibility is α + β = 0, which implies α = -β. This shows careful step-by-step logical reasoning.</explanation>

<skill>Verification and Validation</skill>
<definition>The process of checking that a solution satisfies all the conditions of the original problem and confirming the correctness of intermediate steps.</definition>

   \]
   \[
   = \left( \frac{a (-\beta) + b \beta}{2\pi} \right) \sin x + \left( \frac{a \beta + b (-\beta)}{2\pi} \right) \cos x + \sin x + \cos x
   \]
   \[
   = \left( \frac{-a \beta + b \beta}{2\pi} \right) \sin x + \left( \frac{a \beta - b \beta}{2\pi} \right) \cos x + \sin x + \cos x
   \]
   \[

<definition>The systematic transformation of mathematical expressions using operations and properties of algebra to simplify or solve equations.</definition>

<start>232</start>
<end>690</end>
<text>Substituting these into the integrals, we get:
   \[
   \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x+y) f(y) \, dy = \int_0^{2\pi} (\sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y) f(y) \, dy
   \]
   \[
   = \sin x \int_0^{2\pi} \cos y f(y) \, dy + \cos x \int_0^{2\pi} \sin y f(y) \, dy
   \]

   Similarly,
   \[
   \int_0^{2\pi} \cos(x-y) f(y) \, dy = \int_0^{2\pi} (\cos x \cos y + \sin x \sin y) f(y) \, dy
   \]
   \[
   = \cos x \int_0^{2\pi} \cos y f(y) \, dy + \sin x \int_0^{2\pi} \sin y f(y) \, dy
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver skillfully manipulates algebraic expressions by substituting the trigonometric identities into the integrals and then factoring out the terms that are independent of the integration variable. This demonstrates proficiency in algebraic manipulation by correctly applying distributive properties and recognizing which terms can be moved outside the integral.</explanation>

<start>848</start>
<end>1058</end>
<text>Then the equation for \(f(x)\) becomes:
   \[
   f(x) = \frac{a}{2\pi} (\sin x \alpha + \cos x \beta) + \frac{b}{2\pi} (\cos x \alpha + \sin x \beta) + \sin x + \cos x
   \]
   \[
   = \left( \frac{a \alpha + b \beta}{2\pi} \right) \sin x + \left( \frac{a \beta + b \alpha}{2\pi} \right) \cos x + \sin x + \cos x
