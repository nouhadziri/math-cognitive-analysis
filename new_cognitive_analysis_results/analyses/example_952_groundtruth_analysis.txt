Problem:
Consider an ultra high energy proton coming from deep space. This proton collide with a photon from the cosmic microwave background. This collision is head-on. During this process two new particles are produced as follows:
p+$\gamma$ ---> n+$\pi^+$,
where p and $\gamma$ are the proton and the photon, and the new particles n and $\pi^+$ are neutron and a positively charged pion, respectively.
Find the energy threshold of the photon in ev which is needed for the production of neutron and pion, when the temperature of the background radiation drops to 1 Kelvin. 

Hint 1: At the threshold for production of the pion and neutron, they are both produced at rest.
Hint 2: Note that proton is utra relativistic in this question (three-momentum of the proton equals to its energy) 
Hint 3: The mass of proton is 938.3 Mev/c^2, and that of a neutron is 939.6 Mev/c^2. Moreover, mass of the $\pi^+$ is 139.6 Mev/c^2.

Answer Choices:
(A) 11.51 * 10**20 ev
(B) 1.37 * 10**20 ev
(C) 2.74 * 10**20 ev
(D) 8.24 * 10^20 ev

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
This question asks for GZK limit of high energy cosmic rays. Solving this question requires a background in relativistic kinematics. The energy E_p can be found using conservation of energy and momentum.
$\frac{(M_n+M_pi)^2 - M_p}{4E_{\gamma}}$,
where $E_\gamma=K_B T$ is the energy of background photons. Note that this energy must be converted in ev unit.
GZK limit today (with CMB temperature=3K) is 2.74 * 10**20. So that is an incorrect answer, as we are looking for GZK limit at temperature T=1 K. Plugging numbers into the formula above, gives:
E_p=8.24 * 10^20
Any proton with energy higher than this limit would scatter off the cosmic microwave background photons and be lost. An example of such calculation is given in the following: https://www.hep.shef.ac.uk/edaw/PHY206/Site/2012_course_files/phy206rlec5.pdf
