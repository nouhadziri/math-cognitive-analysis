Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the maximum possible efficiency of converting vertically polarized light to horizontally polarized light using a series of $N=5$ linear polarizers. Efficiency is the ratio of output intensity to input intensity.

Let the initial vertically polarized light have an intensity $I_0$. The polarization direction can be represented by a vector along the y-axis. The target is horizontally polarized light, with polarization direction along the x-axis. The angle between the initial and final polarization directions is $90^\circ$.

Consider a single linear polarizer with its transmission axis at an angle $\theta$ with respect to the vertical. If light with intensity $I_{in}$ and polarization along the vertical passes through this polarizer, the transmitted light will have intensity $I_{out} = I_{in} \cos^2 \theta$, and its polarization will be along the transmission axis of the polarizer.

We have a series of $N=5$ polarizers. Let the angles of their transmission axes with respect to the vertical be $\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4, \theta_5$. The initial polarization is at $0^\circ$ (vertical), and the final polarization should be at $90^\circ$ (horizontal).

The first polarizer:
Input intensity $I_0$, polarization at $0^\circ$.
Transmission axis at $\theta_1$.
Output intensity $I_1 = I_0 \cos^2(\theta_1 - 0^\circ) = I_0 \cos^2 \theta_1$.
Polarization of the transmitted light is along $\theta_1$.

The second polarizer:
Input intensity $I_1$, polarization at $\theta_1$.
Transmission axis at $\theta_2$.
Output intensity $I_2 = I_1 \cos^2(\theta_2 - \theta_1) = I_0 \cos^2 \theta_1 \cos^2(\theta_2 - \theta_1)$.
Polarization of the transmitted light is along $\theta_2$.

Continuing this pattern, for the $k$-th polarizer:
Input intensity $I_{k-1}$, polarization at $\theta_{k-1}$.
Transmission axis at $\theta_k$.
Output intensity $I_k = I_{k-1} \cos^2(\theta_k - \theta_{k-1})$.

The output intensity after passing through all $N=5$ polarizers is:
$I_{out} = I_0 \cos^2 \theta_1 \cos^2(\theta_2 - \theta_1) \cos^2(\theta_3 - \theta_2) \cos^2(\theta_4 - \theta_3) \cos^2(\theta_5 - \theta_4)$.

The polarization of the light after passing through the last polarizer is along the transmission axis of the last polarizer, $\theta_5$. Since the final light should be horizontally polarized, we must have $\theta_5 = 90^\circ$.

The efficiency of the process is $\frac{I_{out}}{I_0} = \cos^2 \theta_1 \cos^2(\theta_2 - \theta_1) \cos^2(\theta_3 - \theta_2) \cos^2(\theta_4 - \theta_3) \cos^2(90^\circ - \theta_4)$.
Using $\cos(90^\circ - \alpha) = \sin \alpha$, we have $\cos^2(90^\circ - \theta_4) = \sin^2 \theta_4$.

Efficiency $E = \cos^2 \theta_1 \cos^2(\theta_2 - \theta_1) \cos^2(\theta_3 - \theta_2) \cos^2(\theta_4 - \theta_3) \sin^2 \theta_4$.

We need to maximize this expression with respect to the angles $\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4$. The angles must satisfy $0^\circ < \theta_1 < \theta_2 < \theta_3 < \theta_4 < 90^\circ$. The sequence of polarization directions progresses from vertical to horizontal.

Consider the case with one polarizer ($N=1$). To change vertical to horizontal, the transmission axis should be at $45^\circ$. Efficiency = $\cos^2(45^\circ) = (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})^2 = \frac{1}{2}$. However, the output polarization is at $45^\circ$, not horizontal.

Consider the case with two polarizers ($N=2$).
Efficiency $E = \cos^2 \theta_1 \cos^2(90^\circ - \theta_1) = \cos^2 \theta_1 \sin^2 \theta_1 = (\sin \theta_1 \cos \theta_1)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2} \sin 2\theta_1\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \sin^2 2\theta_1$.
The maximum value is $\frac{1}{4}$ when $\sin^2 2\theta_1 = 1$, so $2\theta_1 = 90^\circ$, $\theta_1 = 45^\circ$.
The transmission axes are at $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2 = 90^\circ$.
Polarizer 1 at $45^\circ$.
Input vertical, after polarizer 1: intensity $\frac{1}{2} I_0$, polarization at $45^\circ$.
Polarizer 2 at $90^\circ$ (horizontal).
Input to polarizer 2 is at $45^\circ$, transmission axis at $90^\circ$. Angle between them is $90^\circ - 45^\circ = 45^\circ$.
Output intensity = $\frac{1}{2} I_0 \cos^2(45^\circ) = \frac{1}{2} I_0 \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} I_0$.
Efficiency = $\frac{1}{4}$.

Now back to $N=5$. Let the angles between consecutive polarizers be constant, $\Delta \theta$.
$\theta_1 = \Delta \theta$
$\theta_2 - \theta_1 = \Delta \theta \implies \theta_2 = 2 \Delta \theta$
$\theta_3 - \theta_2 = \Delta \theta \implies \theta_3 = 3 \Delta \theta$
$\theta_4 - \theta_3 = \Delta \theta \implies \theta_4 = 4 \Delta \theta$
$\theta_5 = 90^\circ$.

If the angles are equally spaced, then the angles of the transmission axes are $1 \times \frac{90}{5}, 2 \times \frac{90}{5}, 3 \times \frac{90}{5}, 4 \times \frac{90}{5}, 5 \times \frac{90}{5} = 18^\circ, 36^\circ, 54^\circ, 72^\circ, 90^\circ$.
$\theta_1 = 18^\circ, \theta_2 = 36^\circ, \theta_3 = 54^\circ, \theta_4 = 72^\circ$.

Efficiency $E = \cos^2(18^\circ) \cos^2(36^\circ - 18^\circ) \cos^2(54^\circ - 36^\circ) \cos^2(72^\circ - 54^\circ) \sin^2(72^\circ)$
$E = \cos^2(18^\circ) \cos^2(18^\circ) \cos^2(18^\circ) \cos^2(18^\circ) \sin^2(72^\circ)$
$E = (\cos^2 18^\circ)^4 \sin^2 72^\circ = (\cos^2 18^\circ)^4 \cos^2(90^\circ - 72^\circ) = (\cos^2 18^\circ)^4 \cos^2 18^\circ = (\cos^2 18^\circ)^5$.

$\cos^2 18^\circ \approx (0.951)^2 \approx 0.904$.
$E \approx (0.904)^5 \approx 0.605$.

Now, let's consider the general case of $N$ polarizers.
The angles of the transmission axes are $0 = \alpha_0, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_N = 90^\circ$.
The angles relative to the previous polarization are $\alpha_1 - \alpha_0, \alpha_2 - \alpha_1, ..., \alpha_N - \alpha_{N-1}$.
Let $\Delta \alpha_i = \alpha_i - \alpha_{i-1}$.
Efficiency $E = \cos^2(\Delta \alpha_1) \cos^2(\Delta \alpha_2) ... \cos^2(\Delta \alpha_N)$.
We have $\sum_{i=1}^N \Delta \alpha_i = \alpha_N - \alpha_0 = 90^\circ$.
$\Delta \alpha_i > 0$.

We need to maximize $\prod_{i=1}^N \cos^2(\Delta \alpha_i)$ subject to $\sum_{i=1}^N \Delta \alpha_i = 90^\circ$.
Equivalently, maximize $\prod_{i=1}^N \cos(\Delta \alpha_i)$.

Consider the function $f(x) = \ln(\cos x)$. We want to maximize $\sum_{i=1}^N \ln(\cos(\Delta \alpha_i))$.
Using Lagrange multipliers:
$L(\Delta \alpha_1, ..., \Delta \alpha_N, \lambda) = \sum_{i=1}^N \ln(\cos(\Delta \alpha_i)) - \lambda (\sum_{i=1}^N \Delta \alpha_i - 90^\circ)$.
$\frac{\partial L}{\partial (\Delta \alpha_i)} = \frac{-\sin(\Delta \alpha_i)}{\cos(\Delta \alpha_i)} - \lambda = -\tan(\Delta \alpha_i) - \lambda = 0$.
$\tan(\Delta \alpha_i) = -\lambda$.

This implies that $\tan(\Delta \alpha_1) = \tan(\Delta \alpha_2) = ... = \tan(\Delta \alpha_N)$.
Since $0 < \Delta \alpha_i < 90^\circ$, we have $\Delta \alpha_1 = \Delta \alpha_2 = ... = \Delta \alpha_N$.
Let $\Delta \alpha_i = \Delta \alpha$.
$\sum_{i=1}^N \Delta \alpha = N \Delta \alpha = 90^\circ$.
$\Delta \alpha = \frac{90^\circ}{N}$.

The optimal angles between consecutive polarizers are equal.
$\Delta \alpha_i = \frac{90^\circ}{N}$.

The angles of the transmission axes are:
$\theta_1 = \frac{90^\circ}{N}$
$\theta_2 = 2 \frac{90^\circ}{N}$
...
$\theta_N = N \frac{90^\circ}{N} = 90^\circ$.

Maximum efficiency $E_{max} = \left( \cos^2 \left(\frac{90^\circ}{N}\right) \right)^N = \cos^{2N} \left(\frac{90^\circ}{N}\right)$.

For $N=5$,
$E_{max} = \cos^{10} \left(\frac{90^\circ}{5}\right) = \cos^{10} (18^\circ)$.

We need to calculate $\cos 18^\circ$.
Let $\theta = 18^\circ$, then $5\theta = 90^\circ$.
$2\theta = 36^\circ$, $3\theta = 54^\circ$.
$2\theta + 3\theta = 90^\circ$.
$\sin(2\theta) = \sin(90^\circ - 3\theta) = \cos(3\theta)$.
$2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta$.
Since $\cos \theta \neq 0$, we can divide by $\cos \theta$:
$2 \sin \theta = 4 \cos^2 \theta - 3 = 4(1 - \sin^2 \theta) - 3 = 4 - 4 \sin^2 \theta - 3 = 1 - 4 \sin^2 \theta$.
$4 \sin^2 \theta + 2 \sin \theta - 1 = 0$.

Let $x = \sin \theta$. $4x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0$.
$x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4(4)(-1)}}{8} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 16}}{8} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{20}}{8} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{4}$.
Since $\sin 18^\circ > 0$, $\sin 18^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4}$.

$\cos^2 18^\circ = 1 - \sin^2 18^\circ = 1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{5 + 1 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16} = 1 - \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16} = 1 - \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{8 - 3 + \sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{8}$.

Maximum efficiency $E_{max} = (\cos^2 18^\circ)^5 = \left(\frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{8}\right)^5$.

Numerical calculation:
$\sqrt{5} \approx 2.236$.
$\frac{5 + 2.236}{8} = \frac{7.236}{8} = 0.9045$.
$E_{max} = (0.9045)^5 \approx 0.605$.

Let's verify the derivation. The problem statement implies that the final light is horizontally polarized. This means the transmission axis of the last polarizer must be horizontal.

Consider the case where we have $N$ polarizers. The angles of the transmission axes are $\theta_1, \theta_2, ..., \theta_N$.
The input polarization is at $0^\circ$. The final polarization is at $90^\circ$.
The transmission axis of the last polarizer is at $90^\circ$, so $\theta_N = 90^\circ$.

The angles are relative to the vertical.
Efficiency $E = \cos^2 \theta_1 \cos^2(\theta_2 - \theta_1) ... \cos^2(\theta_N - \theta_{N-1})$.
Here $\theta_N = 90^\circ$.

Consider the angles between consecutive polarization directions.
Initial polarization $0^\circ$.
After polarizer 1, polarization at $\theta_1$. Change $= \theta_1 - 0 = \theta_1$.
After polarizer 2, polarization at $\theta_2$. Change relative to previous $= \theta_2 - \theta_1$.
After polarizer $k$, polarization at $\theta_k$. Change relative to previous $= \theta_k - \theta_{k-1}$.

The angles of the transmission axes should be such that the final polarization is horizontal.
Let the angles of the transmission axes be $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_5$.
Initial polarization $0^\circ$.
After polarizer 1, polarization at $\alpha_1$, intensity $I_0 \cos^2 \alpha_1$.
After polarizer 2, polarization at $\alpha_2$, intensity $I_0 \cos^2 \alpha_1 \cos^2(\alpha_2 - \alpha_1)$.
After polarizer 5, polarization at $\alpha_5$, intensity $I_0 \cos^2 \alpha_1 \cos^2(\alpha_2 - \alpha_1) \cos^2(\alpha_3 - \alpha_2) \cos^2(\alpha_4 - \alpha_3) \cos^2(\alpha_5 - \alpha_4)$.
The final polarization must be horizontal, so $\alpha_5 = 90^\circ$.

Efficiency $E = \cos^2 \alpha_1 \cos^2(\alpha_2 - \alpha_1) \cos^2(\alpha_3 - \alpha_2) \cos^2(\alpha_4 - \alpha_3) \cos^2(90^\circ - \alpha_4)$
$E = \cos^2 \alpha_1 \cos^2(\alpha_2 - \alpha_1) \cos^2(\alpha_3 - \alpha_2) \cos^2(\alpha_4 - \alpha_3) \sin^2 \alpha_4$.

Let the changes in angle be $\Delta \phi_i$.
$\alpha_1 = \Delta \phi_1$.
$\alpha_2 - \alpha_1 = \Delta \phi_2$.
$\alpha_3 - \alpha_2 = \Delta \phi_3$.
$\alpha_4 - \alpha_3 = \Delta \phi_4$.
$90^\circ - \alpha_4 = \Delta \phi_5$.

Sum of changes: $\Delta \phi_1 + \Delta \phi_2 + \Delta \phi_3 + \Delta \phi_4 + \Delta \phi_5 = \alpha_1 + (\alpha_2 - \alpha_1) + (\alpha_3 - \alpha_2) + (\alpha_4 - \alpha_3) + (90^\circ - \alpha_4) = 90^\circ$.

Efficiency $E = \cos^2(\Delta \phi_1) \cos^2(\Delta \phi_2) \cos^2(\Delta \phi_3) \cos^2(\Delta \phi_4) \cos^2(\Delta \phi_5)$.
We need to maximize this subject to $\sum_{i=1}^5 \Delta \phi_i = 90^\circ$.

Using the same optimization, we find that $\Delta \phi_1 = \Delta \phi_2 = \Delta \phi_3 = \Delta \phi_4 = \Delta \phi_5 = \frac{90^\circ}{5} = 18^\circ$.

$\alpha_1 = 18^\circ$.
$\alpha_2 - \alpha_1 = 18^\circ \implies \alpha_2 = 36^\circ$.
$\alpha_3 - \alpha_2 = 18^\circ \implies \alpha_3 = 54^\circ$.
$\alpha_4 - \alpha_3 = 18^\circ \implies \alpha_4 = 72^\circ$.
$90^\circ - \alpha_4 = 18^\circ \implies \alpha_4 = 72^\circ$.

The angles of the transmission axes are $18^\circ, 36^\circ, 54^\circ, 72^\circ, 90^\circ$.

Maximum efficiency $E_{max} = (\cos^2 18^\circ)^5$.

Consider the problem statement carefully. We are changing vertically polarized light to horizontally polarized light. The final light after passing through the series of polarizers must be horizontally polarized.

The transmission axis of the last polarizer must be horizontal (at $90^\circ$ with respect to the initial vertical polarization).

The angles of the transmission axes are $0 < \theta_1 < \theta_2 < ... < \theta_N = 90^\circ$.

Let the angles of the transmission axes be chosen such that the change in angle between consecutive polarizers is constant.
$\theta_i - \theta_{i-1} = \frac{90^\circ}{N}$.
$\theta_1 = \frac{90^\circ}{N}$.
$\theta_2 = 2 \frac{90^\circ}{N}$.
...
$\theta_N = N \frac{90^\circ}{N} = 90^\circ$.

The intensity after each polarizer:
$I_1 = I_0 \cos^2(\theta_1 - 0) = I_0 \cos^2(\frac{90^\circ}{N})$.
$I_2 = I_1 \cos^2(\theta_2 - \theta_1) = I_1 \cos^2(\frac{90^\circ}{N}) = I_0 \cos^4(\frac{90^\circ}{N})$.
$I_N = I_0 \left( \cos^2(\frac{90^\circ}{N}) \right)^N = I_0 \cos^{2N}(\frac{90^\circ}{N})$.

Efficiency = $\frac{I_N}{I_0} = \cos^{2N}(\frac{90^\circ}{N})$.

For $N=5$, efficiency = $\cos^{10}(\frac{90^\circ}{5}) = \cos^{10}(18^\circ)$.
This assumes that the angles between consecutive transmission axes are equal.

The problem seems to align with Malus's law applied sequentially. The key is to choose the angles of the polarizers optimally.
The optimal arrangement is when the angle between the transmission axes of consecutive polarizers is constant.

Final check of the reasoning:
We need to rotate the polarization by $90^\circ$ in $N$ steps. The most efficient way to do this is to divide the rotation equally among the steps.
The angle between the polarization direction before and after each polarizer should be the same.

Consider the polarization direction after each polarizer.
Initial: $0^\circ$.
After polarizer 1: $\theta_1$.
After polarizer 2: $\theta_2$.
...
After polarizer $N$: $\theta_N = 90^\circ$.

The change in polarization angle at each step is constant: $\frac{90^\circ}{N}$.
The transmission axis of the $i$-th polarizer should be at an angle such that the outgoing polarization is advanced by $\frac{90^\circ}{N}$.
Transmission axis of polarizer 1: $\frac{90^\circ}{N}$.
Transmission axis of polarizer 2: $2 \frac{90^\circ}{N}$.
...
Transmission axis of polarizer $N$: $N \frac{90^\circ}{N} = 90^\circ$.

The angle between the polarization before the $i$-th polarizer and the transmission axis of the $i$-th polarizer is also $\frac{90^\circ}{N}$.
Intensity after $i$-th polarizer = Intensity before $\times \cos^2(\frac{90^\circ}{N})$.

<text>Let $\Delta \alpha_i = \Delta \alpha$.
$\sum_{i=1}^N \Delta \alpha = N \Delta \alpha = 90^\circ$.
$\Delta \alpha = \frac{90^\circ}{N}$.

The optimal angles between consecutive polarizers are equal.
$\Delta \alpha_i = \frac{90^\circ}{N}$.

The angles of the transmission axes are:
$\theta_1 = \frac{90^\circ}{N}$
$\theta_2 = 2 \frac{90^\circ}{N}$
...
$\theta_N = N \frac{90^\circ}{N} = 90^\circ$.</text>
<explanation>The solver manipulates the equations to determine the optimal angles, finding that they should be equally spaced between 0° and 90°. This algebraic work transforms the optimization result into a practical formula for the angles.</explanation>

<text>We need to calculate $\cos 18^\circ$.
Let $\theta = 18^\circ$, then $5\theta = 90^\circ$.
$2\theta = 36^\circ$, $3\theta = 54^\circ$.
$2\theta + 3\theta = 90^\circ$.
$\sin(2\theta) = \sin(90^\circ - 3\theta) = \cos(3\theta)$.
$2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta$.
Since $\cos \theta \neq 0$, we can divide by $\cos \theta$:
$2 \sin \theta = 4 \cos^2 \theta - 3 = 4(1 - \sin^2 \theta) - 3 = 4 - 4 \sin^2 \theta - 3 = 1 - 4 \sin^2 \theta$.
$4 \sin^2 \theta + 2 \sin \theta - 1 = 0$.

Let $x = \sin \theta$. $4x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0$.
$x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4(4)(-1)}}{8} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 16}}{8} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{20}}{8} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{4}$.
Since $\sin 18^\circ > 0$, $\sin 18^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4}$.

$\cos^2 18^\circ = 1 - \sin^2 18^\circ = 1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{5 + 1 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16} = 1 - \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16} = 1 - \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{8 - 3 + \sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{8}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver employs advanced trigonometric techniques to find the exact value of cos(18°). This involves using angle addition formulas, trigonometric identities, and solving a quadratic equation to express sin(18°) in terms of radicals, then using the Pythagorean identity to find cos²(18°).</explanation>
