Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
The first equation is an integral equation of the Volterra type.
$x(t) = 1 + \int_0^t e^{-2(t-s)}x(s)ds$
$x(t) = 1 + e^{-2t} \int_0^t e^{2s}x(s)ds$
Multiply by $e^{2t}$:
$e^{2t}x(t) = e^{2t} + \int_0^t e^{2s}x(s)ds$
Differentiate both sides with respect to t:
$2e^{2t}x(t) + e^{2t}x'(t) = 2e^{2t} + e^{2t}x(t)$
Divide by $e^{2t}$:
$2x(t) + x'(t) = 2 + x(t)$
$x'(t) = 2 - x(t)$
This is a first-order linear differential equation.
$x'(t) + x(t) = 2$
Integrating factor is $e^{\int 1 dt} = e^t$.
Multiply by $e^t$:
$e^t x'(t) + e^t x(t) = 2e^t$
$\frac{d}{dt}(e^t x(t)) = 2e^t$
Integrate both sides with respect to t:
$\int \frac{d}{dt}(e^t x(t)) dt = \int 2e^t dt$
$e^t x(t) = 2e^t + C$
$x(t) = 2 + Ce^{-t}$
Use the initial condition from the integral equation:
$x(0) = 1 + \int_0^0 e^{-2(0-s)}x(s)ds = 1 + 0 = 1$
$x(0) = 2 + Ce^{-0} = 2 + C = 1$
$C = 1 - 2 = -1$
So, $x(t) = 2 - e^{-t}$.

Now consider the second equation:
$y(t) = \int_0^t e^{-2(t-s)} \{2x(s) + 3y(s)\} ds$
$y(t) = e^{-2t} \int_0^t e^{2s} \{2x(s) + 3y(s)\} ds$
$y(t) = e^{-2t} \int_0^t e^{2s} \{2(2-e^{-s}) + 3y(s)\} ds$
$y(t) = e^{-2t} \int_0^t \{4e^{2s} - 2e^{s} + 3e^{2s}y(s)\} ds$
Multiply by $e^{2t}$:
$e^{2t}y(t) = \int_0^t \{4e^{2s} - 2e^{s} + 3e^{2s}y(s)\} ds$
Differentiate both sides with respect to t:
$2e^{2t}y(t) + e^{2t}y'(t) = 4e^{2t} - 2e^t + 3e^{2t}y(t)$
Divide by $e^{2t}$:
$2y(t) + y'(t) = 4 - 2e^{-t} + 3y(t)$
$y'(t) = 4 - 2e^{-t} + y(t)$
$y'(t) - y(t) = 4 - 2e^{-t}$
This is a first-order linear differential equation.
Integrating factor is $e^{\int -1 dt} = e^{-t}$.
Multiply by $e^{-t}$:
$e^{-t}y'(t) - e^{-t}y(t) = 4e^{-t} - 2e^{-2t}$
$\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-t}y(t)) = 4e^{-t} - 2e^{-2t}$
Integrate both sides with respect to t:
$\int \frac{d}{dt}(e^{-t}y(t)) dt = \int (4e^{-t} - 2e^{-2t}) dt$
$e^{-t}y(t) = -4e^{-t} + e^{-2t} + C$
$y(t) = -4 + e^{-t} + Ce^{t}$
Use the initial condition from the integral equation:
$y(0) = \int_0^0 e^{-2(0-s)} \{2x(s) + 3y(s)\} ds = 0$
$y(0) = -4 + e^{-0} + Ce^{0} = -4 + 1 + C = 0$
$-3 + C = 0$
$C = 3$
So, $y(t) = -4 + e^{-t} + 3e^{t}$.

Check the solutions.
For x(t):
$1+\int_{0}^{t}e^{-2(t-s)}x(s)ds = 1 + e^{-2t} \int_0^t e^{2s} (2-e^{-s}) ds = 1 + e^{-2t} \int_0^t (2e^{2s} - e^s) ds = 1 + e^{-2t} [e^{2s} - e^s]_0^t = 1 + e^{-2t} (e^{2t} - e^t - (1-1)) = 1 + 1 - e^{-t} = 2 - e^{-t} = x(t)$.
For y(t):
$\int_{0}^{t}e^{-2(t-s)}\{2x(s)+3y(s)\}ds = e^{-2t} \int_0^t e^{2s} \{2(2-e^{-s}) + 3(-4+e^{-s}+3e^s)\} ds = e^{-2t} \int_0^t \{4e^{2s} - 2e^s -12e^{2s} + 3e^s + 9e^{3s}\} ds = e^{-2t} \int_0^t \{-8e^{2s} + e^s + 9e^{3s}\} ds = e^{-2t} [-4e^{2s} + e^s + 3e^{3s}]_0^t = e^{-2t} (-4e^{2t} + e^t + 3e^{3t} - (-4+1+3)) = -4 + e^{-t} + 3e^t - e^{-2t}(0) = -4 + e^{-t} + 3e^t = y(t)$.
