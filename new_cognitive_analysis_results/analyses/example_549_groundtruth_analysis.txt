Problem:
 $K(x, y), f(x)$  and  $g(x)$  are positive and continuous for  $x, y \subseteq [0, 1]$ .  $\int_{0}^{1} f(y) K(x, y) dy = g(x)$  and  $\int_{0}^{1} g(y) K(x, y) dy = f(x)$  for all  $x \subseteq [0, 1]$ . Show that  $f = g$  on  $[0, 1]$ .

Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Define the constant \( c \):**
   Let \( c = \min\left(\inf_{x \in [0,1]} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}, \inf_{x \in [0,1]} \frac{g(x)}{f(x)}\right) \). Since \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are positive and continuous on the compact interval \([0,1]\), the infimums are achieved, and thus \( c \) is well-defined and positive.

2. **Identify the point where the minimum is achieved:**
   By the definition of \( c \), there exists some \( a \in [0,1] \) such that \( c = \frac{f(a)}{g(a)} \) or \( c = \frac{g(a)}{f(a)} \). Without loss of generality, assume \( c = \frac{f(a)}{g(a)} \). This implies \( f(a) = c g(a) \).

3. **Establish inequalities:**
   Since \( c \) is the minimum of the ratios, we have:
   \[
   \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \geq c \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{g(x)}{f(x)} \geq c \quad \text{for all } x \in [0,1].
   \]
   These inequalities can be rewritten as:
   \[
   f(x) \geq c g(x) \quad \text{and} \quad g(x) \geq c f(x) \quad \text{for all } x \in [0,1].
   \]

4. **Combine the inequalities:**
   From the inequalities \( f(x) \geq c g(x) \) and \( g(x) \geq c f(x) \), we get:
   \[
   f(x) - c g(x) \geq 0 \quad \text{and} \quad g(x) - c f(x) \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } x \in [0,1].
   \]

5. **Evaluate the integral at the point \( a \):**
   Consider the given integral equation at \( x = a \):
   \[
   g(a) = \int_0^1 f(y) K(a, y) \, dy.
   \]
   Substitute \( f(y) = c g(y) \) into the integral:
   \[
   g(a) = \int_0^1 c g(y) K(a, y) \, dy = c \int_0^1 g(y) K(a, y) \, dy.
   \]
   Using the second given integral equation:
   \[
   \int_0^1 g(y) K(a, y) \, dy = f(a).
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   g(a) = c f(a).
   \]
   Since \( f(a) = c g(a) \), we have:
   \[
   g(a) = c (c g(a)) = c^2 g(a).
   \]
   Given that \( g(a) \neq 0 \) (since \( g(x) \) is positive), we can divide both sides by \( g(a) \):
   \[
   1 = c^2.
   \]
   Thus, \( c = 1 \) (since \( c \) is positive).

6. **Conclude that \( f = g \):**
   Since \( c = 1 \), we have \( f(x) = g(x) \) for all \( x \in [0,1] \).

   g(a) = \int_0^1 c g(y) K(a, y) \, dy = c \int_0^1 g(y) K(a, y) \, dy.

   Let \( c = \min\left(\inf_{x \in [0,1]} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}, \inf_{x \in [0,1]} \frac{g(x)}{f(x)}\right) \). Since \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are positive and continuous on the compact interval \([0,1]\), the infimums are achieved, and thus \( c \) is well-defined and positive.

   \]
   Substitute \( f(y) = c g(y) \) into the integral:
   \[
   g(a) = \int_0^1 c g(y) K(a, y) \, dy = c \int_0^1 g(y) K(a, y) \, dy.
   \]
   Using the second given integral equation:
   \[
   \int_0^1 g(y) K(a, y) \, dy = f(a).
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   g(a) = c f(a).
   \]
   Since \( f(a) = c g(a) \), we have:
   \[
   g(a) = c (c g(a)) = c^2 g(a).
