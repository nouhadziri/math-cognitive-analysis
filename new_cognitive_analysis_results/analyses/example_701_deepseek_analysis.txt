Problem:
A load dissipates 1.5kW of power in an ac series RC circuit. Given that the power factor is 0.75, what is its reactive power $(P_r)$? What is its apparent power $(P_a)$? Represent the answer in a list [$P_r, P_a$] with unit kVA and kVAR respectively.

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to find the reactive power (P_r) and the apparent power (P_a) in an AC series RC circuit. The load dissipates 1.5kW of power, and the power factor is 0.75. Alright, let's start by recalling what these terms mean.

Power in AC circuits can be a bit tricky because of the phase difference between voltage and current. The real power (P) is the actual power consumed by the resistive part of the load, which is given here as 1.5kW. The apparent power (P_a) is the product of the RMS voltage and RMS current, so it's the total power that seems to be supplied to the circuit. The reactive power (P_r) is the power that oscillates between the source and the reactive components (like capacitors and inductors) and isn't consumed.

The power factor (pf) is the cosine of the phase angle between the voltage and current, so pf = cosθ = 0.75. This tells us how much of the apparent power is actually doing real work. Since it's an RC circuit, the reactive power will be capacitive, but the problem just asks for the magnitude, so maybe the sign doesn't matter here.

From what I remember, real power (P) is related to apparent power (P_a) via the power factor. The formula is P = P_a * pf. So if I rearrange that, P_a = P / pf. That should give me the apparent power. Then, reactive power (P_r) can be found using the power triangle, where (P_a)^2 = P^2 + (P_r)^2. So solving for P_r, it's sqrt((P_a)^2 - P^2). But maybe there's a direct formula using the power factor.

Alternatively, since power factor is cosθ, we can find the angle θ as arccos(0.75). Then, reactive power is P_r = P_a * sinθ. But then I need to compute sinθ if I already have cosθ.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the relationship where the pf = cosθ = P / P_a, so we can compute P_a first as P / cosθ. Then, using the power triangle, the reactive power Q (which is P_r) would be P_a * sinθ. Since sinθ = sqrt(1 - cos2θ), that might be another way. Let me check:

Given cosθ = 0.75, so sinθ = sqrt(1 - 0.75^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.5625) = sqrt(0.4375). Let me calculate that: sqrt(0.4375) ≈ 0.6614. So then, Q = P_a * sinθ.

But since P_a is P / cosθ, substituting that in: Q = (P / cosθ) * sinθ = P * tanθ. Since tanθ = sinθ / cosθ. So tanθ would be 0.6614 / 0.75 ≈ 0.8819. So Q = 1.5kW * 0.8819 ≈ 1.3228 kVAR. So that should be the reactive power.

Alternatively, from the power triangle, Q = sqrt(P_a^2 - P^2). Let's compute P_a first: 1.5kW / 0.75 = 2kVA. So apparent power is 2kVA. Then Q = sqrt((2kVA)^2 - (1.5kW)^2) = sqrt(4 - 2.25) = sqrt(1.75) ≈ 1.3229 kVAR. Which matches the previous result. So both methods confirm that Q is approximately 1.3229 kVAR. So reactive power is approximately 1.32 kVAR, but maybe I need to be precise.

Wait, sqrt(1.75) is exactly sqrt(7/4), which is (sqrt7)/2 ≈ 1.3228756... So approximately 1.3229 kVAR, which rounds to 1.32 kVAR. But let me check whether the problem expects exact values or rounded decimals.

Alternatively, actually, perhaps using the exact fractions:

Given cosθ = 0.75 = 3/4. So θ = arccos(3/4). Thus, sinθ = sqrt(1 - 9/16) = sqrt(7/16) = sqrt7 / 4 ≈ 2.6458/4 ≈ 0.6614. Therefore, sinθ = sqrt7/4.

Therefore, Q = P_a sinθ = (1.5kW / 0.75) * (sqrt7/4). Let's calculate that:

1.5kW / 0.75 = 2kVA. So 2kVA * (sqrt7 /4) = (2 * sqrt7)/4 = sqrt7/2 ≈ 1.3229 kVAR. So exact value is sqrt(7)/2 kVAR, although decimal is approximately 1.3229.

Similarly, apparent power P_a is 2kVA.

So the answers should be reactive power Q = sqrt7/2 kVAR ≈1.3229 kVAR, and apparent power P_a =2 kVA.

But the problem says the unit for P_r is kVAR and P_a is kVA. Let me check the question again.

It says: "What is its reactive power (P_r)? What is its apparent power (P_a)? Represent the answer in a list [P_r, P_a] with unit kVA and kVAR respectively."

Wait, wait. Hold on. The list is [P_r, P_a], but each with unit kVA and kVAR respectively? Wait, that can't be. If [P_r, P_a], then P_r should be kVAR and P_a is kVA, right? Because reactive power is in kilovolt-amps reactive (kVAR) and apparent power is in kilovolt-amps (kVA). So that makes sense. So in the list, first element is P_r in kVAR, second is P_a in kVA.

So, therefore, the answer is [1.3229 kVAR, 2 kVA], approximately. Let me check if 0.75 is indeed 3/4, and sqrt(1 - 0.75^2) ≈ 0.6614... which when multiplied by apparent power 2kVA gives 2 * 0.6614 ≈1.3228 kVAR, yes.

But since the real power is 1.5kW, power factor is 0.75, and so P_a = 1.5 /0.75 = 2kVA. Then Q = sqrt(P_a^2 - P^2) = sqrt(4 -2.25)= sqrt(1.75)= approx 1.3229.

Alternatively, using power factor given, and Q = P tan(theta). Since pf is cos(theta)=0.75, then tan(theta) is sqrt(1 - (0.75)^2)/0.75 = sqrt(7/16)/ (3/4) )= (sqrt7 /4) / (3/4) )= sqrt7 /3 ≈ 0.8819, hence Q=1.5kW * 0.8819≈1.3229 kVAR. So same result.

So yes, both ways you get approx 1.3229 kVAR. Unless perhaps I made an error in calculations.

Alternatively, for exact value, sqrt(1.75) is sqrt(7/4), which is sqrt7 /2. So this is an exact expression, maybe acceptable to leave it as sqrt(7)/2, but the problem says to use kVAR and kVA units. So I guess we need to enter it as numerical values, either exact if possible or as a decimal. The problem says "represent the answer in a list [Pr, Pa] with unit kVA and kVAR respectively". Wait, but do I need to convert to decimals or leave as exact? Let me see.

It just says "unit kVA and kVAR respectively," so probably the numerical values with the units. For instance, if exact, then [ (sqrt(7)/2) kVAR, 2 kVA ]? However, sqrt(7)/2 is approximately 1.322, but not sure if exact form is needed. Since it's engineering, probably decimal, maybe to three decimal places or so.

But I'll check the question again: It says, in the problem statement: "dissipates 1.5kW of power", power factor 0.75, "what is its reactive power (P_r)"... Probably they just expect to calculate it approximately.

Wait, since the original numbers are given with two significant figures (1.5kW is two sf, 0.75 is two as well?), so perhaps the answer should be given to two sig figs.

1.5kW if it's two sig figs, but sometimes 1.5 is two significant figures (the 1 is significant, and 5 is second). Similarly 0.75 is two significant figures. So then answers should be given with two significant figures.

In that case:

P_a is 1.5kW /0.75 = 2.0kW / power factor, but since 1.5 /0.75 = 2. Exactly 2, so 2.0 kVA. So that's actually exact. So apparent power is exactly 2 kVA? Since 1.5 divided by 0.75 is 2.0. So yes.

Reactive power would be sqrt( (2.0)^2 - (1.5)^2 ) = sqrt(4 -2.25)= sqrt(1.75)= about 1.3229 kVAR. If we need to take two significant figures, that would be 1.3 kVAR. Hmm, but the original given: 1.5kW is two sig figs, 0.75 is two? Wait, 0.75 is two decimal places, but in sig figs, it's two: the 7 and 5, since leading zeros don't count. But in 0.75, the 0 is not a significant figure, so two sig figs: 7 and 5. Similarly 1.5kW is two sig figs.

Therefore, resulting answers should be 1.3 kVAR (two sig figs) and 2.0 kVA (exactly two, since computation gives exactly 2.0). Wait, even if the computation gives exactly 2.0? So 2.0 kVA is two sig figs? Wait, 2.0 is two sig figs. So 2.0 kVA. And reactive power is 1.3 kVAR. But let me check sqrt(1.75):

sqrt(1.75) ≈1.3229, which is approximately 1.32. If I take two sig figs, becomes 1.3. But 1.3229 to two sig figs is 1.3. Alternatively, since if you compute using Q = P * tan(theta), with P=1.5kW, tan(theta)=0.8819, Q=1.5 *0.8819=1.32285, so with two sig figs, 1.3 kVAR. Alternatively, considering 1.5 has two sig figs, 0.75 also two, so angle is arccos(0.75). Maybe the computation is supposed to carry over three digits?

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using exact fractions. For instance, Q = (sqrt(1 - 0.75^2 )) * P_a. Since P_a=2.0kVA, so Q = 2 * sqrt(1 - 0.75^2). Let's compute:

sqrt(1 - 0.5625)=sqrt(0.4375)=sqrt(7/16)=sqrt7/4≈0.6614. Then P_r=2 * 0.6614≈1.3228. So when rounded to two decimal places, it's 1.32 kVAR. Maybe the question expects three significant figures here, but since inputs 1.5 and 0.75 are two and two decimal precision.

Wait: 1.5 is ambiguous because it could be two significant figures, or possibly intended as exact. The same with 0.75—could be exactly 0.75, with infinite precision. The power is given as 1.5kW. If it's, say, 1.5 exactly, then we can write the answer with as many decimals as needed.

Alternatively, in the absence of explicit instruction on decimal places, perhaps to answer with three significant figures as that's sort of standard for engineering problems. So Q ≈1.32 kVAR and P_a =2.00 kVA.

But in the given problem, since 1.5kW is 1.5 (which can be read as three significant figures—though the trailing zero after decimal is considered significant only if specified), but 1.5 is two sig figs. Similarly, 0.75 is also two sig figs (but here, since it's a power factor, the number is typically given as a precise decimal (if specified then maybe at higher precision). However, perhaps in this case, with the data given, to present the answers with two significant figures.

Alternatively, since P_a comes out exactly 2.0, which is effectively two sig figs (if 2.0, as two), and then reactive power about 1.3 kVAR.

But wait, in typical electrical engineering contexts, power, reactive power, etc., are usually given to a couple decimal places when dealing with values in the thousands (kW, kVA, kVAR). So maybe 1.32 kVAR is acceptable here. Let's verify this through calculation again.

Given exact Pi:

P = 1.5 kW (real power)

Power factor (pf) = 0.75 → cosθ = 0.75

Apparent power (P_a) = P / pf = 1.5 kW /0.75 = 2 kVA (exactly, so it's 2.000... kVA. So written as 2 kVA)

Reactive power (Q) = sqrt(P_a2 - P2) = sqrt(4 - 2.25) = sqrt(1.75) ≈1.3228756557 kVAR

Since sqrt(1.75) is irrational, we can’t write it as an exact decimal. So, depending on rounding, either one decimal: 1.3 kVAR, two decimals: 1.32 kVAR, three: 1.323 kVAR.

Common practice in engineering is to use either two decimal places or three significant figures. So given that the original numbers (1.5 and 0.75) are each two significant figures, then perhaps the answers should also have two significant figures. Therefore, P_r ≈1.3 kVAR, and P_a=2.0 kVA.

But another school of thought is that since the number 1.5 is two sig figs and 0.75 is two sig figs, the multiplication/division can allow for more precision. For instance, in practice, when multiplying/dividing, the result should have the same number of sig figs as the least precise term. Here, 1.5 has two and 0.75 also two, so maybe 2.0 kVA is two sig figs. Then, sqrt(1.75)=1.3228..., so here we ended up with a calculation where the number of sig figs would be dictated by the input. However, in subtraction or addition, the decimal places are considered.

But sqrt(1.75) is based on numbers from the given data. Wait, the 1.75 comes from 2.0^2 - 1.5^2=4.0 -2.25=1.75. If 2.0 is two sig figs and 1.5 is two sig figs, then 1.75 would be three sig figs, but the issue here is subtraction. 4.0 (from 2.0^2 assuming two sig figs) minus 2.25 (from 1.5^2, which has two sig figs but written as 2.25 with three sig figs). This is getting into precision which is perhaps beyond the scope here. The problem might just want the calculation done assuming exact numbers, so sqrt(1.75). Alternatively, maybe the choices after calculation, but given that this is an exercise, perhaps 1.32 kVAR is expected for reactive power. Since the question's answer needs to be in a list with units, it's essential to check how the numbers are presented.

Originally, 1.5kW is 1500W, but given as 1.5kW, so that's tenths of kW, two decimal places if written as 1.50kW it'd be three sig figs, but as written, it is probably two, the 1 and 5. But given 0.75 is exact (like a defined power factor) or 0.750? Unless the significance is a concern, anyway, perhaps use three significant figures.

But if 1.32 is three significant figures (1.32 - three), but perhaps the question intends two. Without more context, it's challenging, but likely due to P_a being exactly 2.0 kVA (two significant figures), and Q being approx 1.32 kVAR. The exact value can be represented as sqrt(7)/2, but as per engineering standards, we usually go with decimal.

Alternatively, check standard formulas for reactive power: Q = P * tan(theta). Here, pf = cos(theta) =0.75. So tan(theta) = sqrt(1 - (0.75)^2)/0.75 = sqrt(0.4375)/0.75≈0.6614/0.75≈0.8819. So Q =1.5 *0.8819≈1.3228 kVAR. Approx 1.32.

So given possible options, 1.32 kVAR when rounded to three significant figures (1.32 is three), given that 1.5 is two, perhaps this is appropriate. Alternatively, 1.3 kVAR if two sig figs.

However, considering that the apparent power calculation gives exactly 2, maybe precise enough, and the 0.75 is two decimal places. So based on that, maybe they expect 1.32 kVAR and 2 kVA. Another way is the question says "the answer in a list [Pr, Pa] with unit kVA and kVAR respectively." So probably leave them as exact decimal values as per calculations. But when they ask to put units kVA and kVAR respectively. Since Pr is reactive power, so in kVAR, Pa is apparent in kVA. So, for example:

Pr ≈ 1.3229 kVAR rounded to 1.32 kVAR. Pa is exactly 2.00 kVA.

But if they want, say, two decimal places, we can write 1.32 kVAR and 2.00 kVA.

But check if perhaps the answer requires more formal decimal places. Let me now remember that in the power factor problems, reactive power is usually calculated to match the significant figures of the given data.

Given that both the real power (1.5 kW) and power factor (0.75) are given with two significant figures, both Pr and Pa should be presented with two significant figures. So Pr is 1.3 kVAR and Pa is 2.0 kVA, as 1.3228... is rounded to 1.3 (two sig figs).

Wait, but 1.3228... Rounded to two significant figures is 1.3. Since the first digit is 1, second is 3, third is 2, which is less than 5, so it truncates to 1.3. Similarly, Pa is exactly 2.0, which is also two significant figures.

Alternatively, if 1.5kW is considered three significant figures (if 1.50kW then), but as written with one decimal, but no, 1.5 has two digits. 0.75 is two decimal places but just two sig figs too.

So ultimately, taking into account significant figures, the answers should be:

Reactive power, Pr =1.3 kVAR

Apparent power, Pa= 2.0 kVA

But for instances where Q is computed as 1.3228, rounding to two significant figures gives 1.3. So both results are represented with two sig figs.

Alternatively, in some contexts, even after division or sqrt, the consideration might be different, but generally, when performing multi-step calculations, you should keep intermediate values to higher precision and only round at the end. So if we keep to three significant figures during intermediate steps, then the final answer could have two. Hmmm.

But given this is a problem for study, the exact answer as per calculation [1.3228..., 2.0...], but written in a certain number of decimal places. Since they didn't specify decimals, I think safe to use three with the exact numerical value computed.

But let me check examples from textbooks or online. For example, how another source might do.

Suppose real power is 1.5kW, power factor 0.75. Then apparent power is 1.5 /0.75=2kVA exactly, then reactive power Q = sqrt(2^2 -1.5^2)=sqrt(4-2.25)=sqrt(1.75)=1.3228k kVAR≈1.32 kVAR.

So textbooks would often present 1.32 kVAR. Which is three significant figures. Since sqrt(1.75)≈1.3228, which is approx 1.323, but three sig figs 1.32.

Hmm.

Alternatively, if the options are in decimals, like in multiple-choice, they'd have either exact using sqrt, but this is boxed answer, so I would give approx to three sig figs. So 1.32 kVAR and 2.00 kVA.

Alternatively, again, if the original numbers consider 1.5 has two sig figs, and 0.75 also two, then results are two sig figs. So write 1.3 kkvar and 2.0 kVA.

But in P_a, if it's exact, 2 kVA is also acceptable (2 rather than 2.0). Given that, if P_a is exactly 2. Then Pa=2kVA, written as 2kVA.

Q is approximately 1.3228≈1.32 kVAR. So in three sig figures: 1.32 kVAR, but 1.5 and 0.75 are two sig figs, making the final answers two sig figs: 1.3kvar and 2.0kVA.

But wait, 2kVA is exactly two sig figs. If you write just 2kVA, that's one sig fig, only the 2. If you write 2.0 kVA, that's two. So maybe better to write 2.0 kVA.

Yes. So the problem wants to have units of kVA and kVAR. So [Pr (kVAR), Pa (kVA)]

Thus, here's the conclusion:

Using Pr=1.3228...≈1.32kvar (3 sig figs) or 1.3 (2 sig figs). The question may want exact answer?

Alternatively, let me test. Let me compute sqrt(1.75). 1.3228... So for engineering answers, which are often three digits, it is better to present 1.32 kVAR. So 1.32 kVAR and 2.00 kVA. But the 2.00, in this case may or may not have the decimal, but as mentioned, if original P was 1.5 with two sig figs, writing Pa as 2.0 maintains two sig figs.

Alternatively, different. For example, some textbooks write 2 kVA, without the decimal. So technically, 2 kVA could be 1 sig fig, but given the context and Pa being 1.5 /0.75=2, as exact. But power factor problems, if the power factor is exact (0.75 maybe is 3⁄4, a fraction), then the apparent power as 2kVA exact.

Alternatively, given the problem is from a textbook, perhaps giving symbolic answer.

But I think the standard approach here is maybe, for reactive power, Q=P * tan(arccos(0.75)) approx 1.5 *0.8819≈1.323 kVAR, and 2.00kVA.

But all things considered, the safest answer given the question's parameters is [1.32 kVAR, 2.00 kVA], but if strictly considering significant figures, then [1.3 kVAR, 2.0 kVA].

Alternatively, the problem says that a Load dissipates 1.5kW- that's exact, power factor 0.75- also exact. Probably in the absence of information on precision, assume the numbers are exact, so answer should be exact.

sqrt(1.75)=sqrt(7/4)= (√7)/2≈1.3228... Thus, if asked for exact, would be √7/2, but maybe necessary in decimals. Since 1.3228 is closer to 1322.8 VAr, which is 1.3228 kVAR. The question asks for unit in kVAR.

If no specification, then decimals should be acceptable, using standard. e.g., [1.32 kVAR, 2 kVA]. Alternatively, if present exact, as sqrt(7)/2 kVAR. But maybe not.

In conclusion, I think we have to box this as [1.32, 2.00] using units as given, but wait, question specifies:

"Represent the answer in a list [Pr, Pa] with unit kVA and kVAR respectively."

But hold on: they say "Pr, Pa with unit kVA and kVAR respectively." Wait, Pr is reactive power, which should be in kVAR, and Pa is apparent power in kVA. So that part is correct.

So how should this look. The answer is (values in order): reactive power in kVAR, apparent power in kVA. Their units are already specified.

So given 1.3228 kVAR and 2 kVA. So writing:

[1.32 kVAR, 2 kVA]. But if this is in the problem’s requested format, they might have required, for example, [1.32, 2] with units, but written with commas and spacing.

Alternatively, maybe precise 1.323 which is three decimal, but unless specified, standard to three digits.

In summary, after reviewing, the most accurate answers given exact terms are [approximately 1.32 kVAR, 2 kVA]. So likely [1.32, 2.0] in their respective units, but the apparent power is exactly 2 kVA.

Wait, since 1.5 divided by 0.75 is exactly 2, so Pa=2kVA (exactly). The reactive power is exactly sqrt( (2)^2 - (1.5)^2 ) = sqrt(1.75)=1.3228... So approximate.

Thus, the answer is [1.32 kVAR, 2.00 kVA] but per units, they mention kVA and kVAR respectively.

So the final answer would be [1.32 kVAR, 2.00 kVA]. But as decimal places, depending on required.

Alternatively, given engineering standards, sometimes we use up to two decimal places. So [1.32 kVAR, 2.00 kVA]

However, since 2.00 kVA could be written as 2 kVA. But without having instructions to do otherwise, use approximate value.

Going back to problem statement:

"A load dissipates 1.5kW of power in an ac series RC circuit. Given that the power factor is 0.75, what is its reactive power (Pr)? What is its apparent power (Pa)? Represent the answer in a list [Pr, Pa] with unit kVA and kVAR respectively."

Given that, answer is [Pr, Pa], which are reactive and apparent with the respective units.

Probably, we should present Pr with the precise three decimals but rounded to two decimals. 1.32 kVAR (which is two decimal places), and Pa as 2 kVA. Since 2 is an exact number, probably 2 kVA.

But often in problems, sometimes they accept fractions or sqrt forms. Wait, if the exact value is requested, but since this is likely looking for numerical values, do decimals.

Alternatively, check: 1.32 in kVAR and 2 in kVA. So [1.32, 2]

But the keying-in problem on internet often requires to following certain decimal points but since I’m instructed to put box around answer. If I need to box the answer as per their requirement.

However, looking back, the question says:

"Represent the answer in a list [Pr, Pa] with unit kVA and kVAR respectively."

Units being respectively applied; so you write the numerical values followed by units. Thus example the answer would be like:

[1.32 kVAR, 2.00 kVA]

But the problem is the system requires the answer in box. Therefore, how to present.

Instructed to: "Represent the answer in a list [Pr, Pa] with unit kVA and kVAR respectively."

Therefore within the format:

[Pr, Pa]

Where Pr is in kVAR, and Pa is in kVA. So the box answer would be boxed as [1.32 kVAR, 2.00 kVA]. However, typically, when units are specified in the question as properties, just numbers in box, but often sometimes units are included. E.g.:

According that:

" the answer in a list [Pr, Pa] with unit kVA and kVAR respectively." So the user intends that: Pr has unit kVAR, Pa has unit kVA. So answer is numerical values linked with units. E.g., [1.32 kVAR, 2.00 kVA]

But in some systems, especially computer-based, they expect the answer to be numbers and units separately set, but as per instruction here, perhaps the units are to be included in the list.

But I think here is important to think of the answer should be expressed with numbers with units, in the order [Pr, Pa]. Therefore:

Reactive power is approximately 1.32 kVAR and apparent power is exactly 2 kVA. So:

[1.32 kVAR, 2 kVA]

But given the possibilities, that seems most sensible. Alternatively, if one prefers 2.0 kVA for two sig figs. So [1.32 kVAR, 2.0 kVA].

However, the given real power is 1.5kW, and calculating to three sig figs for reactive power is justifiable (because even though inputs are two and two, perhaps in engineering three sig figs is typical). So settle on 1.32 kVAR.

Ultimately, in most textbooks I've seen, such a problem rounds to two decimal places or uses three significant figures, depending, hence the answer would be 1.32 kVAR and 2.00 kVA.

Since the question didn't specify significant figures, technically best to keep it as exact decimals as possible.

But since sqrt(1.75) is irrational, we can't write in exact decimal, so approximate to three decimal places: that would be 1.322/1.323.

But for this purpose, I think the answer should be [1.32 kVAR, 2 kVA].

But checking for possible calculation mistake: is reactive power indeed calculated correct? Alternative approach, such as using S = P + jQ.

But I think correct. Therefore.

**Final Answer**
The reactive power \( P_r \) is approximately \( 1.32 \) kVAR and the apparent power \( P_a \) is \( 2 \) kVA. Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{[1.32\ \text{kVAR}, 2\ \text{kVA}]}\).

<text>From what I remember, real power (P) is related to apparent power (P_a) via the power factor. The formula is P = P_a * pf. So if I rearrange that, P_a = P / pf. That should give me the apparent power. Then, reactive power (P_r) can be found using the power triangle, where (P_a)^2 = P^2 + (P_r)^2. So solving for P_r, it's sqrt((P_a)^2 - P^2). But maybe there's a direct formula using the power factor.</text>
<explanation>Here the solver demonstrates understanding of the mathematical relationships between the different types of power, recalling the power triangle concept and deriving the formula for reactive power from first principles rather than just applying a memorized formula.</explanation>

<skill>Formula Recall and Application</skill>
<definition>The ability to remember relevant mathematical formulas and correctly apply them to solve specific problems, including understanding when and how to use particular formulas.</definition>

<start>1022</start>
<end>1244</end>
<text>Alternatively, since power factor is cosθ, we can find the angle θ as arccos(0.75). Then, reactive power is P_r = P_a * sinθ. But then I need to compute sinθ if I already have cosθ.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the relationship where the pf = cosθ = P / P_a, so we can compute P_a first as P / cosθ.</text>
<explanation>The solver recalls multiple formulas for calculating reactive power and evaluates which approach might be more efficient. They demonstrate the ability to manipulate formulas and convert between different representations (using trigonometric relationships) to find the most direct solution path.</explanation>

<start>1245</start>
<end>1462</end>
<text>Then, using the power triangle, the reactive power Q (which is P_r) would be P_a * sinθ. Since sinθ = sqrt(1 - cos2θ), that might be another way. Let me check:

Given cosθ = 0.75, so sinθ = sqrt(1 - 0.75^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.5625) = sqrt(0.4375). Let me calculate that: sqrt(0.4375) ≈ 0.6614.</text>
<explanation>The solver correctly applies the Pythagorean identity to calculate sinθ from cosθ, showing mastery of trigonometric relationships and their application to power calculations. They methodically work through the calculation step by step.</explanation>

<start>1597</start>
<end>1924</end>
<text>Alternatively, from the power triangle, Q = sqrt(P_a^2 - P^2). Let's compute P_a first: 1.5kW / 0.75 = 2kVA. So apparent power is 2kVA. Then Q = sqrt((2kVA)^2 - (1.5kW)^2) = sqrt(4 - 2.25) = sqrt(1.75) ≈ 1.3229 kVAR. Which matches the previous result. So both methods confirm that Q is approximately 1.3229 kVAR.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies an alternative formula derived from the power triangle to calculate reactive power, demonstrating flexibility in approach. They verify that both methods yield the same result, which shows careful application of formulas and understanding of their equivalence.</explanation>

<skill>Verification and Cross-Checking</skill>
<definition>The ability to verify results using alternative methods or approaches, and to check for consistency and reasonableness of answers.</definition>

<start>1925</start>
<end>2142</end>
<text>So reactive power is approximately 1.32 kVAR, but maybe I need to be precise.

Wait, sqrt(1.75) is exactly sqrt(7/4), which is (sqrt7)/2 ≈ 1.3228756... So approximately 1.3229 kVAR, which rounds to 1.32 kVAR. But let me check whether the problem expects exact values or rounded decimals.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies their numerical result by expressing it in exact form (sqrt(7)/2) and then approximating it. They also consider what level of precision might be expected in the answer, showing attention to the requirements of the problem.</explanation>

<start>7158</start>
<end>7497</end>
<text>Alternatively, check: 1.32 in kVAR and 2 in kVA. So [1.32, 2]

But the keying-in problem on internet often requires to following certain decimal points but since I'm instructed to put box around answer. If I need to box the answer as per their requirement.

However, looking back, the question says:

"Represent the answer in a list [Pr, Pa] with unit kVA and kVAR respectively."</text>
<explanation>The solver goes back to verify their understanding of the problem statement and the required format for the answer, ensuring they're presenting their solution correctly. This demonstrates careful attention to the problem requirements and verification of the answer format.</explanation>

<start>8471</start>
<end>8713</end>
<text>But checking for possible calculation mistake: is reactive power indeed calculated correct? Alternative approach, such as using S = P + jQ.

But I think correct. Therefore.

**Final Answer**
The reactive power \( P_r \) is approximately \( 1.32 \) kVAR and the apparent power \( P_a \) is \( 2 \) kVA.</text>
<explanation>Before finalizing the answer, the solver considers whether there might be calculation mistakes and mentions another possible approach using complex power notation (S = P + jQ), showing a commitment to verifying results through multiple methods.</explanation>

<skill>Precision and Units Management</skill>
<definition>The ability to work with appropriate precision, manage significant figures correctly, and handle units consistently throughout calculations.</definition>

<start>3953</start>
<end>4242</end>
<text>Wait, since the original numbers are given with two significant figures (1.5kW is two sf, 0.75 is two as well?), so perhaps the answer should be given to two sig figs.

1.5kW if it's two sig figs, but sometimes 1.5 is two significant figures (the 1 is significant, and 5 is second). Similarly 0.75 is two significant figures. So then answers should be given with two significant figures.</text>
<explanation>The solver carefully analyzes the significant figures in the given values to determine the appropriate precision for the answer. This shows attention to mathematical rigor and understanding of significant figure rules in calculations.</explanation>

<start>4243</start>
<end>4485</end>
<text>In that case:

P_a is 1.5kW /0.75 = 2.0kW / power factor, but since 1.5 /0.75 = 2. Exactly 2, so 2.0 kVA. So that's actually exact. So apparent power is exactly 2 kVA? Since 1.5 divided by 0.75 is 2.0. So yes.

Reactive power would be sqrt( (2.0)^2 - (1.5)^2 ) = sqrt(4 -2.25)= sqrt(1.75)= about 1.3229 kVAR.</text>
<explanation>The solver carefully tracks units and precision throughout calculations, noting that the apparent power calculation yields an exact result while the reactive power calculation yields an approximate result. They maintain consistent units (kVA and kVAR) throughout.</explanation>

<start>4486</start>
<end>4782</end>
<text>If we need to take two significant figures, that would be 1.3 kVAR. Hmm, but the original given: 1.5kW is two sig figs, 0.75 is two? Wait, 0.75 is two decimal places, but in sig figs, it's two: the 7 and 5, since leading zeros don't count. But in 0.75, the 0 is not a significant figure, so two sig figs: 7 and 5. Similarly 1.5kW is two sig figs.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates sophisticated understanding of significant figure rules, correctly analyzing that 0.75 has two significant figures (not counting the leading zero) and that 1.5 kW also has two significant figures. This shows careful attention to precision in scientific calculations.</explanation>

<skill>Self-Monitoring and Metacognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to monitor one's own thinking processes, recognize errors or inconsistencies, and adjust strategies accordingly during problem-solving.</definition>

<start>5789</start>
<end>6103</end>
<text>Wait, wait. Hold on. The list is [P_r, P_a], but each with unit kVA and kVAR respectively? Wait, that can't be. If [P_r, P_a], then P_r should be kVAR and P_a is kVA, right? Because reactive power is in kilovolt-amps reactive (kVAR) and apparent power is in kilovolt-amps (kVA). So that makes sense. So in the list, first element is P_r in kVAR, second is P_a in kVA.</text>
<explanation>The solver catches a potential misunderstanding in the problem statement, questioning whether the units are correctly matched to the quantities. They reason through the appropriate units for each type of power and correct their understanding, demonstrating active monitoring of their own comprehension.</explanation>

<start>6104</start>
<end>6334</end>
<text>So, therefore, the answer is [1.3229 kVAR, 2 kVA], approximately. Let me check if 0.75 is indeed 3/4, and sqrt(1 - 0.75^2) ≈ 0.6614... which when multiplied by apparent power 2kVA gives 2 * 0.6614 ≈1.3228 kVAR, yes.</text>
<explanation>The solver double-checks their calculation by verifying intermediate steps, showing careful monitoring of their solution process. They confirm that their approach is consistent and that the numerical values make sense.</explanation>

<start>7498</start>
<end>7701</end>
<text>Units being respectively applied; so you write the numerical values followed by units. Thus example the answer would be like:

[1.32 kVAR, 2.00 kVA]

But the problem is the system requires the answer in box. Therefore, how to present.</text>
<explanation>The solver is carefully considering how to present their final answer in the required format, showing metacognitive awareness of the need to conform to specific presentation requirements while ensuring the answer is mathematically correct.</explanation>

<skill>Multiple Solution Pathways</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and explore different approaches to solving a problem, evaluating their efficiency and appropriateness for the given context.</definition>

<start>1463</start>
<end>1596</end>
<text>So then, Q = P_a * sinθ.

But since P_a is P / cosθ, substituting that in: Q = (P / cosθ) * sinθ = P * tanθ. Since tanθ = sinθ / cosθ. So tanθ would be 0.6614 / 0.75 ≈ 0.8819. So Q = 1.5kW * 0.8819 ≈ 1.3228 kVAR.</text>
<explanation>The solver derives an alternative formula for reactive power using trigonometric relationships, showing the ability to transform expressions and find more direct calculation paths. This demonstrates flexibility in mathematical thinking and the ability to identify efficient solution methods.</explanation>

<start>2143</start>
<end>2490</end>
<text>Alternatively, actually, perhaps using the exact fractions:

Given cosθ = 0.75 = 3/4. So θ = arccos(3/4). Thus, sinθ = sqrt(1 - 9/16) = sqrt(7/16) = sqrt7 / 4 ≈ 2.6458/4 ≈ 0.6614. Therefore, sinθ = sqrt7/4.

Therefore, Q = P_a sinθ = (1.5kW / 0.75) * (sqrt7/4). Let's calculate that:

1.5kW / 0.75 = 2kVA. So 2kVA * (sqrt7 /4) = (2 * sqrt7)/4 = sqrt7/2 ≈ 1.3229 kVAR.</text>
<explanation>The solver explores yet another approach using exact fractions rather than decimal approximations, demonstrating versatility in mathematical representation. They work through the calculation systematically, showing how the exact form can be derived and then approximated.</explanation>

<start>6335</start>
<end>6603</end>
<text>But since the real power is 1.5kW, power factor is 0.75, and so P_a = 1.5 /0.75 = 2kVA. Then Q = sqrt(P_a^2 - P^2) = sqrt(4 -2.25)= sqrt(1.75)= approx 1.3229.

Alternatively, using power factor given, and Q = P tan(theta). Since pf is cos(theta)=0.75, then tan(theta) is sqrt(1 - (0.75)^2)/0.75 = sqrt(7/16)/ (3/4) )= (sqrt7 /4) / (3/4) )= sqrt7 /3 ≈ 0.8819</text>
<explanation>The solver compares two different approaches to calculating reactive power - one using the power triangle relationship and one using the tangent of the phase angle. This demonstrates the ability to work with multiple solution methods and verify results through different approaches.</explanation>
