Problem:
For any $n \geq 1$, let $A$ denote the $\mathbb{C}$ algebra consisting of $n \times n$ upper triangular complex matrices $\left\{\left(\begin{array}{ccc}* & * & * \\ 0 & * & * \\ 0 & 0 & *\end{array}\right)_{n \times n}\right\}$. We shall consider the left $A$-modules (that is, $\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces $V$ with $\mathbb{C}$-algebra homomorphisms $\rho: A \rightarrow \operatorname{End}(V))$. (2) Determine all simple modules of $A$.

Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
(2a) Let $S_{i}, 1 \leq i \leq n$, denote the 1-dimensional modules such that $E_{i i}$ acts by 1 and $E_{i j}, E_{j j}$ acts by 0 for $j \neq i$. They are simple modules. (2b) It remains to show that the $S_{i}$ we have constructed are the only simple modules. Let $S$ denote any finite dimensional simple module. We claim that $E_{i j}, i<j$, form a nilpotent 2-sided ideal $N$ (because the product of an upper triangular matrix with a strictly upper one is strictly upper). Then $N$ acts on $S$ by 0 (To see this, $N S$ is a submodule of $S$. It is proper because $N$ is nilpotent. Since $S$ is simple, we deduce that $N S=0$.) Note that the action of $E_{i i}$ commute with each other (and with the 0 -action by $E_{i j}$ ), thus they are module endomorphisms. By Schur's Lemma, $E_{i i}$ acts on $S$ as a scalar. Since $E_{i i} E_{j j}=0$ for $i \neq j$, at most one $E_{i i}$ acts as a non-zero scalar. Recall that $1=\sum_{i} E_{i i}$ acts by the identity. The claim follows.

# Analysis of Cognitive Skills in Mathematical Problem-Solving

<skill>Strategic Approach to Problem Decomposition</skill>
<definition>Breaking down a complex problem into manageable parts and addressing them systematically, often by identifying subproblems that need to be solved in sequence.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>123</end>
<text>(2a) Let $S_{i}, 1 \leq i \leq n$, denote the 1-dimensional modules such that $E_{i i}$ acts by 1 and $E_{i j}, E_{j j}$ acts by 0 for $j \neq i$. They are simple modules.</text>
<explanation>The solver begins by constructing specific examples of simple modules, demonstrating a strategic approach to the problem. Rather than immediately trying to characterize all simple modules, they first identify concrete examples, which provides a foundation for the complete solution. This shows strategic problem decomposition by breaking the problem into two steps: first constructing examples, then proving these are the only ones.</explanation>

<start>123</start>
<end>207</end>
<text>(2b) It remains to show that the $S_{i}$ we have constructed are the only simple modules.</text>
<explanation>This explicit statement shows the solver is aware of the structure of their solution and is following a strategic plan. They've completed the first part (constructing examples) and now identify the second part (proving completeness). This demonstrates clear problem decomposition and awareness of the logical structure needed for a complete solution.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Structure Analysis</skill>
<definition>Identifying and leveraging the properties of algebraic structures (like ideals, modules, homomorphisms) to derive conclusions about their behavior or classification.</definition>

<start>207</start>
<end>370</end>
<text>Let $S$ denote any finite dimensional simple module. We claim that $E_{i j}, i<j$, form a nilpotent 2-sided ideal $N$ (because the product of an upper triangular matrix with a strictly upper one is strictly upper).</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies a key algebraic structure (a nilpotent 2-sided ideal) within the algebra of upper triangular matrices. This demonstrates deep understanding of algebraic structures and their properties, specifically recognizing that the strictly upper triangular matrices form an ideal with the nilpotent property, which will be crucial for the subsequent argument.</explanation>

<start>370</start>
<end>520</end>
<text>Then $N$ acts on $S$ by 0 (To see this, $N S$ is a submodule of $S$. It is proper because $N$ is nilpotent. Since $S$ is simple, we deduce that $N S=0$.)</text>
<explanation>The solver applies knowledge about how ideals interact with simple modules, specifically using the fact that a nilpotent ideal must act as zero on a simple module. This shows sophisticated analysis of algebraic structures and their interactions, connecting the properties of the ideal to constraints on possible simple modules.</explanation>

<skill>Theorem Application</skill>
<definition>Recognizing when established mathematical theorems or lemmas are relevant to a problem and correctly applying them to advance the solution.</definition>

<start>520</start>
<end>598</end>
<text>Note that the action of $E_{i i}$ commute with each other (and with the 0 -action by $E_{i j}$ ), thus they are module endomorphisms. By Schur's Lemma, $E_{i i}$ acts on $S$ as a scalar.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies that Schur's Lemma is applicable in this context after establishing that the diagonal elements are module endomorphisms. This demonstrates the ability to recognize when a powerful theorem can be applied and to verify the conditions for its application. The application of Schur's Lemma provides a crucial constraint on the possible actions of diagonal elements.</explanation>

<skill>Logical Deduction</skill>
<definition>Drawing valid conclusions from given premises through a step-by-step reasoning process, often using if-then reasoning and logical implications.</definition>

<start>598</start>
<end>693</end>
<text>Since $E_{i i} E_{j j}=0$ for $i \neq j$, at most one $E_{i i}$ acts as a non-zero scalar.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses logical deduction to derive a key constraint on simple modules. From the algebraic fact that $E_{i i} E_{j j}=0$ for $i \neq j$ and the previous result that each $E_{i i}$ acts as a scalar, they deduce that at most one diagonal element can act non-trivially. This shows the ability to chain logical implications to reach new conclusions.</explanation>

<start>693</start>
<end>762</end>
<text>Recall that $1=\sum_{i} E_{i i}$ acts by the identity. The claim follows.</text>
<explanation>In this final step, the solver completes the logical argument by noting that the sum of all diagonal elements equals the identity, which must act as the identity operator. Combined with the previous deduction that at most one diagonal element acts non-trivially, this completes the proof that the previously constructed modules are indeed the only simple modules. This demonstrates the ability to synthesize multiple logical steps into a coherent conclusion.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Representation</skill>
<definition>Translating abstract mathematical concepts into appropriate symbolic notation or concrete examples to facilitate understanding and manipulation.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>123</end>
<text>(2a) Let $S_{i}, 1 \leq i \leq n$, denote the 1-dimensional modules such that $E_{i i}$ acts by 1 and $E_{i j}, E_{j j}$ acts by 0 for $j \neq i$. They are simple modules.</text>
<explanation>The solver creates a concrete representation of simple modules by explicitly defining how the basis elements of the algebra act on them. This representation makes the abstract concept of a module more concrete and manipulable, showing the ability to translate between abstract definitions and specific mathematical representations.</explanation>

<skill>Forward-Backward Reasoning</skill>
<definition>Combining forward reasoning (starting from what is known and deriving consequences) with backward reasoning (starting from what needs to be proved and identifying sufficient conditions).</definition>

<start>123</start>
<end>762</end>
<text>(2b) It remains to show that the $S_{i}$ we have constructed are the only simple modules. Let $S$ denote any finite dimensional simple module. We claim that $E_{i j}, i<j$, form a nilpotent 2-sided ideal $N$ (because the product of an upper triangular matrix with a strictly upper one is strictly upper). Then $N$ acts on $S$ by 0 (To see this, $N S$ is a submodule of $S$. It is proper because $N$ is nilpotent. Since $S$ is simple, we deduce that $N S=0$.) Note that the action of $E_{i i}$ commute with each other (and with the 0 -action by $E_{i j}$ ), thus they are module endomorphisms. By Schur's Lemma, $E_{i i}$ acts on $S$ as a scalar. Since $E_{i i} E_{j j}=0$ for $i \neq j$, at most one $E_{i i}$ acts as a non-zero scalar. Recall that $1=\sum_{i} E_{i i}$ acts by the identity. The claim follows.</text>
<explanation>The solver combines forward reasoning (starting with properties of the algebra and deriving consequences for any simple module) with backward reasoning (working toward the goal of showing that any simple module must be one of the previously constructed examples). This bidirectional approach efficiently narrows the possibilities until the desired conclusion is reached, demonstrating sophisticated mathematical reasoning.</explanation>
