Problem:
A child attaches a small rock of mass $M=0.800 \mathrm{~kg}$ to one end of a uniform elastic string of mass $m=0.100 \mathrm{~kg}$ and natural length $L=0.650 \mathrm{~m}$. He grabs the other end and swings the rock in uniform circular motion around his hand, with angular velocity $\omega=6.30 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$. Assume his hand is stationary, and that the elastic string behaves like a spring with spring constant $k=40.0 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}$. After that, at time $t=0$, a small longitudinal perturbation starts from the child's hand, traveling towards the rock. At time $t=T_{0}$, the perturbation reaches the rock. How far was the perturbation from the child's hand at time $t=\frac{T_{0}}{2}$ ? Ignore gravity.

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Let $x$ be the distance from a point on the unstretched elastic string to the center of rotation (child's hand). Note that $x$ varies from 0 to $L$. However, the string stretches, so let $r$ be the distance from a point on the stretched string (in steady state) to the center of rotation. Let $T$ be the tension in the string as a function of position. Let $\lambda=\frac{m}{L}$. Consider a portion of the string $d x$. We know that the portion as spring constant $k \frac{L}{d x}$ and it is stretched by $d r-d x$, so by Hooke's Law, we have $T=k \frac{L}{d x}(d r-d x)=k L\left(\frac{d r}{d x}-1\right)$. Also, by applying Newton's Second Law on the portion, we get $d T=-\lambda d x \cdot \omega^{2} r$, which implies $\frac{d T}{d x}=-\lambda \omega^{2} r$. Combining the two equations, we obtain
$$
T=-k L\left(\frac{1}{\lambda \omega^{2}} T^{\prime \prime}+1\right)
$$
We know that
$$
T^{\prime}(x=0)=0,
$$
since $r=0$ when $x=0$. The general solution is
$$
T=A \cos \left(\frac{\omega}{L} \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} x\right)-k L
$$
for some constant $A$. Thus, we have
$$
r=-\frac{1}{\lambda \omega^{2}} T^{\prime}=\frac{A}{\omega \sqrt{k m}} \sin \left(\frac{\omega}{L} \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} x\right)
$$
Also, we have that
$$
T(x=L)=M \omega^{2} \int_{0}^{L} r x d x=M \omega^{2} \int_{0}^{L}\left(\frac{T}{k L}+1\right) x .
$$
Plugging in our general solution, we can get $A \cos \left(\omega \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\right)-k L=M \omega^{2} \cdot \frac{A}{k L} \frac{L}{\omega} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \sin \left(\omega \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\right)$. Solving for $A$, we obtain
$$
A=\frac{k L}{\cos \left(\omega \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\right)-\frac{M \omega}{\sqrt{k m}} \sin \left(\omega \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\right)}
$$
We now introduce a claim:



Claim. The speed of a longitudinal wave on a spring with spring constant $k$, length $L$, and mass $m$ is given by $v=L \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$

Proof. Let a spring with spring constant $k$ and mass $m$ be stretched to length $L$. The spring constant of a small portion $d x$ of the spring is $k \frac{L}{d x}$, and the excess tension is $\delta T=k \frac{L}{d x} d s=k L \frac{d s}{d x}$, where $s$ is the displacement from equilibrium. By Newton's second law on the portion, we get $d T=\frac{m}{L} d x \cdot \frac{d^{2} s}{d t^{2}}$, or $\frac{d T}{d x}=\frac{m}{L} \frac{d^{2} s}{d t^{2}}$. Thus, $L^{2} \frac{k}{m} \frac{d^{2} s}{d x^{2}}=\frac{d^{2} s}{d t^{2}}$, which we recognize as the wave equation with speed $v=L \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$ and the time it takes to traverse the spring is $\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$.

Thus, we have
$$
t=\int d t=\int_{0}^{x} \sqrt{\frac{\lambda d x}{k \cdot \frac{L}{d x}}}=\int_{0}^{x} \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{k L}} d x=\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \frac{x}{L}
$$
Since we know $x=L$ when $t=T_{0}$, we have $x=\frac{L}{2}$ when $t=\frac{T_{0}}{2}$. Therefore, our answer is
$$
r=\frac{A}{\omega \sqrt{k m}} \sin \left(\frac{\omega}{L} \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} x\right)=\frac{1}{\omega} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \frac{L \sin \left(\frac{1}{2} \omega \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\right)}{\cos \left(\omega \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\right)-\frac{M \omega}{\sqrt{k m}} \sin \left(\omega \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\right)}=1.903 \mathrm{~m}
