Domain: Differential equations

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for constants $c_1, c_2$ such that the Schwarzian derivative of $f_k(x)$ satisfies a given second order linear differential equation.

The Schwarzian derivative of a function $g(x)$ is defined as $S g = \left(\frac{g''}{g'}-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{g''}{g'}\right)^2\right)$.

We are given $f_{k}(x)=\left(1+x^{2}\right)^{-1-k}$, where $k \geq 1$ is an integer.
Let $y = (Sf_k)(x)$. We need to find $c_1, c_2$ such that $x y^{\prime \prime}+c_{1} y^{\prime}+c_{2} x y=0$.

First, let's compute the derivatives of $f_k(x)$.
$f_k'(x) = (-1-k)(1+x^2)^{-2-k}(2x) = -2(k+1)x(1+x^2)^{-k-2}$
$f_k''(x) = -2(k+1) \left[ (1)(1+x^2)^{-k-2} + x(-k-2)(1+x^2)^{-k-3}(2x) \right]$
$f_k''(x) = -2(k+1) \left[ (1+x^2)^{-k-2} - 2x^2(k+2)(1+x^2)^{-k-3} \right]$
$f_k''(x) = -2(k+1)(1+x^2)^{-k-3} \left[ (1+x^2) - 2x^2(k+2) \right]$
$f_k''(x) = -2(k+1)(1+x^2)^{-k-3} \left[ 1+x^2 - 2kx^2 - 4x^2 \right]$
$f_k''(x) = -2(k+1)(1+x^2)^{-k-3} \left[ 1 - (2k+3)x^2 \right]$

Now, let's compute $\frac{f_k''}{f_k'}$:
$\frac{f_k''(x)}{f_k'(x)} = \frac{-2(k+1)(1+x^2)^{-k-3} (1 - (2k+3)x^2)}{-2(k+1)x(1+x^2)^{-k-2}}$
$\frac{f_k''(x)}{f_k'(x)} = \frac{(1 - (2k+3)x^2)}{x(1+x^2)^{-1}} = \frac{(1 - (2k+3)x^2)(1+x^2)}{x}$
$\frac{f_k''(x)}{f_k'(x)} = \frac{1 + x^2 - (2k+3)x^2 - (2k+3)x^4}{x} = \frac{1 - (2k+2)x^2 - (2k+3)x^4}{x}$
$\frac{f_k''(x)}{f_k'(x)} = \frac{1}{x} - (2k+2)x - (2k+3)x^3$

Now, let's compute the square of this term:
$\left(\frac{f_k''}{f_k'}\right)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{x} - (2k+2)x - (2k+3)x^3 \right)^2$
$\left(\frac{f_k''}{f_k'}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2 + (-(2k+2)x)^2 + (-(2k+3)x^3)^2 + 2 \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)(-(2k+2)x) + 2 \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)(-(2k+3)x^3) + 2 (-(2k+2)x)(-(2k+3)x^3)$
$\left(\frac{f_k''}{f_k'}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{x^2} + (2k+2)^2 x^2 + (2k+3)^2 x^6 - 2(2k+2) - 2(2k+3)x^2 + 2(2k+2)(2k+3)x^4$
$\left(\frac{f_k''}{f_k'}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{x^2} + 4(k+1)^2 x^2 + (2k+3)^2 x^6 - 4(k+1) - 2(2k+3)x^2 + 4(k+1)(2k+3)x^4$
$\left(\frac{f_k''}{f_k'}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{x^2} + (4(k^2+2k+1) - 4k - 6)x^2 + (2k+3)^2 x^6 - 4(k+1) + 4(k+1)(2k+3)x^4$
$\left(\frac{f_k''}{f_k'}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{x^2} + (4k^2+8k+4 - 4k - 6)x^2 + (4k^2+12k+9) x^6 - 4k - 4 + 4(2k^2+3k+2k+3)x^4$
$\left(\frac{f_k''}{f_k'}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{x^2} + (4k^2+4k-2)x^2 + (4k^2+12k+9) x^6 - 4k - 4 + (8k^2+20k+12)x^4$

Now, we can compute the Schwarzian derivative $y = S f_k = \frac{f_k''}{f_k'} - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{f_k''}{f_k'}\right)^2$.
$y = \left( \frac{1}{x} - (2k+2)x - (2k+3)x^3 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{x^2} + (4k^2+4k-2)x^2 + (4k^2+12k+9) x^6 - 4k - 4 + (8k^2+20k+12)x^4 \right)$
$y = \frac{1}{x} - (2k+2)x - (2k+3)x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2} - \frac{1}{2}(4k^2+4k-2)x^2 - \frac{1}{2}(4k^2+12k+9) x^6 + \frac{1}{2}(4k+4) - \frac{1}{2}(8k^2+20k+12)x^4$
$y = \frac{1}{x} - (2k+2)x - (2k+3)x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2} - (2k^2+2k-1)x^2 - (\frac{4k^2+12k+9}{2}) x^6 + (2k+2) - (4k^2+10k+6)x^4$

Rearranging the terms in descending powers of $x$:
$y = -(\frac{4k^2+12k+9}{2}) x^6 - (4k^2+10k+6)x^4 - (2k^2+2k-1)x^2 - (2k+3)x^3 - (2k+2)x + \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{2x^2} + (2k+2)$

This expression for $y$ looks complicated. Let's check if there is a simpler way to approach the problem.

The differential equation given is $x y^{\prime \prime}+c_{1} y^{\prime}+c_{2} x y=0$.

Consider the properties of the Schwarzian derivative. If $w = T(z) = \frac{az+b}{cz+d}$ is a Möbius transformation, then $S(f \circ T) = (T')^2 (Sf) \circ T$.
If $T(x) = \frac{ax+b}{cx+d}$, then $T'(x) = \frac{a(cx+d) - c(ax+b)}{(cx+d)^2} = \frac{ad-bc}{(cx+d)^2}$.

Let $f(x) = (1+x^2)^{-1-k}$.
Consider the case $k=1$, $f_1(x) = (1+x^2)^{-2}$.
$f_1'(x) = -2(1+x^2)^{-3}(2x) = -4x(1+x^2)^{-3}$
$f_1''(x) = -4[(1)(1+x^2)^{-3} + x(-3)(1+x^2)^{-4}(2x)]$
$f_1''(x) = -4(1+x^2)^{-4}[(1+x^2) - 6x^2] = -4(1-5x^2)(1+x^2)^{-4}$
$\frac{f_1''}{f_1'} = \frac{-4(1-5x^2)(1+x^2)^{-4}}{-4x(1+x^2)^{-3}} = \frac{(1-5x^2)}{x(1+x^2)}$
$\frac{f_1''}{f_1'} = \frac{1-5x^2}{x+x^3}$

$\left(\frac{f_1''}{f_1'}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1-5x^2}{x+x^3}\right)^2 = \frac{(1-5x^2)^2}{x^2(1+x^2)^2} = \frac{1 - 10x^2 + 25x^4}{x^2(1+2x^2+x^4)} = \frac{1 - 10x^2 + 25x^4}{x^2+2x^4+x^6}$

$y = S f_1 = \frac{1-5x^2}{x+x^3} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{1 - 10x^2 + 25x^4}{x^2+2x^4+x^6}$
$y = \frac{(1-5x^2)(x^2+2x^4+x^6) - \frac{1}{2}(1 - 10x^2 + 25x^4)(x+x^3)}{(x+x^3)(x^2+2x^4+x^6)}$
$y = \frac{(x^2+2x^4+x^6 - 5x^4-10x^6-5x^8) - \frac{1}{2}(x+x^3 - 10x^3-10x^5 + 25x^5+25x^7)}{x^3(1+x^2)^3}$
$y = \frac{(x^2-3x^4-9x^6-5x^8) - \frac{1}{2}(x-9x^3+15x^5+25x^7)}{x^3(1+x^2)^3}$

This is still complicated. Let's use the property that the Schwarzian derivative is related to the solutions of linear second order differential equations.
If $y_1, y_2$ are two linearly independent solutions of $y'' + p(x) y' + q(x) y = 0$, then $S \left(\frac{y_1}{y_2}\right) = 2 q(x) - p'(x) - \frac{1}{2} p(x)^2$.

Consider the differential equation satisfied by $f_k(x)$.
Let $w = f_k(x) = (1+x^2)^{-1-k}$.
$\frac{dw}{dx} = -2(k+1)x(1+x^2)^{-k-2}$
$\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = -2(k+1)[(1+x^2)^{-k-2} + x(-k-2)(1+x^2)^{-k-3}(2x)]$
$\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = -2(k+1)(1+x^2)^{-k-3}[(1+x^2) - 2x^2(k+2)]$
$\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = -2(k+1)(1 - (2k+3)x^2)(1+x^2)^{-k-3}$

Let $y = (Sf_k)(x)$. We need to solve $x y^{\prime \prime}+c_{1} y^{\prime}+c_{2} x y=0$.

Consider the case when $k=1$, $f_1(x) = (1+x^2)^{-2}$.
Let $w = (1+x^2)^{-2}$.
$w' = -4x(1+x^2)^{-3}$
$w'' = -4(1-5x^2)(1+x^2)^{-4}$

Consider the differential equation whose solutions have a ratio with Schwarzian derivative equal to $y$.
If $y = S(w)$, then $\frac{w''}{w'} = \frac{y'}{\sqrt{|y'|}}$ if $y' \neq 0$.

Let's look at the structure of the differential equation for $y$.
If $y$ is the Schwarzian derivative of some function, does it always satisfy such a differential equation?

Consider the differential equation $u'' + r(x) u = 0$. The ratio of two independent solutions has Schwarzian derivative equal to $2r(x)$.
So, if $y = Sf_k$, then $\frac{y}{2}$ could be the coefficient of $u$ in such a differential equation.

Let $y = S(f_k)$. We are given $x y^{\prime \prime}+c_{1} y^{\prime}+c_{2} x y=0$.

Consider the case when $f_k(x)$ is a Möbius transformation. Then $Sf_k = 0$, so $y=0$.
This implies $0 = 0$, so any $c_1, c_2$ would work. But $f_k(x)$ is not a Möbius transformation.

Let $w = f_k(x)$.
$S(w) = \frac{w'''}{w'} - \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{w''}{w'}\right)^2$.
$S(w) = y$.

We have $y = \frac{f_k''}{f_k'} - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{f_k''}{f_k'}\right)^2$.
Let $u = \frac{f_k''}{f_k'}$. Then $y = u - \frac{1}{2} u^2$.
$y' = u' - uu'$
$y'' = u'' - (u'u' + uu'') = u'' - (u')^2 - uu''$

Substitute into the differential equation:
$x (u'' - (u')^2 - uu'') + c_1 (u' - uu') + c_2 x (u - \frac{1}{2} u^2) = 0$
$x u'' - x (u')^2 - xu u'' + c_1 u' - c_1 uu' + c_2 xu - \frac{1}{2} c_2 xu^2 = 0$

We have $u = \frac{f_k''}{f_k'} = \frac{1}{x} - (2k+2)x - (2k+3)x^3$.
$u' = -\frac{1}{x^2} - (2k+2) - 3(2k+3)x^2$
$u' = -\frac{1}{x^2} - (2k+2) - (6k+9)x^2$

This approach seems tedious due to the complexity of $u$.

Let's use the connection between Schwarzian derivative and linear differential equations.
If $y = Sf$, then $f = w_1 / w_2$, where $w_1, w_2$ are solutions of $w'' + \frac{1}{2} y w = 0$.

Here, $y = Sf_k$. So $f_k = \frac{w_1}{w_2}$, where $w_1, w_2$ are solutions of $w'' + \frac{1}{2} (Sf_k) w = 0$.
$w'' + \frac{1}{2} y w = 0$.

We have $f_k(x) = (1+x^2)^{-1-k}$.
Consider the differential equation satisfied by $f_k$.

Let $f = (1+x^2)^\alpha$.
$f' = \alpha (1+x^2)^{\alpha-1} (2x)$
$f'' = \alpha [2(1+x^2)^{\alpha-1} + 2x(\alpha-1)(1+x^2)^{\alpha-2}(2x)]$
$f'' = 2\alpha (1+x^2)^{\alpha-2} [(1+x^2) + 2x^2(\alpha-1)]$
$f'' = 2\alpha (1+x^2)^{\alpha-2} [1+x^2 + 2\alpha x^2 - 2x^2]$
$f'' = 2\alpha (1 + (2\alpha-1)x^2) (1+x^2)^{\alpha-2}$

If $\alpha = -1-k$, then $\alpha-2 = -3-k$.
$f_k'' = 2(-1-k) (1 + (2(-1-k)-1)x^2) (1+x^2)^{-3-k}$
$f_k'' = -2(k+1) (1 + (-2-2k-1)x^2) (1+x^2)^{-3-k}$
$f_k'' = -2(k+1) (1 - (2k+3)x^2) (1+x^2)^{-3-k}$, which matches our previous calculation.

We have $w'' + \frac{1}{2} y w = 0$.
Let the differential equation for which $f_k$ is the ratio of solutions be $v'' + P(x) v' + Q(x) v = 0$.
Then $Sf_k = 2Q - P' - \frac{1}{2} P^2$.

Consider the differential equation satisfied by $(1+x^2)^{\alpha}$.
$\frac{f''}{f} = \frac{2\alpha (1 + (2\alpha-1)x^2)}{(1+x^2)^2}$

Consider the linear differential equation whose ratio of solutions is $f_k(x)$.
This is related to the Schwarzian equation.

Let $y = Sf_k$. The differential equation is $x y^{\prime \prime}+c_{1} y^{\prime}+c_{2} x y=0$.

If $y = S(w)$, and $w = u_1 / u_2$, where $u_1, u_2$ are solutions of $u'' + r(x) u = 0$, then $y = 2r(x)$.
Here, $r(x) = \frac{1}{2} Sf_k$.

We need to find the form of $Sf_k$.
Consider the symmetry of $f_k(x)$. $f_k(-x) = f_k(x)$, so $f_k$ is an even function.
$f_k'(x)$ is odd, $f_k''(x)$ is even.
$\frac{f_k''}{f_k'}$ is odd, $\left(\frac{f_k''}{f_k'}\right)^2$ is even.
$Sf_k = \text{odd} - \frac{1}{2} \text{even}$, so $Sf_k$ is odd.
$y(x)$ is an odd function.

If $y(x)$ is odd, then $y'(x)$ is even, $y''(x)$ is odd.
The differential equation is $x y^{\prime \prime}+c_{1} y^{\prime}+c_{2} x y=0$.
$x \times \text{odd} + c_1 \times \text{even} + c_2 x \times \text{odd} = 0$
odd + $c_1$ even + odd = 0.

If $c_1 = 0$, then odd + odd = 0.
This implies $x y'' + c_2 x y = 0$, so $y'' + c_2 y = 0$.
If $y$ is odd, $y''$ is odd. Odd + $c_2$ Odd = 0, which is true.

If $c_1 = 0$, the equation is $x y'' + c_2 x y = 0$, or $y'' + c_2 y = 0$.
If $y = Sf_k$, is $y''$ proportional to $y$?

Consider the form of $Sf_k$.
$S f_k = \frac{1}{x} - (2k+2)x - (2k+3)x^3 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{x^2} + (4k^2+4k-2)x^2 + \dots \right)$

Let's reconsider the structure of the problem.
We are given the function $f_k(x) = (1+x^2)^{-1-k}$.
Let $y = Sf_k$. We need to find $c_1, c_2$ such that $x y^{\prime \prime}+c_{1} y^{\prime}+c_{2} x y=0$.

Consider the case $k=1$. $f_1(x) = (1+x^2)^{-2}$.
$S f_1 = \frac{1-5x^2}{x(1+x^2)} - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1-5x^2}{x(1+x^2)} \right)^2$
$S f_1 = \frac{1-5x^2}{x(1+x^2)} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{1-5x^2}{x(1+x^2)} \right)$
$S f_1 = \frac{1-5x^2}{x(1+x^2)} \left( \frac{x(1+x^2) - \frac{1}{2}(1-5x^2)}{x(1+x^2)} \right)$
$S f_1 = \frac{(1-5x^2)(x+x^3 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{5}{2}x^2)}{x^2(1+x^2)^2}$
$S f_1 = \frac{(1-5x^2)(x+\frac{5}{2}x^2+x^3 - \frac{1}{2})}{x^2(1+x^2)^2}$

Let's try to find the differential equation for $S((1+x^2)^\alpha)$.

<text>Let's use the connection between Schwarzian derivative and linear differential equations.
If $y = Sf$, then $f = w_1 / w_2$, where $w_1, w_2$ are solutions of $w'' + \frac{1}{2} y w = 0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies a key relationship between Schwarzian derivatives and linear differential equations, showing their ability to connect different mathematical structures.

<text>If $c_1 = 0$, then odd + odd = 0.
This implies $x y'' + c_2 x y = 0$, so $y'' + c_2 y = 0$.
If $y$ is odd, $y''$ is odd. Odd + $c_2$ Odd = 0, which is true.</text>
<explanation>The solver evaluates the implications of setting $c_1 = 0$ and checks whether this is consistent with the symmetry properties they've identified. This demonstrates monitoring of their solution process by verifying that their proposed value of $c_1$ is compatible with the mathematical constraints they've established.</explanation>

<text>Now, let's compute $\frac{f_k''}{f_k'}$:
$\frac{f_k''(x)}{f_k'(x)} = \frac{-2(k+1)(1+x^2)^{-k-3} (1 - (2k+3)x^2)}{-2(k+1)x(1+x^2)^{-k-2}}$
$\frac{f_k''(x)}{f_k'(x)} = \frac{(1 - (2k+3)x^2)}{x(1+x^2)^{-1}} = \frac{(1 - (2k+3)x^2)(1+x^2)}{x}$</text>
<explanation>The solver carefully computes the ratio of derivatives, simplifying as they go and checking that the expressions remain equivalent. They recognize common factors that can be canceled and track the powers of $(1+x^2)$ to ensure correct simplification. This demonstrates ongoing monitoring of their algebraic manipulations.</explanation>
