Problem:
Let  $f:[-\pi/2,\pi/2]\to\mathbb{R}$  be a twice differentiable function which satisfies \[\left(f''(x)-f(x)\right)\cdot\tan(x)+2f'(x)\geqslant 1,\]for all  $x\in(-\pi/2,\pi/2)$ . Prove that \[\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}f(x)\cdot \sin(x) \ dx\geqslant \pi-2.\]

Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. Given the inequality:
   \[
   \left(f''(x) - f(x)\right) \cdot \tan(x) + 2f'(x) \geq 1,
   \]
   for all \( x \in (-\pi/2, \pi/2) \).

2. Multiply both sides of the inequality by \(\cos(x)\), which is non-negative in the interval \([-\pi/2, \pi/2]\):
   \[
   \left(f''(x) - f(x)\right) \cdot \sin(x) + 2f'(x) \cos(x) \geq \cos(x).
   \]

3. Notice that the left-hand side can be rewritten using the product rule:
   \[
   \left(f(x) \sin(x) + \cos(x)\right)'' \geq 0.
   \]
   This implies that the function \( g(x) = f(x) \sin(x) + \cos(x) \) is convex on the interval \((- \pi/2, \pi/2)\).

4. Since \( g(x) \) is convex, we have:
   \[
   g(x_1) + g(x_2) \geq 2g\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\right).
   \]

5. Consider the integral:
   \[
   \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x) \sin(x) \, dx.
   \]

6. Using the definition of \( g(x) \), we can rewrite the integral:
   \[
   \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x) \sin(x) \, dx = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \left(g(x) - \cos(x)\right) \, dx.
   \]

7. Split the integral:
   \[
   \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \left(g(x) - \cos(x)\right) \, dx = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} g(x) \, dx - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) \, dx.
   \]

8. Evaluate the integral of \(\cos(x)\):
   \[
   \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) \, dx = 2.
   \]

9. Since \( g(x) \) is convex, we use the property of convex functions:
   \[
   \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} g(x) \, dx = 2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} g(x) \, dx.
   \]

10. By symmetry and convexity:
    \[
    \int_{0}^{\pi/2} g(x) \, dx \geq \int_{0}^{\pi/2} g(0) \, dx = \int_{0}^{\pi/2} 1 \, dx = \frac{\pi}{2}.
    \]

11. Therefore:
    \[
    \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} g(x) \, dx \geq \pi.
    \]

12. Combining the results:
    \[
    \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x) \sin(x) \, dx \geq \pi - 2.
    \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\pi - 2}\).
