<definition>The ability to mentally represent, manipulate, and reason about geometric objects and their spatial relationships in three dimensions.</definition>

<explanation>Though the solution is minimalist (just showing "11"), the problem requires visualizing a regular octahedron and a cube in three-dimensional space, understanding their spatial relationship, and conceptualizing how the vertices of the cube correspond to the centers of the faces of the octahedron. This visualization is essential for solving the problem, even if the details of this visualization aren't shown in the brief solution.</explanation>

<skill>Spatial Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to understand and reason about the properties and relationships of objects in space, including their positions, dimensions, and transformations.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>11</end>
<text>11</text>
<explanation>The solution requires understanding the spatial relationship between the octahedron and the cube, specifically how the cube is constructed from the centers of the octahedron's faces. This involves spatial reasoning to determine how these geometric solids relate to each other in three-dimensional space.</explanation>

<skill>Volume Ratio Calculation</skill>
<definition>The ability to determine and compare the volumes of three-dimensional geometric shapes, particularly finding the ratio between volumes of related shapes.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>11</end>
<text>11</text>
<explanation>The problem explicitly asks for the ratio of volumes between the octahedron and cube. The solution "11" indicates that the solver has calculated this ratio to be m/n where m+n=11 (likely 4/7 or 7/4), which requires understanding volume formulas for these polyhedra and determining their relative sizes.</explanation>

<skill>Coordinate Geometry Application</skill>
<definition>The ability to use coordinate systems to represent geometric objects and apply algebraic methods to solve geometric problems.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>11</end>
<text>11</text>
<explanation>Though not explicitly shown, solving this problem likely involved placing the octahedron in a coordinate system (probably with its center at the origin) to determine the coordinates of its face centers (which become the cube's vertices) and then calculate the respective volumes.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Simplification</skill>
<definition>The ability to reduce complex mathematical expressions to their simplest form, including finding fractions in lowest terms.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>11</end>
<text>11</text>
<explanation>The problem requires expressing the volume ratio as a fraction m/n in lowest terms (where m and n are relatively prime). The answer "11" indicates that the solver found this ratio and determined that m+n=11, which requires simplifying the fraction to its lowest terms.</explanation>

<skill>Polyhedra Property Knowledge</skill>
<definition>Understanding the properties of three-dimensional geometric solids, including their structure, symmetry, and mathematical relationships.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>11</end>
<text>11</text>
<explanation>The solution demonstrates knowledge of the properties of regular octahedra and cubes, including understanding how to relate the faces of one to the vertices of another, and knowing the formulas needed to calculate their volumes.</explanation>
