Domain: Combinatorics

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
A compound containing elements A and B hydrolyzes with the formation of a flammable gas; this gas or its salts can be used in the qualitative analysis of certain inorganic metal ions. Since the AxBy compound undergoes hydrolysis, it can be either a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, or a salt of a strong base and a weak acid.
Compound AxBy belongs to solid substances that can scratch quartz. According to the Mohs hardness scale, it can be, for example, corundum (Al2O3) or silicon carbide (SiC). «A simple substance of one of the elements can react with water after the removal of the oxide film from its surface» - additional clue pointing to aluminum.
Elements B and C form a gaseous substance BxCy, which is soluble in water and has acidic properties (causing litmus paper to turn red in the solution). CO2 gas is not suitable in this case because it does not match the initial conditions of the task, while SO2 is suitable.
Thus, element A – aluminium, B – sulfur and C – oxygen. Substance AB is aluminum oxide Al2O3 (corundum), gas BC – sulfur (IV) dioxide SO2
The reactions involved in this task:
2Al + 3S = Al2S3
Al2S3 + 6H2O = 2Al(OH)3 + 3H2S (flammable gas, salts - Na2S, (NH4)2S)
4Al + 3O2 = 2Al2O3
Substance X – Al2(SO4)3
The 1st stage of Al2(SO4)3 hydrolysis is described by the following reaction:
Al2(SO4)3 + 2H2O = 2AlOHSO4 + H2SO4
Sum of the coefficients = 6
