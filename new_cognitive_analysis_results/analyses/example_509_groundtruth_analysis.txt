# Analysis of Cognitive Skills

<skill>Mathematical Knowledge Retrieval</skill>
<definition>The ability to recall relevant mathematical formulas, theorems, or properties needed to solve a problem.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>21</end>
<text>21</text>
<explanation>This solution demonstrates the solver's ability to retrieve and apply multiple mathematical formulas including the volume formula for a square pyramid (V = 1/3 × base area × height), properties of spheres, and the Pythagorean theorem. While the working steps aren't shown, the correct answer of 21 indicates the solver successfully recalled and applied these formulas to find that m+n = 21.</explanation>

<skill>Spatial Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to visualize and manipulate three-dimensional objects mentally, understanding spatial relationships between objects or parts of objects.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>21</end>
<text>21</text>
<explanation>To solve this problem, the solver needed to visualize a right square pyramid with its five vertices (four at the base corners and one at the apex) and understand how these vertices relate to a sphere. This requires strong spatial reasoning to conceptualize the three-dimensional configuration and determine the radius of the sphere that passes through all vertices.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Problem Decomposition</skill>
<definition>The ability to break down a complex problem into simpler, more manageable sub-problems that can be solved individually.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>21</end>
<text>21</text>
<explanation>The solver likely decomposed this problem into steps: (1) finding the height of the pyramid using the volume formula, (2) determining the coordinates of all five vertices, (3) calculating the distance from each vertex to the center of the sphere, and (4) expressing this radius as a fraction in lowest terms. The correct answer indicates successful problem decomposition.</explanation>

<skill>Coordinate Geometry Application</skill>
<definition>The ability to apply coordinate systems to geometric problems, representing points, lines, and shapes using coordinates to enable algebraic approaches.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>21</end>
<text>21</text>
<explanation>To determine the radius of the sphere, the solver likely placed the pyramid in a coordinate system (probably with the base centered at the origin) and calculated the coordinates of each vertex. This allowed them to find the center of the sphere and calculate the radius as a distance in this coordinate system.</explanation>

<skill>Number Theory Understanding</skill>
<definition>The ability to work with properties of integers, including concepts like relatively prime numbers, greatest common divisors, and fraction reduction.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>21</end>
<text>21</text>
<explanation>The problem requires expressing the radius as a fraction m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. The solver needed to reduce the fraction to its lowest terms by finding and dividing by the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator, ultimately determining that m+n = 21.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to manipulate algebraic expressions, equations, and formulas to isolate variables or transform expressions into more useful forms.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>21</end>
<text>21</text>
<explanation>Though not explicitly shown, the solver would have needed to manipulate algebraic expressions to find the height of the pyramid from the volume formula, calculate the coordinates of the vertices, determine the center of the sphere, and express the radius in the required form. The correct answer indicates proficiency in these algebraic manipulations.</explanation>
