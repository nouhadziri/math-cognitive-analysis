Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem. Let me first read through it again and then try to break it down step by step.

The problem states: A mixture of ideal gases consisting of 5 moles of a monatomic gas and 1 mole of a rigid diatomic gas is initially at pressure P0, volume V0, and temperature T0. The gas mixture is adiabatically compressed to a volume V0/4. We need to determine which of the given statements (A) through (D) are correct. The provided information includes approximations for 2^1.2 = 2.3 and 2^3.2 = 9.2, and R is the gas constant.

The options are:

(A) The work |W| done during the process is 13 RT0

(B) The average kinetic energy of the gas mixture after compression is between 18 RT0 and 19 RT0

(C) The final pressure of the gas mixture after compression is between 9 P0 and 10 P0

(D) The adiabatic constant (γ) of the gas mixture is 1.6

So, let's begin by tackling each part step by step. 

First, I need to handle the mixture of gases. Since it's an ideal gas mixture, the total number of moles is 5 + 1 = 6 moles. But when considering such a mixture, the adiabatic process depends on the degrees of freedom contributed by each type of gas, right? So, to find the adiabatic index (γ) for the mixture, we need to compute the effective degrees of freedom.

But how exactly do we do that? Let me recall. For an ideal gas, the molar specific heat at constant volume (Cv) is (degrees of freedom/2) * R. For a monatomic gas, the degrees of freedom (DOF) are 3 (translational only), so Cv = (3/2) R. For a rigid diatomic gas, at room temperature, the DOF is 5 (3 translational, 2 rotational), so Cv = (5/2) R. If this is a "rigid" diatomic, then vibrational modes aren't considered, right? So, yes, 5/2 R for Cv.

But then, when we have a mixture, the total Cv for the mixture is the mole-fraction weighted average of the Cv's of each component. Similarly for Cp, but for an adiabatic process, we need γ = Cp/Cv. Wait, but γ is Cp/Cv. So perhaps I can compute the total Cv for the mixture and then Cp.

Let's write down Cv_total and Cp_total.

So, total Cv is (n1*Cv1 + n2*Cv2) / (n1 + n2). Similarly, total Cp is (n1*Cp1 + n2*Cp2) / (n1 + n2). But since Cp = Cv + R for each species.

Wait, for an ideal gas, Cp = Cv + R. So actually, maybe instead of computing Cp_total separately, it's better to compute γ_total as ( (n1*Cp1 + n2*Cp2) / (n1 + n2) ) / ( (n1*Cv1 + n2*Cv2) / (n1 + n2) ) ), which simplifies to (n1*Cp1 + n2*Cp2) / (n1*Cv1 + n2*Cv2)

Alternatively, since γ is Cp/Cv, but for the mixture, perhaps γ_mix = [ (n1*(Cv1 + R) + n2*(Cv2 + R) ) ] / (n1*Cv1 + n2*Cv2 )

But since for each gas, Cp = Cv + R, so the numerator would be [n1*Cv1 + n1*R + n2*Cv2 + n2*R] = (n1*Cv1 + n2*Cv2) + R(n1 + n2). Then denominator is (n1*Cv1 + n2*Cv2). So γ_mix = [ (Total Cv) + R(n_total) ] / Total Cv = 1 + R(n_total)/Total Cv

Hmm, but let's see. So, for each individual component, γ1 = (Cv1 + R)/Cv1 = 1 + R/Cv1

But for a mixture, I don't think that the γ can be computed by averaging the γ's of the individual components. Instead, the correct way is to first compute the total Cv and Cp, then compute γ as (Cp_total/Cv_total).

So let's proceed step by step.

First, compute the total Cv and Cp.

For monatomic gas (n1=5 moles):

Cv1 = (3/2) R

Cp1 = Cv1 + R = (5/2) R

For diatomic gas (n2=1 mole):

Cv2 = (5/2) R

Cp2 = Cv2 + R = (7/2) R

Total Cv_total = (n1 Cv1 + n2 Cv2) / (n1 +n2) ?

Wait, but no, when you have the mixture, the internal energy U is U1 + U2 = n1 Cv1 T + n2 Cv2 T = (n1 Cv1 + n2 Cv2) T. So the total internal energy is equal to that.

But when we are talking about Cv for the mixture per mole, then it is [n1 Cv1 + n2 Cv2]/(n_total). So specific heat per mole (assuming T is same for both components). So yeah, Cv_mix = (5*(3/2 R) + 1*(5/2 R)) / (5 + 1) = ?

Let me compute this.

Cv_mix = [5*(3/2 R) + 1*(5/2 R)] / 6 = [ (15/2 + 5/2) R ] / 6 = (20/2 R)/6 = 10 R / 6 = 5 R /3 ≈ 1.6667 R

Similarly, Cp_mix would be [5*(5/2 R) +1*(7/2 R)] /6 = [ (25/2 +7/2 ) R ] /6 = 32 /2 R /6 = 16 R /6 = 8 R /3 ≈ 2.6667 R

Then, γ = Cp_mix / Cv_mix = (8 R /3 ) / (5 R /3 ) ) = 8/5 = 1.6. So that's 1.6

Wait, so then option D says the adiabatic constant of the gas mixture is 1.6, which we just calculated. So that would be correct. So maybe answer D is correct.

But let's check the other options as well. Let's verify first.

Alternately, maybe my approach is wrong? Because in the case of a gas mixture, there's another way to compute the adiabatic index, but perhaps this way is correct. Alternatively, people sometimes use:

1/(γ_mix -1) = Σ (n_i/(γ_i -1)) / Σ n_i

Hmm, let me recall. Is there a formula like that?

Yes, in some cases, when internal energy is being considered. For example, for the mixture, since U = n1 Cv1 T + n2 Cv2 T = (n1 Cv1 + n2 Cv2) T. The total internal energy is (Cv_total) * n_total * T, where Cv_total per mole is [n1 Cv1 + n2 Cv2]/n_total. So in that sense, γ is [ (n1 (Cv1 + R) + n2 (Cv2 + R)) / (n1 Cv1 + n2 Cv2) ]

So indeed:

Gamma_mix = [n1 Cp1 + n2 Cp2]/(n1 Cv1 + n2 Cv2)

Which is:

Cp1 = Cv1 + R, so gamma_mix = [5*(5/2 R) +1*(7/2 R)] / [5*(3/2 R)+1*(5/2 R)] = same as before.

Calculating numerator:

5*(5/2 R) = 25/2 R

1*(7/2 R) = 7/2 R

Total numerator: 32/2 R = 16 R

Denominator:5*(3/2 R) = 15/2 R, 1*(5/2 R)=5/2 R, total:20/2 R =10 R

Therefore, gamma_mix = 16 R / 10 R = 16/10=1.6, which is what I got. So yes, option D is correct. So that's a key point.

Therefore, statement D is correct.

Now, let's check the other options. So first, statement C says the final pressure is between 9P0 and 10P0. If the process is adiabatic, then for an adiabatic process of an ideal gas, we have PV^γ = constant. Since the initial state is P0, V0, and the final volume is V0/4. Then, the final pressure P1 = P0 * (V0 / V1)^γ = P0*(4)^gamma.

Since gamma is 1.6, then P1 = P0 *4^1.6.

Hmm, 4^1.6. Wait, 4 is 2^2, so 4^1.6 = (2^2)^1.6=2^(3.2). So that's 2^3.2. As per given, 2^3.2=9.2. Therefore, P1=9.2 P0, which is between 9 and 10. So statement C is correct. Hmm so 9.2 is given, so between 9 and 10. So answer C is correct.

Then, statement (C) is correct.

Thus, we can check option C: yes, correct.

Moving on to statement (A): the work done is |W|=13RT0. So the work done during adiabatic compression. In an adiabatic process, the work done is equal to the change in internal energy. So W=ΔU. Since it's compressed, work is done on the gas, so the internal energy increases. But since they denote |W|, then if the work done on the gas is positive, then |W|=ΔU. So for an adiabatic process, W = (P1V1 - P0V0)/(γ -1)

Alternatively, ΔU = n_total Cv_mix (T1 - T0). So since ΔU = W.

Let me recall the formula for work done in adiabatic process. Alternatively, maybe better to calculate the temperature change.

In an adiabatic process, for an ideal gas, TV^(γ-1)=constant or T V^{γ-1} = constant.

Thus, initial temperature is T0, volume V0. Final volume is V0/4. So,

T1 = T0 × (V0 / V1)^{γ -1} = T0 × (4)^{gamma -1}

gamma is 1.6, so gamma -1 =0.6

Therefore, T1 = T0 ×4^0.6= T0 ×(2^2)^0.6=2^{1.2}=2.3

Given that 2^{1.2}=2.3 from the problem statement. Therefore, T1=2.3 T0

Alternatively, T1= T0*(V0 / V1)^{γ -1} = T0*(4)^{0.6}= T0 * 4^{0.6}

But 4^{0.6}= e^{0.6 ln4}= e^{0.6 *1.386}= e^{0.8316}≈2.297. Which is approximately 2.3. So yes, T1 ≈2.3 T0

But maybe it is exact? Well, the problem gives 2^{1.2}=2.3. Since 4^{0.6}=2^{1.2}=2.3. Therefore, T1=2.3 T0.

Now, since the internal energy change is ΔU= n_total Cv_mix (T1 - T0). Since we computed Cv_mix earlier as 5/3 R per mole. Total moles n_total=6.

Thus, ΔU=6*(5/3 R)*(2.3 T0 - T0)=6*(5/3 R)*(1.3 T0)=6*(5/3 *1.3 R T0)=simplify:

First, 6/3=2, so 2*5*1.3=10*1.3=13.

Thus, ΔU=13 R T0.

But since the process is compression, work is done on the gas, so the work done on the gas is positive, hence the work done by the gas is negative. The problem states |W|=13 RT0. But according to the first law, since ΔU=Q + W, but Q=0, ΔU=W here. However, the sign convention can be a bit tricky. In physics, work done *by* the gas is considered negative when the gas is compressed. So in this case, since the gas is being compressed, work is done *on* the gas, so W_positive in the first law (ΔU=W). Hence, the work done by the gas would be -13 RT0, so the absolute value |W|=13 RT0. So statement (A) is correct.

Therefore, option A is correct.

Now, statement B: the average kinetic energy of the gas mixture after compression is between 18 RT0 and 19 RT0.

Average kinetic energy for an ideal gas is (number of moles) * (degrees of freedom)/2 * R T. Wait, isn't the average kinetic energy per mole for translational is (3/2) RT? But actually, in thermodynamics, the total average kinetic energy is (f/2) R T per mole, where f is the degrees of freedom. However, wait, monatomic gases have 3 degrees of freedom, diatomic have 5 (translational + rotational). But rigid diatomic, so maybe 5. So each mole of monatomic gas has KE=(3/2) RT, diatomic has (5/2) RT. But in the problem statement, they say "average kinetic energy of the gas mixture", so that would be the sum of individual kinetic energies. After compression, the temperature is T1 =2.3 T0 (from earlier). Therefore, let's compute the total kinetic energy.

Total kinetic energy is sum over all moles:

For monatomic gas: n1=5 moles, each with KE=(3/2) R T1

Diatomic: n2=1 mole, each with KE=(5/2) R T1

So total KE=5*(3/2 R T1) +1*(5/2 R T1)= (15/2 +5/2 ) R T1=20/2 R T1=10 R T1=10 R*(2.3 T0)=23 R T0.

Therefore, the total kinetic energy is 23 R T0. So between 18 and 19 RT0? No, 23 RT0 would be outside that range. So perhaps the problem statement is referring to per mole kinetic energy? But the question says "average kinetic energy of the gas mixture". The term "average kinetic energy" in the context of gases can be ambiguous. But if they are referring to per mole kinetic energy, then the total KE is divided by number of moles. Total moles is 6.

So total KE is 23 R T0, average per mole is 23/6 R T0≈3.83 R T0. But that seems not likely, as the statement is that "average kinetic energy of the gas mixture after compression" is between 18 and 19 R T0.

But 23 RT0 is well above 19 RT0, so perhaps the the answer is not there. But let's re-examine.

Wait, KE for a monatomic gas is (3/2) k_b T per molecule, but when considering moles, is it (3/2) R T per mole. Similarly diatomic. But the problem says "average kinetic energy of the gas mixture", which if taken as the total, it is 23 R T0, but if taken as per molecule average, or per mole. The problem's wording is unclear.

However, looking at the answer choices (given in options), it states "average kinetic energy...is in between 18 RT0 and 19 RT0". If "average" is per mole, then 23 RT0 /6≈3.83 RT0, but per mole is not between 18 and 19. Alternatively, maybe per volume or not? Alternatively, maybe question refers to "average kinetic energy per molecule times Avogadro's number", but unlikely. Wait, perhaps mistake in my calculations. Let's recheck.

Wait, wait, if the kinetic energy is given per mole? For monatomic, it's (3/2) RT per mole. For diatomic, it's (5/2) RT per mole. Since temperature T1=2.3 T0.

So 5 moles of monatomic gas have 5 * (3/2) R T1

1 mole of diatomic: 1 * (5/2) R T1

So total KE= (15/2 +5/2 ) R T1=20/2 R T1=10 R T1

Which is 10 R *2.3 T0=23 R T0. So total KE is 23 RT0. Therefore, average KE per mole is 23 RT0 /6≈3.83 RT0. However, none of the options indicate that.

But the correct question says "the average kinetic energy of the gas mixture after compression". If "average" here is a misnomer, perhaps they meant total kinetic energy? If it said total, then 23 RT0 is the answer, which is not between 18 and19. If not, the statement is incorrect.

Alternatively, but wait, average KE could refer to something else. Wait in the kinetic theory, the average kinetic energy per molecule is (3/2) k_b T for a monatomic gas. For diatomic gas, that's also (3/2)k_b T for translational, and rotational is another (2/2)k_b T. But if rigid diatomic, then I guess rotational energy is added. But when they talk about "average kinetic energy", maybe only translational is considered? Wait, but the question doesn't specify. If only translational, then the total kinetic energy is:

For monatomic:5*(3/2 R T1)

For diatomic:1*(3/2 R T1)

Total: (15/2 +3/2 ) R T1=18/2 R T1=9 R T1=9 R*2.3 T0=20.7 R T0 So 20.7 RT0 is between 18 and 19? No, it's above 20.7. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe a mistake in thinking. Wait, let me confirm the concept.

In thermodynamics, when discussing the average kinetic energy of gas particles, it's usually referring to the translational kinetic energy, as that's related to temperature. For ideal gases, the average translational kinetic energy per molecule is (3/2) k_b T regardless of the type of molecule. So even diatomic molecules have the same average translational KE as monatomic. However, if considering all forms (rotational, etc.), then the total energy is higher. So, when the problem mentions "average kinetic energy", do they mean translational only, or total?

The problem does state "average kinetic energy of the gas mixture". If they are asking only translational KE, which is (3/2) k_b T per molecule, then the total KE (translational) would be for all molecules:

Total molecules N= (5+1) Avogadro =6N_A.

Total translational KE= (6 N_A)* (3/2 k_b T1) =6*(3/2 R T1 )=9 R T1=9 R *2.3 T0=20.7 R T0. So 20.7 RT0. But 20.7 is between 20 and 21 RT0, so not between 18 and19 RT0.

Alternatively, this "average kinetic energy" refers to per mole? For translational KE per mole: (3/2) R T. So then total translational KE per mole is 3/2 R *2.3 T0=3.45 RT0 per mole, but average over the mixture is same since all moles same temperature. If it’s not that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just calculating the sum of (number of moles) times (Cv times temperature). So since after adiabatic compression, the temperature is 2.3 T0, then U= n_total Cv_mix T1. Earlier, we had U=13 RT0. Wait, earlier, ΔU=13 RT0, but initial U is ?

Wait, perhaps need to check initial internal energy and then final internal energy. Let's recast:

Initial internal energy U0= n1 Cv1 T0 +n2 Cv2 T0=5*(3/2 R) T0 +1*(5/2 R) T0=(15/2+5/2) RT0=10 RT0. Then final internal energy U1=U0 +ΔU=10 RT0 +13 RT0=23 RT0.

So the KE here refers to the total internal energy? But in the problem, it says "average kinetic energy". Typically, the internal energy includes all forms: translational, rotational, etc. So, if the problem is using internal energy synonymously as average kinetic energy (which is not accurate but possible in some contexts), then the final internal energy is 23 RT0, but that isn't between 18 and19. So the sum of energy would indeed suggest that, which is higher. Alternatively, if they use translational kinetic energy, which is 9 RT1 =20.7 RT0. It's between 20 and21 RT0. Hence, even option B's given range is way below.

Hence, probably, the answer would have to say whether B is correct. But unless my approach is wrong. Wait.

Wait, maybe the value of T1 is not 2.3 * T0 but different? Wait, we computed gamma=1.6, then for the process PV^gamma=const.

Wait, but also in terms of temperature and volume:

T V^{γ-1}=const. So T1= T0*(V0/V1)^{γ-1}=T0*(4)^{0.6}=2.3 T0, correct?

Yes, using 4^{0.6}= (2^2)^0.6=2^{1.2}=2.3. Hence, T1=2.3*T0. So all the calculations are correct. Therefore, U1=23 RT0. KE is 23 RT0 as internal energy. But answer B says between 18 and19. Hence, maybe statement B is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps misread the problem? Let me check again.

Original problem: (Given 2^{1.2}=2.3 ; 2^{3.2}=9.2; ...)

Wait in the compression, is it from V0 to V0/4? That is right, so the volume is decreased by factor 4, so V1=V0/4. So the V0/V1 ratio is 4. So (V0/V1)^{gamma}=4^{1.6}= as used in pressure. Yes, 4^1.6= 2^{3.2}=9.2.

I think the calculations are solid. Therefore, total internal energy (kinetic energy of the molecules including all forms) is 23 RT0. So 23 falls outside 18 to19. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.

So options A, C, D are correct? But let me check.

First, we can list:

(A) Work |W| done is13RT0: correct, sinceΔU=13 RT0.

(B) average KE between 18 and19: incorrect.

(C) Final pressure between 9P0 and 10 P0: indeed 9.2 P0: correct.

(D) Adiabatic constant is1.6: correct.

Hence, correct answers are A, C, D.

Wait, but according to the calculations, options A, C, D are correct? But original problem labels (A) to (D). Wait, but need to check the exact answer statement—sometimes multiple answers have to be selected.

But here the user lists options (A) through (D). However, first, the user's calculations need confirmation.

Wait, in doing the work W. Let me check: Since it's an adiabatic process, Q=0, so ΔU= -W, where W is work done by the system. So ΔU is positive (since T increased), so ΔU=23 RT0 - initial U0=10 RT0, ΔU=13 RT0. But as W in first law is work done by the gas, in physics typically ΔU = -W (compression work done on the gas). Therefore, if the work done by the gas is negative, and the work done on the gas is 13RT0. So the absolute work |W|=13RT0, which the problem mentions. So the answer is correct.

Thus, in statements, answers A, C, D are correct. But the options (A, C, D) are each correct. So according to the problem's options, they might have multiple correct. The problem is an Indian competitive exam problem (JEE Advanced probably), so options (C) yes, (D) yes, (A) yes; (B) no. So likely the correct answers are A, C, D. But according to statement B? As per the calculations, no. Therefore, answer choices (A, C, D).

Therefore, the user should select options A, C, D.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{A}, \boxed{C}, \boxed{D}

<text>Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem. Let me first read through it again and then try to break it down step by step.

Wait, so then option D says the adiabatic constant of the gas mixture is 1.6, which we just calculated. So that would be correct. So maybe answer D is correct.

But let's check the other options as well.</text>
<explanation>After calculating the adiabatic constant, the solver identifies that option D matches their result but continues to systematically check the other options rather than stopping after finding one correct answer.</explanation>

<start>9634</start>
<end>9827</end>
<text>So options A, C, D are correct? But let me check.

First, we can list:

(A) Work |W| done is13RT0: correct, sinceΔU=13 RT0.

(B) average KE between 18 and19: incorrect.

(C) Final pressure between 9P0 and 10 P0: indeed 9.2 P0: correct.

(D) Adiabatic constant is1.6: correct.</text>
<explanation>The solver summarizes their findings for each option in a systematic manner, showing how they've methodically worked through each part of the problem and reached conclusions for each option.</explanation>

<start>2324</start>
<end>2440</end>
<text>Let's verify first.

Alternately, maybe my approach is wrong? Because in the case of a gas mixture, there's another way to compute the adiabatic index</text>
<explanation>The solver questions their own approach and considers alternative methods for calculating the adiabatic index, showing self-awareness and a willingness to verify their work.</explanation>

<start>2804</start>
<end>3218</end>
<text>Gamma_mix = [n1 Cp1 + n2 Cp2]/(n1 Cv1 + n2 Cv2)

Which is:

Cp1 = Cv1 + R, so gamma_mix = [5*(5/2 R) +1*(7/2 R)] / [5*(3/2 R)+1*(5/2 R)] = same as before.

Calculating numerator:

5*(5/2 R) = 25/2 R

1*(7/2 R) = 7/2 R

Total numerator: 32/2 R = 16 R

Denominator:5*(3/2 R) = 15/2 R, 1*(5/2 R)=5/2 R, total:20/2 R =10 R

Therefore, gamma_mix = 16 R / 10 R = 16/10=1.6, which is what I got.</text>
<explanation>The solver recalculates the adiabatic constant using a slightly different approach to verify their previous result, demonstrating careful error checking and confirmation of their work.</explanation>

<start>5665</start>
<end>5889</end>
<text>Given that 2^{1.2}=2.3 from the problem statement. Therefore, T1=2.3 T0

Alternatively, T1= T0*(V0 / V1)^{γ -1} = T0*(4)^{0.6}= T0 * 4^{0.6}

But 4^{0.6}= e^{0.6 ln4}= e^{0.6 *1.386}= e^{0.8316}≈2.297. Which is approximately 2.3.</text>
<explanation>The solver calculates the temperature ratio using two different methods (using the given value and calculating it directly) to verify their result, showing careful error checking and validation of their calculations.</explanation>

<start>7031</start>
<end>7333</end>
<text>But the problem does state "average kinetic energy of the gas mixture". If they are asking only translational KE, which is (3/2) k_b T per molecule, then the total KE (translational) would be for all molecules:

Total molecules N= (5+1) Avogadro =6N_A.

Total translational KE= (6 N_A)* (3/2 k_b T1) =6*(3/2 R T1 )=9 R T1=9 R *2.3 T0=20.7 R T0. So 20.7 RT0. But 20.7 is between 20 and 21 RT0, so not between 18 and19 RT0.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates metacognitive awareness by recognizing a potential ambiguity in the problem statement regarding "average kinetic energy" and considering different interpretations of what this might mean in the context of the problem.</explanation>

<start>7334</start>
<end>7551</end>
<text>Alternatively, this "average kinetic energy" refers to per mole? For translational KE per mole: (3/2) R T. So then total translational KE per mole is 3/2 R *2.3 T0=3.45 RT0 per mole, but average over the mixture is same since all moles same temperature. If it's not that.</text>
<explanation>The solver continues to explore different interpretations of "average kinetic energy," showing metacognitive awareness of the potential ambiguity in the problem statement and considering multiple possible meanings.</explanation>

<start>8188</start>
<end>8469</end>
<text>Wait, maybe the value of T1 is not 2.3 * T0 but different? Wait, we computed gamma=1.6, then for the process PV^gamma=const.

Wait, but also in terms of temperature and volume:

T V^{γ-1}=const. So T1= T0*(V0/V1)^{γ-1}=T0*(4)^{0.6}=2.3 T0, correct?

Yes, using 4^{0.6}= (2^2)^0.6=2^{1.2}=2.3. Hence, T1=2.3*T0.</text>
<explanation>The solver questions their calculation of the final temperature and then verifies it by reconsidering the fundamental relationships, showing metacognitive awareness by recognizing potential errors and verifying their understanding.</explanation>

<text>But since the process is compression, work is done on the gas, so the work done on the gas is positive, hence the work done by the gas is negative. The problem states |W|=13 RT0. But according to the first law, since ΔU=Q + W, but Q=0, ΔU=W here. However, the sign convention can be a bit tricky. In physics, work done *by* the gas is considered negative when the gas is compressed. So in this case, since the gas is being compressed, work is done *on* the gas, so W_positive in the first law (ΔU=W).</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates physical intuition by carefully considering the sign convention for work in thermodynamics and relating it to the physical process of compression, showing an understanding of how the abstract concept of work relates to the concrete physical situation.</explanation>

<start>9828</start>
<end>10201</end>
<text>Wait, in doing the work W. Let me check: Since it's an adiabatic process, Q=0, so ΔU= -W, where W is work done by the system. So ΔU is positive (since T increased), so ΔU=23 RT0 - initial U0=10 RT0, ΔU=13 RT0. But as W in first law is work done by the gas, in physics typically ΔU = -W (compression work done on the gas). Therefore, if the work done by the gas is negative, and the work done on the gas is 13RT0. So the absolute work |W|=13RT0, which the problem mentions.</text>
<explanation>The solver again demonstrates physical intuition by carefully reasoning through the relationship between internal energy change and work in an adiabatic process, showing an understanding of the physical meaning of these quantities and how they relate to the compression process.</explanation>
