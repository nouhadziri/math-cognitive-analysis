Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
To prove that \( K \) is metrizable, we will proceed in two main steps. First, we will show that \( K \) can be embedded into a metrizable space, and then we will use properties of compactness and Hausdorff spaces to conclude that \( K \) itself is metrizable.

1. **Reduction to Closed Sets:**
   Since \( K = \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty} A_n \) and each \( A_n \) is metrizable, we can assume without loss of generality that \( A_n \) are closed. This is because any compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed, and we can replace \( A_n \) with their closures in \( K \).

2. **Defining Metrics:**
   Let \( d_n \) be the metric on \( A_n \). We can assume \( d_n(x, y) \leq 1 \) for all \( x, y \in A_n \) by scaling the metrics if necessary. Define a new metric \( \overline{d_n} \) on \( A_n \) as follows:
   \[
   \overline{d_n}(x, y) = \sum_{m \ge n} 2^{n-m} d_m(x, y) \quad \forall x, y \in A_n.
   \]
   This ensures that \( \overline{d_n} \ge \frac{1}{2} \overline{d_{n+1}} \).

3. **Extending Metrics:**
   Fix \( n \). To show that \( \overline{A_n} \) is metrizable, we need to extend the metric \( d_m \) over \( A_m \) for \( m \geq n \) to a metric over \( \overline{A_n} \). Define the set of "bad" points \( B_{n,m} \) as:
   \[
   B_{n,m} = \left\{ x \in \overline{A_n} \mid \exists \varepsilon > 0, \forall U \in \tau(K), x \in U, \exists u_1, u_2 \in U \cap A_m, d_m(u_1, u_2) > \varepsilon \right\}.
   \]
   We need to show that \( B_{n,m} \) is empty for sufficiently large \( m \).

4. **Properties of \( B_{n,m} \):**
   - \( B_{n,m} \subset \overline{A_n} \setminus A_m \).
   - \( B_{n,m} \) is closed.
   - \( B_{n,m_2} \subset B_{n,m_1} \) for \( m_2 > m_1 \).

   To prove that \( B_{n,m} \) is closed, let \( b \) be a limit point of \( B_{n,m} \). For any neighborhood \( U \) of \( b \), there exists \( b_1 \in B_{n,m} \) with \( b_1 \in U \). Since \( K \) is compact and Hausdorff, it is regular, so we can separate \( b_1 \) from \( K \setminus U \). Thus, \( b \in B_{n,m} \).

5. **Vanishing of "Bad" Points:**
   Since \( B_{n,n} \supset B_{n,n+1} \supset \ldots \) and \( B_{n,m} \) are compact with \( \bigcap_{m} B_{n,m} = \emptyset \), it follows that \( B_{n,m} = \emptyset \) for all sufficiently large \( m \). Therefore, we can extend the metric \( d_m \) over \( \overline{A_n} \).

6. **Embedding into a Cube:**
   Since each \( A_n \) is a compact metric space, it is separable. Let \( a^{(n)}_i \in A_n \) be a dense set in \( A_n \). Define functions \( f^{(n)}_i : A_n \to [0,1] \) by \( f^{(n)}_i(x) = d_n(x, a^{(n)}_i) \). Using the Tietze extension theorem, extend \( f^{(n)}_i \) to continuous maps \( f^{(n)}_i : K \to [0,1] \).

7. **Constructing the Embedding:**
   Define the map \( \phi : K \to [0,1]^F \) by \( \phi(x) = \langle f(x) \rangle_{f \in F} \). Check that:
   - \( \phi \) is continuous.
   - \( \phi \) is injective.
   - \( \phi \) is an open mapping in \( \phi(K) \) with the induced topology.

   Therefore, \( \phi \) is a homeomorphism between \( K \) and \( \phi(K) \). Since \( [0,1]^F \) is metrizable, \( K \) is metrizable.
