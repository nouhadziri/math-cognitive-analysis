Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the range of $a$ such that there exist two common tangent lines (other than the x-axis) to the curve $y = \frac{8}{27}x^3$ and the parabola $y = (x+a)^2$. Then, for this range of $a$, we need to find the area bounded by these two common tangent lines and the parabola.

Part 1: Finding the range of $a$.

Let the tangent to the curve $y = \frac{8}{27}x^3$ at the point $(t, \frac{8}{27}t^3)$ be $y - \frac{8}{27}t^3 = \frac{8}{9}t^2(x-t)$.
So, $y = \frac{8}{9}t^2 x - \frac{8}{9}t^3 + \frac{8}{27}t^3 = \frac{8}{9}t^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t^3$.

Let the tangent to the parabola $y = (x+a)^2$ at the point $(s-a, s^2)$ be $y - s^2 = 2(s-a+a)(x - (s-a)) = 2s(x - s + a)$.
So, $y = 2sx - 2s^2 + 2sa + s^2 = 2sx - s^2 + 2sa$.

For a common tangent, the slope and y-intercept must be equal.
$\frac{8}{9}t^2 = 2s \implies s = \frac{4}{9}t^2$
$-\frac{16}{27}t^3 = -s^2 + 2sa$

Substitute $s = \frac{4}{9}t^2$ into the second equation:
$-\frac{16}{27}t^3 = -(\frac{4}{9}t^2)^2 + 2(\frac{4}{9}t^2)a$
$-\frac{16}{27}t^3 = -\frac{16}{81}t^4 + \frac{8}{9}at^2$

We are looking for common tangents other than the x-axis. The x-axis corresponds to $t=0$, which gives $s=0$.
Assume $t \neq 0$. Divide by $t^2$:
$-\frac{16}{27}t = -\frac{16}{81}t^2 + \frac{8}{9}a$
Multiply by 81 to clear denominators:
$-48t = -16t^2 + 72a$
$16t^2 - 48t - 72a = 0$
Divide by 8:
$2t^2 - 6t - 9a = 0$

For two distinct common tangents, there must be two distinct non-zero values of $t$ satisfying this quadratic equation.
The discriminant of the quadratic equation in $t$ must be positive:
$\Delta = (-6)^2 - 4(2)(-9a) = 36 + 72a > 0 \implies 72a > -36 \implies a > -\frac{1}{2}$.

Also, the roots of the quadratic equation must be non-zero. If $t=0$ is a root, then $-9a = 0$, so $a=0$.
Thus, we need $a \neq 0$.

Let the two distinct non-zero roots be $t_1, t_2$. These correspond to two distinct common tangents.

The slopes of the common tangents are $m = \frac{8}{9}t^2$. Since $t_1 \neq t_2$, but $t_1^2$ can be equal to $t_2^2$, the slopes might be the same.
Consider the values of $s$ corresponding to $t_1, t_2$: $s_1 = \frac{4}{9}t_1^2$, $s_2 = \frac{4}{9}t_2^2$.
If $t_1^2 = t_2^2$, then $s_1 = s_2$, meaning the point of tangency on the parabola is the same, which implies the tangents are the same.

We need two distinct common tangent lines. This means the slopes must be different, so $t_1^2 \neq t_2^2$.
From the quadratic equation $2t^2 - 6t - 9a = 0$, the roots are $t = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 72a}}{4} = \frac{6 \pm 6\sqrt{1+2a}}{4} = \frac{3 \pm 3\sqrt{1+2a}}{2}$.

For two distinct real roots, $1+2a > 0 \implies a > -\frac{1}{2}$.
The roots are non-zero if $a \neq 0$.

Let $t_1 = \frac{3 + 3\sqrt{1+2a}}{2}$ and $t_2 = \frac{3 - 3\sqrt{1+2a}}{2}$.
We need $t_1^2 \neq t_2^2$, which means $|t_1| \neq |t_2|$, unless $t_1 = -t_2$.
If $t_1 = -t_2$, then $\frac{3 + 3\sqrt{1+2a}}{2} = -\frac{3 - 3\sqrt{1+2a}}{2}$,
$3 + 3\sqrt{1+2a} = -3 + 3\sqrt{1+2a}$, so $3 = -3$, impossible.

So we need $t_1^2 \neq t_2^2$.
$t_1^2 - t_2^2 = (t_1 - t_2)(t_1 + t_2) \neq 0$.
$t_1 - t_2 = \frac{3 + 3\sqrt{1+2a}}{2} - \frac{3 - 3\sqrt{1+2a}}{2} = 3\sqrt{1+2a}$. Since $a > -\frac{1}{2}$, $1+2a > 0$, so $t_1 - t_2 \neq 0$.
$t_1 + t_2 = \frac{3 + 3\sqrt{1+2a}}{2} + \frac{3 - 3\sqrt{1+2a}}{2} = 3$.

So, $t_1^2 - t_2^2 = 3 \cdot 3\sqrt{1+2a} = 9\sqrt{1+2a}$.
Since $a > -\frac{1}{2}$, $1+2a > 0$, so $t_1^2 - t_2^2 \neq 0$.

The condition for two distinct common tangents (other than the x-axis) is $a > -\frac{1}{2}$ and $a \neq 0$.

Let's check the case when the common tangent is the x-axis.
The tangent to $y = \frac{8}{27}x^3$ is $y = 0$ when $t=0$.
The tangent to $y = (x+a)^2$ is $y = 0$ when $s=0$.
If $t=0$, then $2(0)^2 - 6(0) - 9a = 0 \implies -9a = 0 \implies a=0$.
When $a=0$, the x-axis is a common tangent.

Range of $a$ is $a > -\frac{1}{2}$ and $a \neq 0$.

Part 2: Area bounded by the two tangent lines and the parabola.

Let the two common tangents be $L_1$ and $L_2$.
The equations of the tangents are $y = m_1 x + c_1$ and $y = m_2 x + c_2$.
$m = \frac{8}{9}t^2$, $c = -\frac{16}{27}t^3$.
Tangent 1: $y = \frac{8}{9}t_1^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t_1^3$
Tangent 2: $y = \frac{8}{9}t_2^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t_2^3$

The parabola is $y = (x+a)^2$.
The area is given by $\int_{x_1}^{x_2} ((x+a)^2 - (m_1 x + c_1)) dx$ + $\int_{x_2}^{x_3} ((x+a)^2 - (m_2 x + c_2)) dx$, where $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are the intersection points.

Alternatively, consider the integral with respect to $y$.

Intersection of the two tangents:
$\frac{8}{9}t_1^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t_1^3 = \frac{8}{9}t_2^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t_2^3$
$\frac{8}{9}(t_1^2 - t_2^2)x = \frac{16}{27}(t_1^3 - t_2^3)$
$x = \frac{\frac{16}{27}(t_1 - t_2)(t_1^2 + t_1 t_2 + t_2^2)}{\frac{8}{9}(t_1 - t_2)(t_1 + t_2)} = \frac{2}{3} \frac{t_1^2 + t_1 t_2 + t_2^2}{t_1 + t_2}$
$t_1 + t_2 = 3$
$t_1 t_2 = -\frac{9a}{2}$
$t_1^2 + t_2^2 = (t_1 + t_2)^2 - 2t_1 t_2 = 9 - 2(-\frac{9a}{2}) = 9 + 9a$

$x = \frac{2}{3} \frac{9 + 9a - \frac{9a}{2}}{3} = \frac{2}{9} (9 + \frac{9a}{2}) = 2 + a$.
The x-coordinate of the intersection of the two tangents is $2+a$.

Intersection of tangent 1 with the parabola:
$\frac{8}{9}t_1^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t_1^3 = (x+a)^2$
$\frac{8}{9}t_1^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t_1^3 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$
$x^2 + (2a - \frac{8}{9}t_1^2)x + a^2 + \frac{16}{27}t_1^3 = 0$
Since the line is tangent to the parabola, this quadratic equation must have a repeated root.
Discriminant = 0: $(2a - \frac{8}{9}t_1^2)^2 - 4(1)(a^2 + \frac{16}{27}t_1^3) = 0$
$4a^2 - \frac{32}{9}at_1^2 + \frac{64}{81}t_1^4 - 4a^2 - \frac{64}{27}t_1^3 = 0$
$-\frac{32}{9}at_1^2 + \frac{64}{81}t_1^4 - \frac{64}{27}t_1^3 = 0$
Divide by $\frac{32}{27}t_1^2$:
$-3a + \frac{2}{3}t_1^2 - 2t_1 = 0$
$2t_1^2 - 6t_1 - 9a = 0$. This is consistent with the condition we found earlier.

The x-coordinate of the point of tangency of tangent 1 with the parabola.
The repeated root is $x = -\frac{B}{2A} = -\frac{2a - \frac{8}{9}t_1^2}{2} = -a + \frac{4}{9}t_1^2$.
So, $x_1 = \frac{4}{9}t_1^2 - a$.
Similarly, the x-coordinate of the point of tangency of tangent 2 with the parabola is $x_2 = \frac{4}{9}t_2^2 - a$.

The area bounded by the two tangents and the parabola can be found by integrating the difference between the parabola and the tangent lines.
Area = $\int_{x_1}^{x_{intersection}} ((x+a)^2 - (\frac{8}{9}t_1^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t_1^3)) dx + \int_{x_{intersection}}^{x_2} ((x+a)^2 - (\frac{8}{9}t_2^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t_2^3)) dx$

Let the parabola be $P(x) = (x+a)^2$, tangent 1 be $T_1(x)$, tangent 2 be $T_2(x)$.
Area = $\int_{x_1}^{2+a} (P(x) - T_1(x)) dx + \int_{2+a}^{x_2} (P(x) - T_2(x)) dx$.

Consider the area between the parabola and one tangent line, e.g., tangent 1.
The points of intersection are where $(x+a)^2 = \frac{8}{9}t_1^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t_1^3$.
We know that the tangent touches the parabola at $x = \frac{4}{9}t_1^2 - a$.

Consider the general case of a parabola $y = k(x-\alpha)^2 + \beta$ and a tangent line $y = m(x-x_0) + y_0$ at $(x_0, y_0)$.
The area between the parabola and the tangent is given by $\frac{2}{3} |x_1 - x_0|^3 |k|$, where $x_1$ is the other intersection point.
However, the tangent here intersects at only one point.

Let's use the formula for the area between a curve and its tangent.
If a tangent to $y=f(x)$ at $x=c$ is $y = f'(c)(x-c) + f(c)$, the area between the curve and the tangent is $\int_a^c (f(x) - (f'(c)(x-c) + f(c))) dx$, where $a$ is the other intersection.

Consider the area between $y=(x+a)^2$ and the tangent $y = \frac{8}{9}t^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t^3$.
The point of tangency is $x = \frac{4}{9}t^2 - a$.
Let $\xi = x+a$, so the parabola is $y = \xi^2$.
Tangent: $y = \frac{8}{9}t^2 (\xi - a) - \frac{16}{27}t^3 = \frac{8}{9}t^2 \xi - \frac{8}{9}at^2 - \frac{16}{27}t^3$.

Area between $y=\xi^2$ and $y = m\xi + b$.
Intersection points when $\xi^2 = m\xi + b$.
Tangent at $\xi_0$: $m = 2\xi_0$, $b = -\xi_0^2$.
Tangent equation: $y = 2\xi_0 \xi - \xi_0^2$.
Area = $\int_{\xi_0}^{\xi_1} (\xi^2 - (2\xi_0 \xi - \xi_0^2)) d\xi$, where $\xi_1$ is the other intersection.

Let's use a coordinate transformation.
Shift the origin such that the vertex of the parabola is at the origin.
$X = x+a$, $Y = y$.
Parabola: $Y = X^2$.
Tangent 1: $y = \frac{8}{9}t_1^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t_1^3$
$Y = \frac{8}{9}t_1^2 (X-a) - \frac{16}{27}t_1^3 = \frac{8}{9}t_1^2 X - \frac{8}{9}at_1^2 - \frac{16}{27}t_1^3$.

Consider the area between $Y = X^2$ and the tangent $Y = mX + c$.
The tangent to $Y = X^2$ at $X_0$ is $Y = 2X_0 X - X_0^2$.
Equating the coefficients: $m = 2X_0$, $c = -X_0^2$.

Comparing with the common tangent equation:
$\frac{8}{9}t^2 = m = 2X_0 \implies X_0 = \frac{4}{9}t^2$.
$-\frac{8}{9}at^2 - \frac{16}{27}t^3 = c = -X_0^2 = -(\frac{4}{9}t^2)^2 = -\frac{16}{81}t^4$.
Multiply by 81: $-72at^2 - 48t^3 = -16t^4$.
Divide by $16t^2$: $-4.5a - 3t = -t^2 \implies t^2 - 3t - 4.5a = 0$.
$2t^2 - 6t - 9a = 0$. Consistent.

The points of tangency on the parabola $Y=X^2$ are $X_1 = \frac{4}{9}t_1^2$ and $X_2 = \frac{4}{9}t_2^2$.
The two tangents are $Y = 2X_1 X - X_1^2$ and $Y = 2X_2 X - X_2^2$.
Intersection of tangents: $2X_1 X - X_1^2 = 2X_2 X - X_2^2$
$2(X_1 - X_2) X = X_1^2 - X_2^2 = (X_1 - X_2)(X_1 + X_2)$
$X = \frac{X_1 + X_2}{2} = \frac{1}{2} (\frac{4}{9}t_1^2 + \frac{4}{9}t_2^2) = \frac{2}{9}(t_1^2 + t_2^2) = \frac{2}{9}(9+9a) = 2(1+a)$.

The area bounded by the parabola $Y=X^2$ and the two tangents.
Consider the area between the parabola and one tangent, e.g., $Y = 2X_1 X - X_1^2$.
Intersection point is $X_1$.
The area is $\int_{X_{vertex}}^{X_1} (X^2 - (2X_1 X - X_1^2)) dX = \int_{0}^{X_1} (X^2 - 2X_1 X + X_1^2) dX = \int_{0}^{X_1} (X - X_1)^2 dX$
$= [\frac{(X-X_1)^3}{3}]_0^{X_1} = 0 - \frac{(-X_1)^3}{3} = \frac{X_1^3}{3}$.

Similarly, the area between the parabola and the second tangent is $\frac{|X_2|^3}{3}$.

The area bounded by the two tangents and the parabola.
Consider the intersection point of the tangents $X = 2(1+a)$.
Assume $X_1 < X_2$.
Area = $\int_{X_1}^{2(1+a)} (X^2 - (2X_1 X - X_1^2)) dX + \int_{2(1+a)}^{X_2} (X^2 - (2X_2 X - X_2^2)) dX$
$= [\frac{(X-X_1)^3}{3}]_{X_1}^{2(1+a)} + [\frac{(X-X_2)^3}{3}]_{2(1+a)}^{X_2}$
$= \frac{(2(1+a) - X_1)^3}{3} - 0 + 0 - \frac{(2(1+a) - X_2)^3}{3}$
$= \frac{1}{3} ((2(1+a) - X_1)^3 - (2(1+a) - X_2)^3)$
$= \frac{1}{3} ((\frac{4}{9}(t_1^2 + t_2^2) - \frac{4}{9}t_1^2)^3 - (\frac{4}{9}(t_1^2 + t_2^2) - \frac{4}{9}t_2^2)^3)$
$= \frac{1}{3} ((\frac{4}{9}t_2^2)^3 - (\frac{4}{9}t_1^2)^3) = \frac{64}{2187} (t_2^6 - t_1^6)$.

Assume $t_1 < t_2$.
Area = $\frac{1}{3} ((X_{intersection} - X_1)^3 + (X_2 - X_{intersection})^3)$
$= \frac{1}{3} ((2(1+a) - \frac{4}{9}t_1^2)^3 + (\frac{4}{9}t_2^2 - 2(1+a))^3)$.

Alternative method: Area = $\int_{X_1}^{X_2} |X^2 - L(X)| dX$, where $L(X)$ is the lower envelope of the two tangents.
The intersection point is $X = 2(1+a)$.
Area = $\int_{X_1}^{2(1+a)} (X^2 - (2X_1 X - X_1^2)) dX + \int_{2(1+a)}^{X_2} (X^2 - (2X_2 X - X_2^2)) dX$.

Let's check the range of $a$.
We need two distinct common tangents other than the x-axis.
$a > -\frac{1}{2}$, $a \neq 0$.

Final check of the area formula.
Area = $\frac{1}{3} |X_2 - X_1|^3 = \frac{1}{3} |\frac{4}{9}(t_2^2 - t_1^2)|^3 = \frac{64}{2187} |t_2^2 - t_1^2|^3$.
$t_2^2 - t_1^2 = -9\sqrt{1+2a}$.
Area = $\frac{64}{2187} |-9\sqrt{1+2a}|^3 = \frac{64}{2187} \cdot 729 (1+2a)^{3/2} = \frac{64}{3} (1+2a)^{3/2}$.

$X = x+a$, $Y = y$.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies a coordinate transformation to simplify the problem, shifting the x-axis so that the parabola is in standard form with its vertex at the origin, which makes the subsequent calculations more straightforward.</explanation>

<text>Parabola: $Y = X^2$.
Tangent 1: $y = \frac{8}{9}t_1^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t_1^3$
$Y = \frac{8}{9}t_1^2 (X-a) - \frac{16}{27}t_1^3 = \frac{8}{9}t_1^2 X - \frac{8}{9}at_1^2 - \frac{16}{27}t_1^3$.</text>

<text>Let the tangent to the curve $y = \frac{8}{27}x^3$ at the point $(t, \frac{8}{27}t^3)$ be $y - \frac{8}{27}t^3 = \frac{8}{9}t^2(x-t)$.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies differential calculus to find the tangent line to the cubic curve, using the fact that the derivative of y = (8/27)x³ is (8/9)x², evaluated at x = t.</explanation>

<text>Let the two common tangents be $L_1$ and $L_2$.
The equations of the tangents are $y = m_1 x + c_1$ and $y = m_2 x + c_2$.
$m = \frac{8}{9}t^2$, $c = -\frac{16}{27}t^3$.
Tangent 1: $y = \frac{8}{9}t_1^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t_1^3$
Tangent 2: $y = \frac{8}{9}t_2^2 x - \frac{16}{27}t_2^3$</text>

<end>3625</end>
<text>The parabola is $y = (x+a)^2$.
The area is given by $\int_{x_1}^{x_2} ((x+a)^2 - (m_1 x + c_1)) dx$ + $\int_{x_2}^{x_3} ((x+a)^2 - (m_2 x + c_2)) dx$, where $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are the intersection points.</text>

<definition>The ability to interpret algebraic results in terms of geometric properties and relationships, translating between algebraic and geometric representations.</definition>

<start>1345</start>
<end>1437</end>
<text>Also, the roots of the quadratic equation must be non-zero. If $t=0$ is a root, then $-9a = 0$, so $a=0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver interprets the condition t=0 geometrically, recognizing that this corresponds to the x-axis being a common tangent, which is excluded by the problem statement.</explanation>

<start>1438</start>
<end>1539</end>
<text>Thus, we need $a \neq 0$.

Let the two distinct non-zero roots be $t_1, t_2$. These correspond to two distinct common tangents.</text>
<explanation>The solver connects the algebraic condition a≠0 to the geometric requirement of having common tangents other than the x-axis, showing the ability to interpret algebraic conditions geometrically.</explanation>

<start>1540</start>
<end>1774</end>
<text>The slopes of the common tangents are $m = \frac{8}{9}t^2$. Since $t_1 \neq t_2$, but $t_1^2$ can be equal to $t_2^2$, the slopes might be the same.
Consider the values of $s$ corresponding to $t_1, t_2$: $s_1 = \frac{4}{9}t_1^2$, $s_2 = \frac{4}{9}t_2^2$.
If $t_1^2 = t_2^2$, then $s_1 = s_2$, meaning the point of tangency on the parabola is the same, which implies the tangents are the same.</text>
<explanation>The solver interprets the algebraic relationship between t₁ and t₂ in terms of the geometric property of having distinct tangent lines, showing the ability to translate between algebraic and geometric representations.</explanation>

<text>Let's check the case when the common tangent is the x-axis.
The tangent to $y = \frac{8}{27}x^3$ is $y = 0$ when $t=0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies the special case of the x-axis as a common tangent, demonstrating the practice of checking boundary or special cases to ensure the completeness of the solution.</explanation>

<start>2942</start>
<end>3106</end>
<text>The tangent to $y = (x+a)^2$ is $y = 0$ when $s=0$.
If $t=0$, then $2(0)^2 - 6(0) - 9a = 0 \implies -9a = 0 \implies a=0$.
When $a=0$, the x-axis is a common tangent.
