Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Partition the domain**: We start by partitioning the domain \([0, \infty)\) into two intervals \([0, R)\) and \([R, \infty)\) for some \(R > 0\).

2. **Apply Hölder's inequality**: For the interval \([0, R)\), we use Hölder's inequality. Recall that Hölder's inequality states that for measurable functions \(u\) and \(v\) and conjugate exponents \(p\) and \(q\) (i.e., \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\)):
   \[
   \int_0^R |u(x)v(x)| \, dx \leq \left( \int_0^R |u(x)|^p \, dx \right)^{1/p} \left( \int_0^R |v(x)|^q \, dx \right)^{1/q}
   \]
   We choose \(u(x) = 1\) and \(v(x) = f(x)\), with \(p = 2\) and \(q = 2\). Thus,
   \[
   \int_0^R f(x) \, dx \leq \left( \int_0^R 1 \, dx \right)^{1/2} \left( \int_0^R f(x)^2 \, dx \right)^{1/2}
   \]
   Simplifying the integrals, we get:
   \[
   \int_0^R f(x) \, dx \leq R^{1/2} \left( \int_0^R f(x)^2 \, dx \right)^{1/2}
   \]

3. **Estimate the integral over \([R, \infty)\)**: For the interval \([R, \infty)\), we use the fact that \(x \geq R\) and thus \(f(x) \leq \frac{xf(x)}{R}\). Therefore,
   \[
   \int_R^\infty f(x) \, dx \leq \frac{1}{R} \int_R^\infty x f(x) \, dx
   \]
   Since \(\int_R^\infty x f(x) \, dx \leq \int_0^\infty x f(x) \, dx\), we have:
   \[
   \int_R^\infty f(x) \, dx \leq \frac{1}{R} \int_0^\infty x f(x) \, dx
   \]

4. **Combine the estimates**: Adding the two parts together, we get:
   \[
   \int_0^\infty f(x) \, dx = \int_0^R f(x) \, dx + \int_R^\infty f(x) \, dx
   \]
   Using the estimates from steps 2 and 3, we have:
   \[
   \int_0^\infty f(x) \, dx \leq R^{1/2} \left( \int_0^\infty f(x)^2 \, dx \right)^{1/2} + \frac{1}{R} \int_0^\infty x f(x) \, dx
   \]

5. **Optimize the choice of \(R\)**: To minimize the right-hand side, we choose:
   \[
   R = \left( \frac{\int_0^\infty x f(x) \, dx}{\int_0^\infty f(x)^2 \, dx} \right)^{1/3}
   \]
   Substituting this value of \(R\) into the inequality, we get:
   \[
   \int_0^\infty f(x) \, dx \leq \left( \left( \frac{\int_0^\infty x f(x) \, dx}{\int_0^\infty f(x)^2 \, dx} \right)^{1/6} \left( \int_0^\infty f(x)^2 \, dx \right)^{1/2} + \left( \frac{\int_0^\infty f(x)^2 \, dx}{\int_0^\infty x f(x) \, dx} \right)^{1/3} \int_0^\infty x f(x) \, dx \right)
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \int_0^\infty f(x) \, dx \leq 2 \left( \int_0^\infty f(x)^2 \, dx \right)^{1/3} \left( \int_0^\infty x f(x) \, dx \right)^{1/3}
   \]

6. **Cube both sides**: Finally, we cube both sides to obtain the desired inequality:
   \[
   \left( \int_0^\infty f(x) \, dx \right)^3 \leq 8 \left( \int_0^\infty f(x)^2 \, dx \right) \left( \int_0^\infty x f(x) \, dx \right)
   \]
