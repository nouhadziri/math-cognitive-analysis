converges and find its sum.

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to figure out for which complex numbers z the series

1 + z/(2!) + z(z+1)/(3!) + z(z+1)(z+2)/(4!) + ... + z(z+1)...(z+n)/( (n+2)! ) + ...

converges, and then find its sum. Hmm. Let me start by writing out the general term of the series to see if I can recognize a pattern or relate it to a known series.

The series is: sum_{n=0}^infty [ z(z+1)...(z+n-1) / ( (n+1)! ) ] but wait, looking at the given terms:

The first term is 1, when n=0, so perhaps it's better to index starting from n=0.

Wait, let's check.

At n=0: 1 = z(z+1)...(z + n -1)/ ( (n+1)! ) but when n=0, that would be 1/(1!)=1, but z(z+1)...(z-1) would be an empty product, which is 1. So maybe the general term is [ z(z+1)...(z + n -1) ] / ( (n+1)! ) for n ≥ 0, since when n=0, the term is 1/(1!) = 1.

But wait, original series:

First term: 1 = 1 maybe corresponds to n=0?

Wait, the first term is 1, then z/(2! ), which would be n=1: z/(2! ), then next term n=2: z(z+1)/3!, etc. Wait perhaps the general term is [ z(z+1)...(z + (n-1)) ] / ( (n+1)! ) ) where n starts at 0. But when n=0: empty product over 1! would be 1. Then n=1: z / 2!, n=2: z(z+1)/3!, etc. So yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the general term for n ≥ 0 is:

Term_n = [ z(z+1)...(z + n -1) ] / ( (n + 1)! )

So the series is sum_{n=0}^infty Term_n.

Hmm. Okay, so need to analyze the convergence of this series.

First, recall that for complex series, absolute convergence implies convergence, so maybe check for absolute convergence first. So consider sum |Term_n|.

But since factorials in the denominator, maybe ratio test is a good idea. Let me try that.

Let me write Term_n = [ z(z+1)...(z + n -1) ] / ( (n + 1)! )

So Term_{n+1} = [ z(z+1)...(z + n -1)(z + n) ] / ( (n + 2)! )

Therefore, Term_{n+1} / Term_n = (z + n) / (n + 2)

Therefore, the ratio |Term_{n+1}/Term_n| = |z + n| / (n + 2)

So to find the limit as n approaches infinity of |z + n| / (n + 2)

Let me compute that:

|z + n| / (n + 2) = |n + z| / (n + 2)

As n approaches infinity, |n + z| is approximately |n|, since z is fixed and n growing. So numerator ~ n, denominator ~ n + 2 ~ n.

Therefore, the limit is n / n = 1. So ratio test is inconclusive.

But wait, when the ratio test gives 1, maybe we can do root test?

Alternatively, note that for large n, the terms behave like [n^{?}] ?

Alternatively, note that the terms Term_n = [ z(z + 1)...(z + n -1) ] / (n + 1 )!

Which resembles the coefficients of the binomial series or hypergeometric functions.

Wait, binomial coefficient coefficients look like (α choose n) = α(α -1)...(α - n +1)/n!

But in our case, we have z(z +1)...(z + n -1)/ (n + 1)! )

Hmm, so that's similar to ( (z + n -1) choose n ) multiplied by something? Not exactly. Alternatively, since rising factorials.

Wait, z(z +1)...(z + n -1) is the Pochhammer symbol (z)_n, which is the rising factorial.

Yes, actually sometimes denoted by (z)^{(n)} or (z)_n. So in terms of the Pochhammer symbol, Term_n = (z)_n / (n + 1)! )

Hmm. So maybe writing the series as sum_{n=0}^infty (z)_n / (n + 1)! )

I wonder if there's a generating function that matches this series. Let's think.

The generating function for the binomial series is sum_{n=0}^infty (α choose n) x^n = (1 + x)^α.

But in our case, there is a (z)_n in the numerator and (n + 1)! in the denominator.

Wait, maybe shifting the index, since (n + 1)! = (n + 1) * n! So perhaps:

sum_{n=0}^infty (z)_n / ( (n + 1)! ) = sum_{n=0}^infty (z)_n / ( (n + 1) n! ) ) = (1/(z)) sum_{n=0}^infty (z)_{n +1} / ( (n + 1)! ) )

Wait, perhaps integrating term-by-term. Think, since (z)_{n +1} = z(z +1)...(z + n ) ), which would be involved in the next term.

Wait, the series with terms (z)_n / n! is the hypergeometric series 1F0(z;;1), which diverges except when z is a negative integer. But that diverges, but here in our case we have (z)_n / ( (n +1)! ) so perhaps decreasing the denominator.

Alternatively, since (n +1)! = n! * (n +1), so sum becomes sum_{n=0}^\infty (z)_n / (n! (n +1)) )

But perhaps using generating functions. Let me think.

Suppose we have the series sum_{n=0}^\infty (z)_n t^n / n! = (1 - t)^{-z} for |t| <1. But that is the binomial theorem for negative exponents.

Wait, wait, the generating function is sum_{n=0}^\infty (z)_n t^n / n! = e^{t}? No, actually that's the confluent hypergeometric function.

Wait, actually, for the rising factorial. The sum of (a)_n t^n / n! is 1F1(a; ; t) ?

Wait, I might need to recall generating functions involving Pochhammer symbols.

Alternatively, if we define the generating function as F(t) = sum_{n=0}^\infty (z)_n t^n / (n + 1)! )

So, multiplying numerator and denominator by (n +1):

F(t) = sum_{n=0}^\infty (z)_n t^n / ( (n +1)! ) ) = sum_{n=0}^\infty (z)_n t^n / ( (n +1) n! )

Let me do substitution m = n +1, so n = m -1. Then,

F(t) = sum_{m=1}^\infty (z)_{m-1} t^{m-1} / ( m! ) )

Then,

F(t) = (1/t) sum_{m=1}^\infty (z)_{m-1} t^m / (m! ) )

Which is (1/t) [ sum_{m=0}^\infty (z)_{m-1} t^m / m! - (z)_{-1} t^0 /0! ]

But (z)_{-1} is 1/(z -1). Wait, the Pochhammer symbol (a)_n = a(a +1)...(a + n -1). For n=0, (a)_0=1. For negative n, (a)_{-n} = 1/( (a -1)(a -2)...(a - n) ) )

But when m=0 in the sum, (z)_{m -1} = (z)_{-1} = 1/(z -1). So perhaps dividing by m=0 term complicates things.

Alternatively, since starting the sum from m=1, perhaps:

F(t) = (1/t) sum_{m=1}^\infty (z)_{m -1} t^m / m! )

But note that sum_{m=1}^\infty (z)_{m -1} t^m / m! = t sum_{m=1}^\infty (z)_{m -1} t^{m -1} / m! )

Let me set k = m -1:

This becomes t sum_{k=0}^\infty (z)_k t^k / ( (k +1)! ) )

Which is similar to the original series multiplied by t. But not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, if we can relate the sum to an integral. Since 1/(k +1)! = 1/(k! (k +1)) ) = integral from 0 to1 of t^k /k! dt. Wait, integral of t^k from 0 to1 is 1/(k +1). So indeed, 1/(k +1) = integral_{0}^1 t^k dt.

Thus,

Sum_{k=0}^\infty (z)_k / (k +1)! ) = Sum_{k=0}^\infty (z)_k /k! * 1/(k +1 ) = Sum_{k=0}^\infty (z)_k /k! ∫_{0}^1 t^k dt = ∫_{0}^1 Sum_{k=0}^\infty (z)_k /k! t^k dt.

Interchanging sum and integral, assuming convergence.

So then,

Integral_{0}^1 Sum_{k=0}^\infty (z)_k t^k /k! dt = Integral_{0}^1 (1 - t)^{-z} dt, by the binomial theorem since Sum_{k=0}^\infty (z)_k t^k /k! = (1 - t)^{-z}.

But Wait, wait. Let me check. The generating function for the rising factorial is:

sum_{k=0}^\infty (a)_k t^k /k! = (1 - t)^{-a}, which converges for |t| <1. Hence, if I use a = z, then sum_{k=0}^\infty (z)_k t^k /k! = (1 - t)^{-z}, for |t| <1. So since our integral is over t from 0 to1, and t=1 is at the boundary. So integral becomes ∫_{0}^1 (1 - t)^{-z} dt.

Therefore, our sum S = Integral_{0}^1 (1 - t)^{-z} dt. Now, let's compute this integral.

Compute ∫_{0}^1 (1 - t)^{-z} dt. Let me substitute u =1 -t, so du = - dt, limits from u=1 to 0:

Thus, integral becomes ∫_{u=1}^0 u^{-z} (-du) )= ∫_{0}^1 u^{-z} du.

So Integral_{0}^1 u^{-z} du = [ u^{-z +1} / (-z +1) ) ]_{0}^1.

But this integral is convergent only if Re(-z +1) > 0, i.e., Re(z) <1. So that the integral converges when Re(z) <1. Otherwise, diverges. However, since we are working with complex numbers, convergence of the integral at u=0 requires that Re(-z) +1 >0 => Re(-z) > -1 => Re(z) <1. Hence, for Re(z) <1, the integral converges.

Wait, but this was under the assumption that the interchange of sum and integral is justified. So, if the sum converges and the interchange is valid, the integral would equal the sum. But if Re(z) <1, then Integral_{0}^1 u^{-z} du = [ u^{1 -z} / (1 - z ) ]_0^1 = 1/(1 -z ) - lim_{u->0} u^{1 -z}/(1 - z )

For Re(1 - z ) >0, which is same as Re(z ) <1. So then, the limit as u->0 of u^{1 -z } is 0, because Re(1 - z )=1 - Re(z ) >0. Therefore, the integral is 1/(1 - z ) for Re(z ) <1.

Therefore, sum S = 1/(1 - z )

But only when Re(z ) <1.

Wait, but does this mean that for Re(z ) <1, the series converges and sum is 1/(1 - z ) ?

But hang on. Earlier steps involved interchanging sum and integral via integrating (1 - t)^{-z} over t from 0 to1. However, the generating function sum (z )_k t^k /k! = (1 - t)^{-z} only converges for |t| <1, but our integral includes t=1. Therefore, we need to check if the summation converges at t=1? Wait, but the integral is over t from 0 to1, thus including t approaching 1.

But according to the generating function, sum_{k=0}^\infty (z)_k t^k /k! = (1 - t )^{-z }, and at t=1, the left-hand side would be sum_{k=0}^\infty (z)_k /k! = ... Well, sum_{k=0}^\infty (z )_k /k! = 2F0(z, 1;;1 ) but that hypergeometric series diverges except when z is a negative integer. But here, perhaps integrating ensures convergence.

Alternatively, since the original series converges when Re(z ) <1, but perhaps the radius of convergence related integration.

But the original approach was integrating sum_{k=0}^\infty (z )_k t^k /k! from t=0 to1, which termwise gives sum_{k=0}^\infty (z )_k /( (k +1 )! ), and this is equal to integral from0 to1 (1 - t )^{-z } dt = 1/(1 - z ), provided Re(z ) <1. Therefore, that suggests that under what condition the interchange is valid? If the original series converges uniformly on [0,1], then interchange is okay.

But we can check convergence of the original series. At t=1, the generating function sum_{k=0}^\infty (z )_k /k! diverges unless z is a negative integer.

But here, in our case, with additional 1/(k +1 )! which is 1/( (k +1 )k! ). Thus, the term in our original series is (z )_k / ( (k +1 )! ) ) = (z )_k / ( (k +1 )k! )

So the coefficient is roughly (z )_k / ( (k +1 )! ). Let's see, for large k, (z )_k = z(z +1)...(z +k -1 ) ~ k^z Γ(z ) / Γ(z ) ? Wait, as k tends to infinity, the asymptotic for Pochhammer symbol (z )_k = Γ(z +k ) / Γ(z ) ~ k^{z } Γ(k ) / Γ(z ) by Stirling's approximation.

But Γ(k ) ~ (k -1 )! ~ sqrt(2π(k -1 )) ( (k -1 )/e )^{k -1 }, but when divided by (k +1 )! = (k +1 )k! , the term would be ~ [ Γ(z +k ) / (k +1 )! ) ] / Γ(z ) ~ k^{z } / ( (k +1 )k ) ) ~ k^{z -1 } / (k +1 ). So terms ~ k^{ z -2 }.

Therefore, the general term of the series behaves like k^{z -2 }, so to converge, we need that |k^{ z -2 }| = k^{ Re(z ) -2 } tends to 0 as k approaches infinity.

Therefore, for convergence, we need Re(z ) -2 < -1 => Re(z ) <1, which aligns with the integral condition.

Thus, the series converges absolutely when Re(z ) <1, conditionally? Not sure, but absolutely.

For |z | >=1, but Re(z ) <1, maybe absolute divergence but conditional convergence.

Wait, actual terms: if Re(z ) <1, term behaves like k^{ Re(z ) -2 }, and since Re(z ) -2 < -1, so terms decay like 1/k^{1 + (1 - Re(z )) }, so convergent.

Therefore, sum converges absolutely for Re(z ) <1. Then, for Re(z ) >=1, need to check.

If Re(z ) =1, then term behaves like1/k^{1 }, harmonic series, which diverges. For Re(z ) >1, terms decay like k^{ Re(z ) -2 }, exponent Re(z ) -2 > -1, but even positive. So term ~ positive exponent, so the terms actually grow? No, Re(z ) -2 >-1 => Re(z ) >1. If Re(z ) >1, then Re(z ) -2 = Re(z ) -2, which might be positive or negative depending. Wait for Re(z ) >2, then exponent is positive, so terms grow like k^{ Re(z ) -2 } which goes to infinity, so series diverges. For Re(z ) between1 and 2, Re(z ) -2 is between -1 and0, so terms decay like1/k^{ 2 - Re(z ) }, but since2 - Re(z ) <1, hence the series diverges for Re(z ) >1.

Therefore, convergence in Re(z ) <1.

So, conclusion: converges absolutely for Re(z ) <1, and diverges otherwise.

Thus, the sum S=1/(1 - z ), for Re(z ) <1.

Wait, but what if the integral equals to S =1/(1 - z ) with convergence Re(z ) <1, but the problem allows z complex, but the integral requires Re(z ) <1. Therefore, the original series converges for complex numbers z with Re(z ) <1, and sum S=1/(1 - z ).

Alternatively, let me test with a specific value. For example, z=0. Then, S should be sum 1 +0 +0 +... =1. But 1/(1 -0 )=1, which matches. z=1/2 (with Re(z )=1/2 <1 ). Then S=1/(1 -1/2 )=2. Let's compute first few terms.

Term0:1=1

Term1: z/2! = (1/2)/2=1/4; cumulative: 1 +1/4=5/4

Term2: z(z +1)/3! = (1/2)(3/2)/6= (3/4)/6=1/8; cumulative:5/4 +1/8=11/8=1.375

Term3:z(z+1)(z +2)/4!=(1/2)(3/2)(5/2)/24=(15/8)/24=15/192=5/64≈0.078125; cumulative≈1.453

Term4: ... Continuing, terms getting smaller, approaching 2.

Indeed, convergence seems plausible.

Therefore, the answer is that the series converges for all complex numbers z with Re(z ) <1, and the sum is1/(1 -z ).

So finally: converges when Re(z ) <1, sum is1/(1 - z ).

**Final Answer**
The series converges for all complex numbers \( z \) with \( \text{Re}(z) < 1 \) and its sum is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{1 - z}}\).
