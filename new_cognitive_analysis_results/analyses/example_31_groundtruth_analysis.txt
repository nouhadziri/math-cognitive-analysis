Problem:
Given are real numbers $x, y$. For any pair of real numbers $a_{0}, a_{1}$, define a sequence by $a_{n+2}=x a_{n+1}+y a_{n}$ for $n \geq 0$. Suppose that there exists a fixed nonnegative integer $m$ such that, for every choice of $a_{0}$ and $a_{1}$, the numbers $a_{m}, a_{m+1}, a_{m+3}$, in this order, form an arithmetic progression. Find all possible values of $y$.

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Note that $x=1$ (or $x=0$ ), $y=0$ gives a constant sequence, so it will always have the desired property. Thus, $y=0$ is one possibility. For the rest of the proof, assume $y \neq 0$. We will prove that $a_{m}$ and $a_{m+1}$ may take on any pair of values, for an appropriate choice of $a_{0}$ and $a_{1}$. Use induction on $m$. The case $m=0$ is trivial. Suppose that $a_{m}$ and $a_{m+1}$ can take on any value. Let $p$ and $q$ be any real numbers. By setting $a_{m}=\frac{q-x p}{y}($ remembering that $y \neq 0)$ and $a_{m+1}=p$, we get $a_{m+1}=p$ and $a_{m+2}=q$. Therefore, $a_{m+1}$ and $a_{m+2}$ can have any values if $a_{m}$ and $a_{m+1}$ can. That completes the induction. Now we determine the nonzero $y$ such that $a_{m}, a_{m+1}, a_{m+3}$ form an arithmetic sequence; that is, such that $a_{m+3}-a_{m+1}=a_{m+1}-a_{m}$. But because $a_{m+3}=\left(x^{2}+y\right) a_{m+1}+x y a_{m}$ by the recursion formula, we can eliminate $a_{m+3}$ from the equation, obtaining the equivalent condition $\left(x^{2}+y-2\right) a_{m+1}+(x y+1) a_{m}=0$. Because the pair $a_{m}, a_{m+1}$ can take on any values, this condition means exactly that $x^{2}+y-2=x y+1=0$. Then $x=-1 / y$, and $1 / y^{2}+y-2=0$, or $y^{3}-2 y^{2}+1=0$. One root of this cubic is $y=1$, and the remaining quadratic factor $y^{2}-y-1$ has the roots $(1 \pm \sqrt{5}) / 2$. Since each such $y$ gives an $x$ for which the condition holds, we conclude that the answer to the problem is $y=0,1$, or $(1 \pm \sqrt{5}) / 2$.

<explanation>The solver recognizes that since a_{m} and a_{m+1} can be any values (as proven by induction), the coefficients in the equation must be zero. This is a crucial logical deduction that transforms the problem from a sequence problem to an equation-solving problem.</explanation>
