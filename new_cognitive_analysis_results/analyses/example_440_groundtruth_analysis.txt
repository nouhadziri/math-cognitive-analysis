Problem:
A particle of mass m moves in a 1D potential given by V(x) = -α δ(x), where δ(x) is the usual Dirac delta function, and α is some positive constant. The particle is bound. Find the value of x0 such that the probability of finding the particle with |x|< x0 is exactly equal to 1/2.


Answer Choices:
(A) ln(2) [ℏ^2/2mα]
(B) ln(4) [ℏ^2/2mα]
(C) ln(2) [ℏ^2/mα^2]
(D) ln(4) [ℏ^2/mα^2]

<end>127</end>
<text>Probability is integral of |Ψ^2| in the given interval.</text>
<explanation>The solver correctly identifies that to find the probability of the particle being in a certain region, they need to integrate the squared magnitude of the wave function over that region. This shows understanding of the Born interpretation of quantum mechanics, a fundamental concept in quantum theory.</explanation>

<text>Taking the integral, we find ln(2) [ℏ^2/2mα^2].</text>
<explanation>The answer includes the term [ℏ^2/2mα^2], which has dimensions of length, appropriate for the variable x₀ being solved for. This suggests the solver is aware of the need for dimensional consistency in physical equations, even if not explicitly stated.</explanation>

<skill>Answer Verification</skill>
<definition>The process of checking one's solution against the given answer choices to select the correct option.</definition>

<start>184</start>
<end>185</end>
<text>A</text>
<explanation>The solver has selected answer choice A, which implies they compared their calculated result with the provided options. However, there appears to be a discrepancy, as the calculated result ln(2) [ℏ^2/2mα^2] doesn't match option A which is ln(2) [ℏ^2/2mα]. This suggests either an error in the final step of verification or in transcribing the answer.</explanation>
