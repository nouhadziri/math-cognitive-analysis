Problem:
A biologist wants to calculate the number of fish in a lake. On May 1 she catches a random sample of 60 fish, tags them, and releases them. On September 1 she catches a random sample of 70 fish and finds that 3 of them are tagged. To calculate the number of fish in the lake on May 1, she assumes that  $25\%$  of these fish are no longer in the lake on September 1 (because of death and emigrations), that  $40\%$  of the fish were not in the lake May 1 (because of births and immigrations), and that the number of untagged fish and tagged fish in the September 1 sample are representative of the total population. What does the biologist calculate for the number of fish in the lake on May 1?

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the estimated number of fish in the lake on May 1, based on a mark-recapture method with adjustments for population changes. Let $N_1$ be the number of fish in the lake on May 1, and $N_2$ be the number of fish in the lake on September 1.

We are given the following information:
- Number of fish tagged on May 1: $T = 60$.
- Number of fish in the sample taken on September 1: $n = 70$.
- Number of tagged fish in the September 1 sample: $k = 3$.

We are also given information about population changes between May 1 and September 1:
- $25\%$ of the fish present on May 1 are no longer in the lake on September 1. This means $100\% - 25\% = 75\%$ of the May 1 population remains.
- $40\%$ of the fish present on September 1 were not in the lake on May 1.

Let's use these percentages to relate $N_1$ and $N_2$.

The number of fish from the May 1 population that are still in the lake on September 1 is $0.75 \times N_1$.

The total number of fish in the lake on September 1, $N_2$, consists of the surviving fish from May 1 and the new fish (births and immigrations). The number of new fish is $40\%$ of $N_2$, so $0.40 \times N_2$.

The remaining $60\%$ of the September 1 population are the survivors from May 1, so $0.60 \times N_2 = 0.75 \times N_1$.
From this equation, we can relate $N_1$ and $N_2$:
$0.60 N_2 = 0.75 N_1$
$N_2 = \frac{0.75}{0.60} N_1 = \frac{75}{60} N_1 = \frac{5}{4} N_1 = 1.25 N_1$.

This means the population increased by $25\%$ between May 1 and September 1.

Now, let's consider the tagged fish. The number of tagged fish on May 1 is $T = 60$.
The number of tagged fish remaining in the lake on September 1 is $75\%$ of the initial number of tagged fish, because the same percentage of fish leaves the lake regardless of whether they are tagged or untagged.
Number of tagged fish on September 1 = $0.75 \times T = 0.75 \times 60 = 45$.

Let $M$ be the number of tagged fish in the lake on September 1. We have $M = 45$.

The biologist assumes that the proportion of tagged fish in the September 1 sample is representative of the proportion of tagged fish in the total population on September 1.
The proportion of tagged fish in the sample is $\frac{k}{n} = \frac{3}{70}$.
The proportion of tagged fish in the total population on September 1 is $\frac{M}{N_2} = \frac{45}{N_2}$.

Setting these proportions equal:
$\frac{3}{70} = \frac{45}{N_2}$

Now we can solve for $N_2$:
$3 N_2 = 70 \times 45$
$3 N_2 = 3150$
$N_2 = \frac{3150}{3} = 1050$.

So, the estimated number of fish in the lake on September 1 is $1050$.

Now we can use the relationship between $N_1$ and $N_2$ to find $N_1$:
$N_2 = 1.25 N_1$
$1050 = 1.25 N_1$
$N_1 = \frac{1050}{1.25} = \frac{1050}{\frac{5}{4}} = 1050 \times \frac{4}{5}$.

$N_1 = \frac{4200}{5} = 840$.

The biologist calculates the number of fish in the lake on May 1 to be $840$.

Let's double-check the reasoning and calculations.

Assumptions:
1. The sample taken on September 1 is a random sample.
2. Tagged and untagged fish have the same probability of being caught.
3. The mixing of tagged fish within the population is complete.
4. The information about population changes is accurate.

Let's retrace the steps with more formal notation.

Let $N_1$ = population size on May 1.
Let $N_2$ = population size on September 1.
Number of tagged fish on May 1 = $T = 60$.

Survival rate of fish from May 1 to September 1 = $1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.
Number of surviving fish from May 1 = $0.75 N_1$.

Proportion of new fish in September 1 population = $0.40$.
Proportion of old fish (survivors from May 1) in September 1 population = $1 - 0.40 = 0.60$.

So, $0.60 N_2 = $ number of surviving fish from May 1 $= 0.75 N_1$.
$0.60 N_2 = 0.75 N_1 \implies N_2 = \frac{0.75}{0.60} N_1 = 1.25 N_1$.

Number of tagged fish remaining on September 1 = $0.75 \times 60 = 45$.

Using the mark-recapture formula for the September 1 population:
$\frac{\text{number of tagged fish in sample}}{\text{total number in sample}} = \frac{\text{total number of tagged fish in population}}{\text{total population size}}$
$\frac{k}{n} = \frac{M}{N_2}$
$\frac{3}{70} = \frac{45}{N_2}$

Solving for $N_2$:
$3 N_2 = 70 \times 45 = 3150$
$N_2 = 1050$.

Now, using the relationship between $N_1$ and $N_2$:
$N_2 = 1.25 N_1$
$1050 = 1.25 N_1$
$N_1 = \frac{1050}{1.25} = 840$.

The calculation seems consistent. Let's think about the logic behind the assumptions.

The assumption that the number of untagged and tagged fish in the September 1 sample are representative of the total population on September 1 is the core of the mark-recapture method.

The adjustments for births, deaths, immigration, and emigration require careful handling of the population dynamics.

Consider the population of tagged fish. On May 1, there were 60 tagged fish. By September 1, 25% of them are assumed to be gone, so $0.25 \times 60 = 15$ tagged fish are lost. The number of tagged fish remaining is $60 - 15 = 45$.

Let $N_1$ be the population size on May 1.
Let the number of deaths and emigrations from May 1 to September 1 be $D = 0.25 N_1$.
Let the number of births and immigrations from May 1 to September 1 be $B$.

Population on September 1, $N_2 = N_1 - D + B = N_1 - 0.25 N_1 + B = 0.75 N_1 + B$.

We are given that $40\%$ of the fish in the lake on September 1 were not there on May 1. These are the births and immigrations.
So, $B = 0.40 N_2$.

Substituting this into the equation for $N_2$:
$N_2 = 0.75 N_1 + 0.40 N_2$
$N_2 - 0.40 N_2 = 0.75 N_1$
$0.60 N_2 = 0.75 N_1$
$N_2 = \frac{0.75}{0.60} N_1 = 1.25 N_1$. This confirms the relationship derived earlier.

Now, consider the proportion of tagged fish on September 1.
Number of tagged fish on September 1 = $60 \times (1 - 0.25) = 60 \times 0.75 = 45$.

The proportion of tagged fish in the population on September 1 is $\frac{45}{N_2}$.
The proportion of tagged fish in the sample on September 1 is $\frac{3}{70}$.

Assuming these proportions are equal:
$\frac{45}{N_2} = \frac{3}{70}$
$3 N_2 = 45 \times 70 = 3150$
$N_2 = 1050$.

Now, use the relationship $N_2 = 1.25 N_1$:
$1050 = 1.25 N_1$
$N_1 = \frac{1050}{1.25} = 840$.

The question asks for the number of fish in the lake on May 1, which is $N_1$.

Consider alternative approaches or potential pitfalls.

The core idea is to use the mark-recapture method on the September 1 population, accounting for the tagged fish that survived until then.

Let's think about the flow of fish:
Initial state (May 1): $N_1$ fish, 60 tagged.
Transition to September 1:
- Survival of May 1 population: $0.75 N_1$.
- Number of tagged survivors: $0.75 \times 60 = 45$.
- Number of new fish (births and immigrations): $B$.

Population on September 1: $N_2 = 0.75 N_1 + B$.

We are given that new fish constitute $40\%$ of $N_2$, so $B = 0.40 N_2$.
Substituting this: $N_2 = 0.75 N_1 + 0.40 N_2$, which leads back to $N_2 = 1.25 N_1$.

The sample on September 1 has 70 fish, 3 of which are tagged.
The proportion of tagged fish in the sample is $\frac{3}{70}$.
This proportion is assumed to be the same as the proportion of tagged fish in the total population on September 1:
$\frac{\text{number of tagged fish on Sep 1}}{\text{total population on Sep 1}} = \frac{45}{N_2}$.

So, $\frac{3}{70} = \frac{45}{N_2}$.
Solving for $N_2$ gives $N_2 = 1050$.

Finally, using the relationship between $N_1$ and $N_2$, we find $N_1$.

Sanity check:
If there were no population changes, the simple Lincoln-Petersen estimator would be:
$\frac{60}{N} = \frac{3}{70} \implies 3N = 4200 \implies N = 1400$.
This is the estimate if the population size was constant.

Now, consider the effects of population changes. The population increased from May 1 to September 1.

Let's think step-by-step about the information provided.

May 1: Population $N_1$, 60 tagged fish.
September 1: Population $N_2$, number of tagged fish = 45.

The sample on September 1 gives information about the proportion of tagged fish in the September 1 population.

Proportion of tagged in September 1 sample = $\frac{3}{70}$.
Proportion of tagged in September 1 population = $\frac{45}{N_2}$.

Equating these gives $N_2 = 1050$.

The information about the percentages of change relates $N_1$ and $N_2$.
$N_2 = 1.25 N_1$.

We found $N_2$, so we can find $N_1$.
$1050 = 1.25 N_1$
$N_1 = \frac{1050}{1.25} = 840$.

The question asks for the number of fish in the lake on May 1.

Consider edge cases or misunderstandings of the problem statement.
"To calculate the number of fish in the lake on May 1..." implies that the final answer should be an estimate of $N_1$.

The assumptions are crucial:
- Random sampling at both times.
- Tags are not lost and do not affect survival.
- Complete mixing of tagged fish.
- The given percentages of population change are accurate.

The structure of the problem involves two time points and population dynamics between them. The mark-recapture method is applied at the second time point.

If we had to estimate the population on September 1, the answer would be $N_2 = 1050$. But the question specifically asks for the number on May 1.

Let's write down the solution steps clearly.

1. Calculate the number of tagged fish remaining in the lake on September 1:
   Number of tagged fish on May 1 = 60.
   Fraction remaining on September 1 = $1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.
   Number of tagged fish on September 1 = $60 \times 0.75 = 45$.

2. Use the mark-recapture data from September 1 to estimate the population size on September 1 ($N_2$):
   Sample size on September 1 = 70.
   Number of tagged fish in the sample = 3.
   Proportion of tagged fish in the sample = $\frac{3}{70}$.
   Assuming this is representative of the population: $\frac{3}{70} = \frac{\text{number of tagged fish on Sep 1}}{N_2} = \frac{45}{N_2}$.
   Solving for $N_2$: $3 N_2 = 70 \times 45 = 3150 \implies N_2 = 1050$.

3. Use the information about population changes to relate $N_1$ and $N_2$:
   Let $N_1$ be the population on May 1, $N_2$ be the population on September 1.
   Number of survivors from May 1 = $0.75 N_1$.
   These survivors constitute $100\% - 40\% = 60\%$ of the September 1 population.
   $0.60 N_2 = 0.75 N_1$.
   $N_2 = \frac{0.75}{0.60} N_1 = 1.25 N_1$.

4. Solve for $N_1$:
   We have $N_2 = 1050$ and $N_2 = 1.25 N_1$.
   $1050 = 1.25 N_1$.
   $N_1 = \frac{1050}{1.25} = 840$.

The biologist calculates the number of fish in the lake on May 1 to be 840.
The wording of the question seems straightforward and the interpretation of the percentages appears correct. The assumptions underlying the mark-recapture method are standard.
Final check of calculations:
$0.75 \times 60 = 45$ (tagged fish on Sep 1)
$\frac{3}{70} = \frac{45}{N_2} \implies N_2 = \frac{45 \times 70}{3} = 15 \times 70 = 1050$.
$0.6 N_2 = 0.75 N_1 \implies N_1 = \frac{0.6}{0.75} N_2 = \frac{60}{75} N_2 = \frac{4}{5} N_2$.
$N_1 = 0.8 \times 1050 = 840$.

The calculations are consistent.
