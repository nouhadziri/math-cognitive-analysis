Problem:
There are real numbers $a, b, c,$ and $d$ such that $-20$ is a root of $x^3 + ax + b$ and $-21$ is a root of $x^3 + cx^2 + d.$ These two polynomials share a complex root $m + \sqrt{n} \cdot i,$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find $m+n.$

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the sum $m+n$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers related to a shared complex root of two cubic polynomials.

The first polynomial is $P(x) = x^3 + ax + b$. Since the coefficients are real, if $m + \sqrt{n} i$ is a root, then its conjugate $m - \sqrt{n} i$ is also a root.
The roots of $P(x)$ are $-20, m + \sqrt{n} i, m - \sqrt{n} i$.

The second polynomial is $Q(x) = x^3 + cx^2 + d$. Since the coefficients are real, if $m + \sqrt{n} i$ is a root, then its conjugate $m - \sqrt{n} i$ is also a root.
One root of $Q(x)$ is $-21$, and two other roots are $m + \sqrt{n} i, m - \sqrt{n} i$.

Let's use Vieta's formulas for the roots of $P(x)$.
Sum of the roots: $-20 + (m + \sqrt{n} i) + (m - \sqrt{n} i) = -20 + 2m$.
The coefficient of $x^2$ in $P(x)$ is $0$.
So, $-20 + 2m = 0 \implies 2m = 20 \implies m = 10$.
Since $m$ is a positive integer, this is consistent.

Sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time:
$(-20)(m + \sqrt{n} i) + (-20)(m - \sqrt{n} i) + (m + \sqrt{n} i)(m - \sqrt{n} i)$
$= -20m - 20\sqrt{n} i - 20m + 20\sqrt{n} i + (m^2 - (i\sqrt{n})^2)$
$= -40m + (m^2 - (-n))$
$= -40m + m^2 + n$.
The coefficient of $x$ in $P(x)$ is $a$.
So, $a = -40m + m^2 + n$.
Substitute $m = 10$: $a = -40(10) + (10)^2 + n = -400 + 100 + n = -300 + n$.

Product of the roots: $(-20)(m + \sqrt{n} i)(m - \sqrt{n} i) = -20(m^2 + n)$.
The constant term of $P(x)$ is $b$.
So, $-b = (-20)(m^2 + n) \implies b = 20(m^2 + n)$.
Substitute $m = 10$: $b = 20(10^2 + n) = 20(100 + n) = 2000 + 20n$.

Now let's use Vieta's formulas for the roots of $Q(x)$.
The roots are $-21, m + \sqrt{n} i, m - \sqrt{n} i$.

Sum of the roots: $-21 + (m + \sqrt{n} i) + (m - \sqrt{n} i) = -21 + 2m$.
The coefficient of $x^2$ in $Q(x)$ is $c$.
So, $-c = -21 + 2m$.
Substitute $m = 10$: $-c = -21 + 2(10) = -21 + 20 = -1$.
So, $c = 1$.

Sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time:
$(-21)(m + \sqrt{n} i) + (-21)(m - \sqrt{n} i) + (m + \sqrt{n} i)(m - \sqrt{n} i)$
$= -21m - 21\sqrt{n} i - 21m + 21\sqrt{n} i + (m^2 + n)$
$= -42m + m^2 + n$.
The coefficient of $x$ in $Q(x)$ is $0$.
So, $-42m + m^2 + n = 0$.
Substitute $m = 10$: $-42(10) + (10)^2 + n = 0$
$-420 + 100 + n = 0$
$-320 + n = 0 \implies n = 320$.

Since $n$ is a positive integer, this is consistent.

Product of the roots: $(-21)(m + \sqrt{n} i)(m - \sqrt{n} i) = -21(m^2 + n)$.
The constant term of $Q(x)$ is $d$.
So, $-d = (-21)(m^2 + n) \implies d = 21(m^2 + n)$.
Substitute $m = 10, n = 320$: $d = 21(10^2 + 320) = 21(100 + 320) = 21(420)$.
$d = 21 \times 420 = 21 \times 42 \times 10 = 882 \times 10 = 8820$.

We have found $m = 10$ and $n = 320$.
The question asks for $m+n$.
$m+n = 10 + 320 = 330$.

Let's double-check the calculations.

Polynomial $P(x) = x^3 + ax + b$, roots $-20, 10 + \sqrt{320} i, 10 - \sqrt{320} i$.
Sum of roots: $-20 + 10 + \sqrt{320} i + 10 - \sqrt{320} i = 0$. (Coefficient of $x^2$ is 0)
Sum of products of roots taken two at a time:
$(-20)(10 + \sqrt{320} i) + (-20)(10 - \sqrt{320} i) + (10 + \sqrt{320} i)(10 - \sqrt{320} i)$
$= -200 - 20\sqrt{320} i - 200 + 20\sqrt{320} i + (10^2 + (\sqrt{320})^2)$
$= -400 + 100 + 320 = -400 + 420 = 20$.
So, $a = 20$.
Using the formula $a = -300 + n = -300 + 320 = 20$. This matches.

Product of roots: $(-20)(10^2 + 320) = -20(100 + 320) = -20(420) = -8400$.
So, $-b = -8400 \implies b = 8400$.
Using the formula $b = 2000 + 20n = 2000 + 20(320) = 2000 + 6400 = 8400$. This matches.

Polynomial $Q(x) = x^3 + cx^2 + d$, roots $-21, 10 + \sqrt{320} i, 10 - \sqrt{320} i$.
Sum of roots: $-21 + 10 + \sqrt{320} i + 10 - \sqrt{320} i = -1$.
So, $-c = -1 \implies c = 1$. This matches the earlier calculation.

Sum of products of roots taken two at a time:
$(-21)(10 + \sqrt{320} i) + (-21)(10 - \sqrt{320} i) + (10 + \sqrt{320} i)(10 - \sqrt{320} i)$
$= -210 - 21\sqrt{320} i - 210 + 21\sqrt{320} i + (100 + 320)$
$= -420 + 420 = 0$.
The coefficient of $x$ is $0$. This matches the polynomial $Q(x)$.

Product of roots: $(-21)(10^2 + 320) = -21(420) = -8820$.
So, $-d = -8820 \implies d = 8820$. This matches the earlier calculation.

The values of $m$ and $n$ seem consistent.
We are given that $m$ and $n$ are positive integers.
We found $m = 10$, which is a positive integer.
We found $n = 320$, which is a positive integer.

The shared complex root is $m + \sqrt{n} i = 10 + \sqrt{320} i$.
We have $\sqrt{320} = \sqrt{64 \times 5} = 8\sqrt{5}$.
So the shared complex root is $10 + 8\sqrt{5} i$.
Here, $m = 10$ and $\sqrt{n} = 8\sqrt{5} = \sqrt{64 \times 5} = \sqrt{320}$, so $n = 320$.

Alternative approach:
Let the shared complex root be $z = m + \sqrt{n} i$.
Since the coefficients are real, the conjugate $\bar{z} = m - \sqrt{n} i$ is also a root of both polynomials.

For $P(x)$, the roots are $-20, z, \bar{z}$.
$P(x) = (x - (-20))(x - z)(x - \bar{z}) = (x + 20)(x^2 - (z + \bar{z})x + z\bar{z})$
$z + \bar{z} = (m + \sqrt{n} i) + (m - \sqrt{n} i) = 2m$.
$z\bar{z} = (m + \sqrt{n} i)(m - \sqrt{n} i) = m^2 + n$.
$P(x) = (x + 20)(x^2 - 2mx + m^2 + n)$
$P(x) = x^3 - 2mx^2 + (m^2 + n)x + 20x^2 - 40mx + 20(m^2 + n)$
$P(x) = x^3 + (20 - 2m)x^2 + (m^2 + n - 40m)x + 20(m^2 + n)$.

Comparing with $P(x) = x^3 + ax + b$:
Coefficient of $x^2$: $20 - 2m = 0 \implies 2m = 20 \implies m = 10$.
Coefficient of $x$: $a = m^2 + n - 40m$.
Constant term: $b = 20(m^2 + n)$.

For $Q(x)$, the roots are $-21, z, \bar{z}$.
$Q(x) = (x - (-21))(x - z)(x - \bar{z}) = (x + 21)(x^2 - 2mx + m^2 + n)$
$Q(x) = x^3 - 2mx^2 + (m^2 + n)x + 21x^2 - 42mx + 21(m^2 + n)$
$Q(x) = x^3 + (21 - 2m)x^2 + (m^2 + n - 42m)x + 21(m^2 + n)$.

Comparing with $Q(x) = x^3 + cx^2 + d$:
Coefficient of $x^2$: $c = 21 - 2m$.
Coefficient of $x$: $0 = m^2 + n - 42m$.
Constant term: $d = 21(m^2 + n)$.

From the coefficient of $x^2$ in $P(x)$, we found $m = 10$.
Substitute $m = 10$ into the coefficient of $x$ in $Q(x)$:
$0 = 10^2 + n - 42(10)$
$0 = 100 + n - 420$
$0 = n - 320 \implies n = 320$.

We need to ensure $m$ and $n$ are positive integers.
$m = 10 > 0$.
$n = 320 > 0$.

Now, we can find the other coefficients $a, b, c, d$.
$a = m^2 + n - 40m = 10^2 + 320 - 40(10) = 100 + 320 - 400 = 420 - 400 = 20$.
$b = 20(m^2 + n) = 20(10^2 + 320) = 20(100 + 320) = 20(420) = 8400$.
$c = 21 - 2m = 21 - 2(10) = 21 - 20 = 1$.
$d = 21(m^2 + n) = 21(10^2 + 320) = 21(420) = 8820$.

The polynomials are:
$P(x) = x^3 + 20x + 8400$.
Check if $-20$ is a root: $(-20)^3 + 20(-20) + 8400 = -8000 - 400 + 8400 = -8400 + 8400 = 0$. Yes.

$Q(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 8820$.
Check if $-21$ is a root: $(-21)^3 + (-21)^2 + 8820 = -9261 + 441 + 8820 = -9261 + 9261 = 0$. Yes.

The shared complex root is $m + \sqrt{n} i = 10 + \sqrt{320} i$.
If this is a root, then the quadratic factor is $(x - (10 + \sqrt{320} i))(x - (10 - \sqrt{320} i))$
$= (x - 10 - \sqrt{320} i)(x - 10 + \sqrt{320} i)$
$= ((x - 10) - \sqrt{320} i)((x - 10) + \sqrt{320} i)$
$= (x - 10)^2 - (\sqrt{320} i)^2$
$= (x - 10)^2 - (-320)$
$= x^2 - 20x + 100 + 320 = x^2 - 20x + 420$.

For $P(x)$, since $-20$ is a root, $(x + 20)$ is a factor.
$P(x) = (x + 20)(x^2 - 20x + 420) = x^3 - 20x^2 + 420x + 20x^2 - 400x + 8400 = x^3 + 20x + 8400$.
This matches the form $x^3 + ax + b$, with $a = 20, b = 8400$.

For $Q(x)$, since $-21$ is a root, $(x + 21)$ is a factor.
$Q(x) = (x + 21)(x^2 - 20x + 420) = x^3 - 20x^2 + 420x + 21x^2 - 420x + 8820 = x^3 + x^2 + 8820$.
This matches the form $x^3 + cx^2 + d$, with $c = 1, d = 8820$.

The problem asks for $m+n$.
$m = 10, n = 320$.
$m+n = 10 + 320 = 330$.

We have $\sqrt{320} = \sqrt{64 \times 5} = 8\sqrt{5}$.
So the shared complex root is $10 + 8\sqrt{5} i$.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates facility with complex number representation by simplifying the complex root into a more elegant form, showing understanding of how to work with square roots in complex expressions.</explanation>

<text>The shared complex root is $m + \sqrt{n} i = 10 + \sqrt{320} i$.
If this is a root, then the quadratic factor is $(x - (10 + \sqrt{320} i))(x - (10 - \sqrt{320} i))$
$= (x - 10 - \sqrt{320} i)(x - 10 + \sqrt{320} i)$
$= ((x - 10) - \sqrt{320} i)((x - 10) + \sqrt{320} i)$</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates advanced complex number manipulation by constructing a quadratic factor from complex conjugate roots, showing understanding of how complex roots translate into polynomial factors.</explanation>
