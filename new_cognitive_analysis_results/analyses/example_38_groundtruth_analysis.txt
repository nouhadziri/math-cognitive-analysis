Problem:
Ana, Bob, and Cao bike at constant rates of $8.6$ meters per second, $6.2$ meters per second, and $5$ meters per second, respectively. They all begin biking at the same time from the northeast corner of a rectangular field whose longer side runs due west. Ana starts biking along the edge of the field, initially heading west, Bob starts biking along the edge of the field, initially heading south, and Cao bikes in a straight line across the field to a point $D$ on the south edge of the field. Cao arrives at point $D$ at the same time that Ana and Bob arrive at $D$ for the first time. The ratio of the field's length to the field's width to the distance from point $D$ to the southeast corner of the field can be represented as $p : q : r$ , where $p$ , $q$ , and $r$ are positive integers with $p$ and $q$ relatively prime. Find $p+q+r$ .

<skill>Problem Representation</skill>
<definition>The ability to translate a word problem into appropriate mathematical structures, variables, and relationships that capture the essential elements of the problem.</definition>

<end>61</end>
<text>61</text>
<explanation>The solver has represented the entire problem and arrived at the final answer of 61. While we don't see the detailed steps, the fact that they reached the correct answer indicates they successfully translated the problem about bikers, their speeds, and field dimensions into appropriate mathematical relationships.</explanation>

<skill>Spatial Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to visualize, manipulate, and reason about objects in space, including understanding geometric relationships and visualizing movement through space.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>61</end>
<text>61</text>
<explanation>The problem involves bikers moving along and across a rectangular field, requiring the solver to mentally visualize the paths of Ana, Bob, and Cao in relation to the rectangular field. The solver needed to understand how these paths intersect at point D and how the dimensions of the field relate to these paths.</explanation>

<skill>Ratio and Proportion Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to understand, represent, and solve problems involving relationships between quantities expressed as ratios or proportions.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>61</end>
<text>61</text>
<explanation>The problem asks for a ratio p:q:r representing the field's length to width to distance from point D to the southeast corner. The answer 61 suggests the solver successfully determined this ratio and found that p+q+r=61, demonstrating their ability to work with ratios.</explanation>

<skill>Parameter Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and work with key parameters in a problem, understanding how they relate to each other and to the solution.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>61</end>
<text>61</text>
<explanation>The solver had to work with multiple parameters including the speeds of the three bikers (8.6, 6.2, and 5 m/s), the dimensions of the field (length and width), and the position of point D. Finding the correct answer indicates they successfully analyzed how these parameters relate to each other.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Modeling</skill>
<definition>The ability to represent real-world situations using algebraic equations and expressions, including defining variables and establishing relationships between them.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>61</end>
<text>61</text>
<explanation>To solve this problem, the solver likely created algebraic equations representing the times it takes each biker to reach point D, then set these times equal to each other. This modeling process was necessary to derive the relationship between the field's dimensions and the location of point D.</explanation>

<skill>Constraint Satisfaction</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and work with multiple constraints simultaneously, finding solutions that satisfy all given conditions.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>61</end>
<text>61</text>
<explanation>The problem contains multiple constraints: the bikers all start at the same time, they travel at different constant speeds, they follow specific paths, and they all reach point D simultaneously. The solver had to satisfy all these constraints to find the correct ratio.</explanation>

<skill>Number Theory Knowledge</skill>
<definition>Understanding and applying concepts from number theory, including properties of integers, divisibility, and concepts like relatively prime numbers.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>61</end>
<text>61</text>
<explanation>The problem specifies that p and q are relatively prime positive integers. The solver needed to understand this concept and ensure that their solution satisfied this condition, ultimately finding values that sum to 61.</explanation>
