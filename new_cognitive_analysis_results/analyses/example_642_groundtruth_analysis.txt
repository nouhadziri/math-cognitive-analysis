Problem:
B. How many times would the resolving power of the above microscope increase or decrease if the electron beam were replaced with the proton beam? Assume that the resolving power of the microscope (i.e. the smallest distance between two point objects whose circular images can be just separated) depends only on the wave properties of the particles.

Assume that the velocities of the electrons and protons before their acceleration are zero, and that there is no interaction between own magnetic moment of either electrons or protons and the magnetic field. Assume also that the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the moving particles can be neglected.

NOTE: Very often physicists use 1 electron-volt $(1 \mathrm{eV})$, and its derivatives such as 1 $\mathrm{keV}$ or $1 \mathrm{MeV}$, as a unit of energy. 1 electron-volt is the energy gained by the electron that passed the potential difference equal to $1 \mathrm{~V}$.

Perform the calculations assuming the following data:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\text { Rest energy of electron: } & E_{e}=m_{e} c^{2}=511 \mathrm{keV} \\
\text { Rest energy of proton: } & E_{p}=m_{p} c^{2}=938 \mathrm{MeV}
\end{array}
$$

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
PART B

The resolving power of the microscope (in the meaning mentioned in the text of the problem) is proportional to the wavelength, in our case to the length of the de Broglie wave:

$$
\lambda=\frac{h}{p}
$$

where $h$ denotes the Planck constant and $p$ is the momentum of the particle. We see that $\lambda$ is inversely proportional to the momentum of the particle. Therefore, after replacing the electron beam with the proton beam the resolving power will be changed by the factor $p / p^{\prime} \approx 1 / 35$. It means that our proton microscope would allow observation of the objects about 35 times smaller than the electron microscope.
