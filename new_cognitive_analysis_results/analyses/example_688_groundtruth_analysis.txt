Problem:
Let  $ f(t)$  be a continuous function on the interval  $ 0 \leq t \leq 1$ , and define the two sets of points \[ A_t\equal{}\{(t,0): t\in[0,1]\} , B_t\equal{}\{(f(t),1): t\in [0,1]\}.\] Show that the union of all segments  $ \overline{A_tB_t}$  is Lebesgue-measurable, and find the minimum of its measure with respect to all functions  $ f$ . [A. Csaszar]

Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Show that the set \( A = \bigcup_{0 \le t \le 1} \overline{A_tB_t} \) is closed:**

   - Let \( P_n \) be a convergent sequence of points in \( A \), such that \( P_n \to P_0 \).
   - By the definition of \( A \), for every \( n \), there exists a \( t_n \) such that \( P_n \in \overline{A_{t_n}B_{t_n}} \).
   - According to the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, the sequence \( t_n \) contains a convergent subsequence: \( t_{n_k} \to t_0 \).
   - The distance from the point \( P_{n_k} \) to the segment \( \overline{A_{t_0}B_{t_0}} \) is not greater than \( \max \{|f(t_{n_k}) - f(t_0)|, |t_{n_k} - t_0|\} \), which tends to \( 0 \) by the continuity of \( f(t) \).
   - Since \( A \) contains the limit point of any convergent sequence of its points, \( A \) is closed.

2. **Show that the set \( A \) is Lebesgue-measurable:**

   - Since \( A \) is closed, it is also Lebesgue-measurable.

3. **Determine the minimum measure of \( A \):**

   - Consider the point on the segment \( \overline{A_tB_t} \) that lies on the straight line \( y = c \). The abscissa of this point is \( (1 - c)t + cf(t) \), which is a continuous function of \( t \) due to the continuity of \( f(t) \).
   - Consequently, if two points of the set \( A \) lie on the line \( y = c \), then \( A \) contains the segment that joins these points.

4. **Calculate the measure of \( A \) for different functions \( f(t) \):**

   - If \( f(t) \) is constant, then \( A \) is a triangle of unit base and unit altitude, so it has measure \( \frac{1}{2} \).
   - If the segments \( \overline{A_0B_0} \) and \( \overline{A_1B_1} \) do not intersect, then the trapezoid with vertices \( A_0 \), \( B_0 \), \( A_1 \), and \( B_1 \) is a subset of \( A \), so the measure of \( A \) is not less than \( \frac{1}{2} \).
   - If the segments \( \overline{A_0B_0} \) and \( \overline{A_1B_1} \) intersect at some point \( C \), then the triangles \( A_0CA_1 \) and \( B_0CB_1 \) are subsets of \( A \), so the measure of \( A \) is not smaller than:
     \[
     t(d) = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{1}{1 + d} + \frac{d}{1 + d}d \right) = \frac{1}{2}\frac{1 + d^2}{1 + d},
     \]
     where \( d \) denotes the distance from \( B_0 \) to \( B_1 \).

5. **Find the minimum of \( t(d) \):**

   - By a simple calculation, we obtain that the minimum of \( t(d) \) on the positive half-axis is \( \sqrt{2} - 1 \).
   - Thus, the measure of \( A \) cannot be less than \( \sqrt{2} - 1 \).
   - On the other hand, for \( f(t) = (\sqrt{2} - 1)(1 - t) \), the measure of \( A \) is exactly \( \sqrt{2} - 1 \).

\(\blacksquare\)

The final answer is \( \boxed{ \sqrt{2} - 1 } \).
