Problem:
iv. At some radius $r_{3} \ll r_{0}$, the gas becomes dense enough to be opaque to the heat radiation. Calculate the amount of heat $Q$ radiated away during the collapse from the radius $r_{0}$ down to $r_{3}$.

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
The problem asks for the amount of heat radiated away during the collapse of a gas cloud from radius $r_0$ to $r_3$, where $r_3 \ll r_0$. The key information is that the gas becomes opaque to heat radiation at radius $r_3$.

During the collapse, the gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy and heat. The heat is then radiated away. We are interested in the total heat radiated *before* the cloud becomes opaque. Once the cloud becomes opaque, the heat is trapped inside.

Let's consider the energy balance during the collapse. The change in total energy of the cloud is equal to the work done on the cloud by gravity plus the heat added to the cloud. Since heat is radiated away, we can think of it as negative heat added.

The gravitational potential energy of a uniform sphere of mass $M$ and radius $r$ is $U = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{GM^2}{r}$.

The initial gravitational potential energy at radius $r_0$ is $U_i = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{GM^2}{r_0}$.
The gravitational potential energy at radius $r_3$ is $U_f = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{GM^2}{r_3}$.

The change in gravitational potential energy during the collapse from $r_0$ to $r_3$ is $\Delta U = U_f - U_i = -\frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$.
Since $r_3 \ll r_0$, $\frac{1}{r_3} \gg \frac{1}{r_0}$, so $\Delta U \approx -\frac{3}{5} \frac{GM^2}{r_3}$. This is a negative value, meaning the potential energy decreases.

This decrease in potential energy must go into other forms of energy. Assuming the cloud starts from rest and ends nearly at rest (just before becoming opaque), the change in kinetic energy is negligible. Therefore, the decrease in potential energy is primarily balanced by the internal energy increase and the energy radiated away.

Let $E_{int}$ be the internal energy of the gas. The change in internal energy $\Delta E_{int}$ is related to the temperature change. However, the problem does not provide information about the temperature or the equation of state of the gas.

Let $Q$ be the amount of heat radiated away. From the first law of thermodynamics, $\Delta E = W + Q$, where $\Delta E$ is the change in total energy (internal + kinetic), $W$ is the work done on the system, and $Q$ is the heat added to the system. In our case, the work done by gravity is the negative of the change in potential energy: $W = - \Delta U_{grav}$. The heat added to the system is the negative of the heat radiated away: $Q_{therm} = -Q_{radiated}$.

Considering the energy conservation from the initial state at $r_0$ to the state just before becoming opaque at $r_3$:
Change in total energy = Change in potential energy + Change in kinetic energy + Change in internal energy.

Assuming the initial and final kinetic energies are negligible, the change in total energy is approximately the change in internal energy.

However, it's more direct to consider the energy lost by the system as radiation. The amount of energy lost by radiation is the difference between the initial and final total energy, assuming no other energy input.

Let's consider the process in small steps. As the cloud collapses from radius $r$ to $r-dr$, the change in gravitational potential energy is $dU = \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \frac{1}{r^2} dr$. This energy is either radiated away or increases the internal energy of the gas.

The key insight here is that the question asks for the heat radiated *until* the point where the gas becomes opaque. This means we are considering the process before the opacity significantly traps the radiation. During this phase, we can assume that most of the released potential energy is radiated away.

Consider the total change in potential energy from $r_0$ to $r_3$:
$\Delta U = U(r_3) - U(r_0) = -\frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$

The magnitude of this change is $|\Delta U| = \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$.
Since $r_3 \ll r_0$, $\frac{1}{r_3} \gg \frac{1}{r_0}$, so $|\Delta U| \approx \frac{3}{5} \frac{GM^2}{r_3}$.

If all the released potential energy were radiated away, then $Q = |\Delta U|$. However, some of this energy will go into increasing the internal energy of the gas.

The problem statement implies that the opacity at $r_3$ is a critical point. Before reaching $r_3$, the gas is relatively transparent, allowing heat to escape.

Let's think about the energy budget. As the cloud collapses from $r_0$ to some intermediate radius $r$, the amount of gravitational potential energy released is $\frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$. This energy goes into increasing the internal energy and being radiated away.

When the radius reaches $r_3$, the gas becomes opaque. This means that the radiation generated *before* reaching $r_3$ could escape. The radiation generated *after* reaching $r_3$ is trapped.

So, the amount of heat radiated away during the collapse from $r_0$ down to $r_3$ is the total amount of potential energy released during this phase, assuming that the internal energy change is small compared to the radiated energy or that we are considering the energy that *would have been* radiated if the gas remained transparent.

Consider the energy difference between the state at $r_0$ and the state just before reaching $r_3$. The change in gravitational potential energy is $\Delta U = -\frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$.

The energy released by gravity is $|\Delta U| = \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$.

If we assume that all this released energy is radiated away before opacity sets in, then the amount of heat radiated is $Q = \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$.

Since $r_3 \ll r_0$, $\frac{1}{r_3} \gg \frac{1}{r_0}$, so $Q \approx \frac{3}{5} \frac{GM^2}{r_3}$.

Let's re-read the question carefully: "Calculate the amount of heat $Q$ radiated away during the collapse from the radius $r_{0}$ down to $r_{3}$."  This implies we are looking at the total radiation emitted during this specific phase of the collapse.

The point at which the gas becomes opaque marks a transition. Before this point, radiation can escape.

Consider a small change in radius $dr$. The change in potential energy is $dU_g = \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \frac{1}{r^2} dr$. If the gas is transparent, this energy is radiated away.

The total heat radiated during the collapse from $r_0$ to $r_3$ is the integral of the energy released due to the change in gravitational potential.

$Q = \int_{r_0}^{r_3} - \frac{dU_g}{dr} dr = \int_{r_0}^{r_3} - \frac{d}{dr} \left( -\frac{3}{5} \frac{GM^2}{r} \right) dr = \int_{r_0}^{r_3} -\frac{3}{5} GM^2 \frac{1}{r^2} dr$
$Q = -\frac{3}{5} GM^2 \int_{r_0}^{r_3} \frac{1}{r^2} dr = -\frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left[ -\frac{1}{r} \right]_{r_0}^{r_3} = \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \right]_{r_0}^{r_3}$
$Q = \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$

This calculation assumes that all the released potential energy is radiated away, which is valid if the gas is transparent. The problem states that opacity sets in at $r_3$. Therefore, up until just before reaching $r_3$, the gas is assumed to be transparent enough for radiation to escape effectively.

The amount of heat radiated away is equal to the change in the binding energy of the cloud from radius $r_0$ to $r_3$.

Consider the energy of the system at radius $r$. If the gas is transparent, a small contraction $dr$ releases energy that is radiated away.

The total energy of the cloud can be thought of as the sum of its gravitational potential energy and internal energy. If the change in internal energy is negligible compared to the radiated energy, then the radiated energy is approximately the change in potential energy.

However, the internal energy will increase as the cloud collapses due to compression. The question asks for the heat radiated, which is the energy that leaves the system as radiation.

Let's consider the first law of thermodynamics for the collapsing cloud as the system:
$\Delta U_{total} = Q + W$
where $\Delta U_{total}$ is the change in the total energy of the cloud (internal + kinetic), $Q$ is the heat added to the cloud (heat radiated away is negative), and $W$ is the work done on the cloud by gravity.

$W = - \Delta U_{grav} = - (U_{grav, f} - U_{grav, i}) = U_{grav, i} - U_{grav, f}$
$W = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{GM^2}{r_0} - \left( -\frac{3}{5} \frac{GM^2}{r_3} \right) = \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$

If the collapse is slow (quasi-static), the kinetic energy is negligible. The change in total energy is approximately the change in internal energy: $\Delta U_{total} \approx \Delta E_{int}$.

$\Delta E_{int} = Q + \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$

The heat radiated away is $-Q$. Let $Q_{rad} = -Q$.
$\Delta E_{int} = -Q_{rad} + \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$
$Q_{rad} = \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right) - \Delta E_{int}$

If the gas remains ideal and cools as it radiates, the change in internal energy might be small. However, the problem doesn't give information about the temperature or equation of state.

The crucial point is the transition to opacity at $r_3$. Before this, the heat generated can escape. The total amount of energy that *becomes available* for radiation due to the change in gravitational potential energy is $\frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$.

If the gas were perfectly transparent, all this energy would be radiated. The fact that it becomes opaque at $r_3$ means that we are interested in the radiation emitted *before* this point.

Consider the luminosity of the cloud. If the luminosity is $L$, then the total radiated energy is $\int L dt$. However, we don't have information about the luminosity as a function of time or radius.

The wording of the question seems to imply a direct calculation based on the change in gravitational potential energy. The opacity at $r_3$ sets the limit for this calculation.

The energy released by gravity during the collapse from $r_0$ to $r_3$ is $\Delta E_{grav} = |U(r_3) - U(r_0)| = \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$.

If this energy is radiated away, then $Q = \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$.

The internal energy of the gas will increase due to compression. However, the heat radiation is a process that removes energy from the system. The question asks for the *amount of heat radiated away*.

Consider the energy flow. As the cloud collapses, gravitational potential energy is converted. Some of it goes into internal energy, and some is radiated away. If the gas is transparent, the radiated energy comes from the released gravitational potential energy.

The moment the gas becomes opaque, the radiation can no longer freely escape. Therefore, the total heat radiated away during the collapse down to $r_3$ is the amount of energy lost by the cloud in the form of radiation before this opacity sets in.

The change in total energy of the cloud from radius $r_0$ to $r_3$ is $\Delta E_{total} = E_{total}(r_3) - E_{total}(r_0)$.
If we consider a slow collapse, the kinetic energy is negligible.
$\Delta E_{total} \approx \Delta U_{grav} + \Delta E_{int}$.

The heat radiated away is the energy that leaves the system.
Energy conservation: $E_{initial} = E_{final} + E_{radiated}$
$U_{grav}(r_0) + E_{int}(r_0) = U_{grav}(r_3) + E_{int}(r_3) + Q$
$Q = (U_{grav}(r_0) - U_{grav}(r_3)) + (E_{int}(r_0) - E_{int}(r_3))$
$Q = -\Delta U_{grav} - \Delta E_{int}$
$Q = \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right) - \Delta E_{int}$

However, the question asks for the heat radiated *during* the collapse down to $r_3$. This implies we are summing the radiative losses during this process.

If the gas were always transparent, the rate of radiation would balance the rate of release of gravitational potential energy.

The opacity at $r_3$ is a key marker. Before this point, the assumption of transparency holds, and the radiated heat comes from the released potential energy.

The amount of heat radiated away can be calculated by considering the energy budget up to the point just before opacity.

Consider the work done by gravity: $W = \int_{r_0}^{r_3} F_{grav} dr$.
The energy released by gravity is $\frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$.

If all this energy is radiated away, then $Q = \frac{3}{5} GM^2 \left( \frac{1}{r_3} - \frac{1}{r_0} \right)$.

The fact that the gas becomes opaque at $r_3$ suggests that the radiation emitted *after* reaching this radius is trapped. We are interested in the radiation emitted *before* this happens.

Final check: The problem asks for the amount of heat radiated away during the collapse from $r_0$ to $r_3$. This is the total energy lost by the cloud as radiation during this phase. The transition to opacity at $r_3$ means that our calculation should consider the process up to this point, assuming the gas is transparent enough for radiation to escape.

The energy released by gravity is the source of this radiation.
