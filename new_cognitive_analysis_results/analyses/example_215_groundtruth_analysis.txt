Problem:
Let  $\rho:G\to GL(V)$  be a representation of a finite  $p$ -group  $G$  over a field of characteristic  $p$ . Prove that if the restriction of the linear map  $\sum_{g\in G} \rho(g)$  to a finite dimensional subspace  $W$  of  $V$  is injective, then the subspace spanned by the subspaces  $\rho(g)W$   $(g\in G)$  is the direct sum of these subspaces.

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
To prove that if the restriction of the linear map $\sum_{g\in G} \rho(g)$ to a finite dimensional subspace $W$ of $V$ is injective, then the subspace spanned by the subspaces $\rho(g)W$ $(g\in G)$ is the direct sum of these subspaces, we will proceed as follows:

1. **Lemma 1:**
   Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field with $char(\mathbb{F}) = p$, and let $\rho: G \to GL(V)$ be a representation of a finite $p$-group $G$ with $\dim V = n$. We need to show that for any $g_1, \ldots, g_n \in G$, we have:
   \[
   \prod_{i=1}^n (\rho(g_i) - I) = 0.
   \]
   **Proof of Lemma 1:**
   Since $G$ is a finite $p$-group, every element $g \in G$ has order $p^k$ for some $k$. Therefore, $\rho(g)$ is a matrix such that $\rho(g)^{p^k} = I$. Over a field of characteristic $p$, the minimal polynomial of $\rho(g)$ divides $x^{p^k} - 1 = (x-1)^{p^k}$. Hence, $\rho(g)$ is similar to an upper triangular matrix with $1$ on the diagonal. Consequently, $(\rho(g) - I)^n = 0$ for some $n \leq \dim V$. This proves the lemma.

2. **Lemma 2:**
   Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field with $char(\mathbb{F}) = p$, $G$ a finite $p$-group, and $V$ a vector space with $\dim V = n$. Denote the group algebra $A = \mathbb{F}[G]$ with basis $\{e_g\}_{g \in G}$, where $e_g e_f = e_{gf}$. For the vector space $A$, define the left $A$-module $M = A \otimes V$, where for any $a \in A$ and $x = \sum_{i, j} a_i \otimes v_j \in A \otimes V$, we have $a \cdot x = \sum_{i, j} (a a_i) \otimes v_j$. We need to show that for any $x \in M \setminus \{0\}$, there exist $a \in A$ and $v \in V \setminus \{0\}$ such that $a \cdot x = \sum_{g \in G} e_g \otimes v$.

   **Proof of Lemma 2:**
   Let $N$ be the minimal integer such that there exist $g_1, \ldots, g_N \in G$ with $\prod_{i=1}^N (e_{g_i} - 1) \cdot x \neq 0$. From Lemma 1, we know that $N \leq n < \infty$. For $a = \prod_{i=1}^N (e_{g_i} - 1) \in A$, by the definition of $N$, we have $(e_f a - a) \cdot x = 0$ for all $f \in G$. If $a \cdot x = \sum_{g \in G} e_g \otimes v_g$, then $(e_f a - a) \cdot x = 0$ implies $\sum_{g \in G} e_g \otimes (v_{f^{-1}g} - v_g) = 0$. Therefore, $v_{f^{-1}g} = v_g$ for all $g, f \in G$, which means $v_g = v_e$ for all $g \in G$. Hence, $a \cdot x = \sum_{g \in G} e_g \otimes v_e \neq 0$ with $v_e \neq 0$. This completes the proof of Lemma 2.

3. **Solution to the Main Problem:**
   Denote the group algebra $A = \mathbb{F}[G]$ with basis $\{e_g\}_{g \in G}$, where $e_g e_f = e_{gf}$. Let $\phi: A \to \text{Mat}_{n \times n}$ be a homomorphism such that for any $a = \sum_{g \in G} \lambda_g e_g \in A$, we have $\phi(a) = \sum_{g \in G} \lambda_g \rho(g)$. For the vector space $A$, define the left $A$-module $M = A \otimes W$, where for any $a \in A$ and $x = \sum_{i, j} a_i \otimes w_j \in A \otimes W$, we have $a \cdot x = \sum_{i, j} (a a_i) \otimes w_j$. Denote the homomorphism $\psi: M \to V$ by $\psi(x) = \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w_g$ for $x = \sum_{g \in G} e_g \otimes w_g \in M$.

   Suppose there exists $\{w_g \in W\}_{g \in G}$ such that $\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w_g = 0$. Then for $\alpha = \sum_{g \in G} e_g \otimes w_g \in M$, we have $\psi(\alpha) = \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w_g = 0$. If $\alpha \neq 0$, then by Lemma 2, there exist $a \in A$ and $w \in W \setminus \{0\}$ such that $a \cdot \alpha = \sum_{g \in G} e_g \otimes w$. It follows that $\psi(a \cdot \alpha) = \phi(a) \psi(\alpha) = 0 = \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w$. Since $w \in W \cap \ker \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) = \{0\}$, we have $w = 0$, which contradicts $w \neq 0$. Therefore, $\alpha = 0$, and hence $w_g = 0$ for all $g \in G$. This implies that the subspace spanned by the subspaces $\rho(g)W$ $(g \in G)$ is the direct sum of these subspaces.

<end>3952</end>
<text>Suppose there exists $\{w_g \in W\}_{g \in G}$ such that $\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w_g = 0$. Then for $\alpha = \sum_{g \in G} e_g \otimes w_g \in M$, we have $\psi(\alpha) = \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w_g = 0$. If $\alpha \neq 0$, then by Lemma 2, there exist $a \in A$ and $w \in W \setminus \{0\}$ such that $a \cdot \alpha = \sum_{g \in G} e_g \otimes w$. It follows that $\psi(a \cdot \alpha) = \phi(a) \psi(\alpha) = 0 = \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w$. Since $w \in W \cap \ker \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) = \{0\}$, we have $w = 0$, which contradicts $w \neq 0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver employs proof by contradiction by assuming that there exists a non-trivial linear combination of elements from the subspaces that equals zero, and then derives a contradiction.

<text>1. **Lemma 1:**
   Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field with $char(\mathbb{F}) = p$, and let $\rho: G \to GL(V)$ be a representation of a finite $p$-group $G$ with $\dim V = n$. We need to show that for any $g_1, \ldots, g_n \in G$, we have:
   \[
   \prod_{i=1}^n (\rho(g_i) - I) = 0.
   \]
   **Proof of Lemma 1:**
   Since $G$ is a finite $p$-group, every element $g \in G$ has order $p^k$ for some $k$. Therefore, $\rho(g)$ is a matrix such that $\rho(g)^{p^k} = I$. Over a field of characteristic $p$, the minimal polynomial of $\rho(g)$ divides $x^{p^k} - 1 = (x-1)^{p^k}$. Hence, $\rho(g)$ is similar to an upper triangular matrix with $1$ on the diagonal. Consequently, $(\rho(g) - I)^n = 0$ for some $n \leq \dim V$. This proves the lemma.
