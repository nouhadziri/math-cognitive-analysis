Problem:
Let $v$ and $w$ be distinct, randomly chosen roots of the equation $z^{1997}-1=0.$  Find the probability that
\[\sqrt{2+\sqrt{3}}\le\left|v+w\right|.\]

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
The solutions of the equation $z^{1997} = 1$ are the $1997$th roots of unity and are equal to $\cos\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right)$ for $k = 0,1,\ldots,1996.$  They are also located at the vertices of a regular $1997$-gon that is centered at the origin in the complex plane.

By rotating around the origin, we can assume that $v = 1.$  Then
\begin{align*}
|v + w|^2 & = \left|\cos\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right) + 1 \right|^2 \\
& = \left|\left[\cos\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right) + 1\right] + i\sin\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right)\right|^2 \\
& = \cos^2\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right) + 2\cos\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right) + 1 + \sin^2\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right) \\
& = 2 + 2\cos\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right).
\end{align*}We want $|v + w|^2\ge 2 + \sqrt {3}.$  From what we just obtained, this is equivalent to $\cos\left(\frac {2\pi k}{1997}\right)\ge \frac {\sqrt {3}}2.$  This occurs when $\frac {\pi}6\ge \frac {2\pi k}{1997}\ge - \frac {\pi}6$ which is satisfied by $k = 166,165,\ldots, - 165, - 166$ (we don't include 0 because that corresponds to $v$).  So out of the $1996$ possible $k$, $332$ work.  Thus, the desired probability is $\frac{332}{1996} = \boxed{\frac{83}{499}}.$
