Problem:
Jane is 25 years old. Dick is older than Jane. In $n$ years, where $n$ is a positive integer, Dick's age and Jane's age will both be two-digit numbers and will have the property that Jane's age is obtained by interchanging the digits of Dick's age. Let $d$ be Dick's present age. How many ordered pairs of positive integers $(d,n)$ are possible?

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
25

Analysis:
I'll analyze the cognitive skills demonstrated in this thinking trajectory for the mathematical problem.

<skill>Problem Representation</skill>
<definition>The ability to interpret a problem and mentally represent its structure, constraints, and relationships between variables.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>25</end>
<text>25</text>
<explanation>The solver has represented the problem by identifying Jane's current age as 25, which is a crucial piece of information from the problem statement. This shows they are beginning to organize the key information, though the representation is minimal in this trajectory.</explanation>

<skill>Numerical Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to work with numbers, understand their properties, and make inferences based on numerical relationships.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>25</end>
<text>25</text>
<explanation>The solver has noted Jane's age as 25, which demonstrates basic numerical reasoning by identifying a key numerical value from the problem. This is an initial step in working with the numerical constraints of the problem.</explanation>

<skill>Working Memory</skill>
<definition>The cognitive system responsible for temporarily holding and manipulating information needed for complex cognitive tasks.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>25</end>
<text>25</text>
<explanation>The solver has held in working memory the fact that Jane is 25 years old, which is a key piece of information from the problem. Though minimal, this demonstrates the beginning of using working memory to track relevant information.</explanation>

<skill>Attention to Detail</skill>
<definition>The ability to focus on specific elements of a problem and notice important details that constrain the solution.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>25</end>
<text>25</text>
<explanation>The solver has focused on Jane's current age of 25, which shows attention to a specific detail from the problem statement. This detail is crucial for solving the problem as it establishes the starting point for calculating future ages.</explanation>
