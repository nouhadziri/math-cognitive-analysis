Problem:
Which one of the following is the least correct statement about the following post-transcription processes?


Answer Choices:
(A) Some histone mRNAs end in a stem loop structure instead of poly-A tail 
(B) In animals, the introns in the primary messenger RNA for canonical histones are removed within the nucleus
(C) A mature messenger RNA may carry different combinations of exons from the original primary transcript
(D) Sometimes, the portion of RNA transcribed from an intron can cut itself out of the primary messenger RNA without the need for a spliceosome

Domain: Combinatorics

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
The statement "In animals, the introns in the primary messenger RNA for canonical histones are removed within the nucleus." is incorrect because canonical histones have been shown to be one of the few proteins in eukaryotes that are produced from genes without introns.
The other statements are all correct, there are portions of transcribed introns that splice themselves out of the primary transcript because they are ribozymes (RNA with enzymatic activity). Also alternative splicing is used to produce different combinations of exons producing different proteins from the same gene.
The mRNA for canonical histones does not have poly A tail and instead has a stem loop structure to protect it.

Answer: B
