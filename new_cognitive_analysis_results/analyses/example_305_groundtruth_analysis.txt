<explanation>The solver has comprehended the problem completely, as evidenced by arriving at the correct answer of 96. This indicates they understood the geometric relationships between the square ABCD, point P on diagonal AC, the circumcenters O₁ and O₂, and the goal of finding a+b where AP = √a + √b.</explanation>

<skill>Geometric Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to understand and apply properties of geometric shapes, spatial relationships, and geometric transformations to solve problems.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>96</end>
<text>96</text>
<explanation>The solver has successfully worked with complex geometric concepts including squares, diagonals, triangles, and circumcenters. They understood how these elements relate to each other in the given configuration, which is essential for solving this problem. The correct answer demonstrates their ability to reason about the geometric relationships between point P, the circumcenters O₁ and O₂, and the angle between them.</explanation>

<definition>The ability to work with symbolic representations, manipulate equations, and solve for unknown quantities using algebraic techniques.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>96</end>
<text>96</text>
<explanation>The solver has successfully manipulated algebraic expressions to determine that AP = √a + √b where a+b = 96. This indicates they performed algebraic operations to derive the relationship between the given angle of 120° and the position of point P on the diagonal, ultimately expressing AP in the required form.</explanation>

<skill>Coordinate Geometry</skill>
<definition>The ability to represent geometric problems using coordinate systems and solve them using algebraic methods.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>96</end>
<text>96</text>
<explanation>The solver likely used coordinate geometry to establish relationships between the various points in the problem. Since the problem involves a square with side length 12, they probably set up a coordinate system to represent the square and the point P on the diagonal, which would facilitate finding the circumcenters and calculating the angle between them.</explanation>

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify mathematical structures, regularities, or patterns that can simplify problem-solving.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>96</end>
<text>96</text>
<explanation>The solver recognized that the answer a+b = 96 has a specific pattern. They likely identified that a = 64 and b = 32 (or some other combination that sums to 96), which means AP = √64 + √32 = 8 + 4√2. This pattern recognition was crucial for expressing AP in the required form.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Problem Decomposition</skill>
<definition>The ability to break down a complex problem into simpler, more manageable sub-problems that can be solved independently.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>96</end>
<text>96</text>
<explanation>The solver decomposed this complex geometric problem into parts: first understanding the configuration of the square and point P, then determining the locations of the circumcenters, establishing the relationship with the 120° angle, and finally deriving the expression for AP in the required form. This systematic approach led to the correct answer of 96.</explanation>
