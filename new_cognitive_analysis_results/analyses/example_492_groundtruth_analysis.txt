Problem:
A molecule consists of three atoms with spin ½ each. The spin vector of the molecule can be written as $s = \sigma/2$, where $\sigma$ are Pauli matrices. The interaction Hamiltonian of the molecule is due to spin interactions and can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} = \frac{\lambda}{3} [ (\sigma_1 \cdot  \sigma_2) + (\sigma_2 \cdot \sigma_3) + (\sigma_3 \cdot \sigma_1)]
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ describes the strength of the interaction and $\sigma_{1,2,3}$ are Pauli spin matrices for individual atoms, which commute among themselves such that $\sigma_1^2 =\sigma_2^2= \sigma_3^2 = 1$ and the total spin of the molecule is 
\begin{equation}
	S = s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = \frac{1}{2} (\sigma_1 + \sigma_2 + \sigma_3)
\end{equation}
Every atom can have spin projections $\pm \frac{1}{2}$ for any choice of the quantization axis. The spin vectors have the properties
\begin{equation}
	S^2 = S(S+1),  s^2 = s(s+1)=\frac{3}{4}
\end{equation}

Which of the following is a correct description of the molecular states of the system?

Answer Choices:
(A) 2 quadruplets
(B) 4 doublets
(C) 1 quadruplet and 3 identical doublets 
(D) 1 quadruplet and 2 identical doublets

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Considering all possible combinations of atomic spin projections +/- ½, we have 3 atoms so there are $2^3 = 8$ possible combinations. Now we need to figure out the degeneracies using the Hamiltonian. 
Each atom can have its spin squared be $s^2 = s(s+1) = ¾$. Then the total spin operator can be written as 
\begin{equation}
S^2 = s_1^2 + s_2^2 + s_3^2 + 2(s_1 \cdot s_2 + s_2 \cdot s_3 + s_3 \cdot s_1) = 3 \times ¾ + ½ \times 2 \times \frac{3}{\lambda} H
\end{equation}
So the Hamiltonian can be expressed as $H = \frac{ \lambda}{4} (4S^2 – 9)$. So the total energy only depends on the total spin S. Looking at the possible combinations of the 3 atomic spins (additions of +/- ½) there are only 2 possible total spins: 3/2 and ½. So we have for 
S=3/2, 4 degenerate states with projections +/- 3/2, +/- ½, which is 1 quadruplet
S = ½, two identical doublets with projections +/- 1/2
