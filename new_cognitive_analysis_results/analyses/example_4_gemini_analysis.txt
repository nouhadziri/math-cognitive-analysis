Problem:
Two capacitors with capacitance values $C_{1}=2000 \pm 10 \mathrm{pF}$ and $C_{2}=3000 \pm 15 \mathrm{pF}$ are connected in series. The voltage applied across this combination is $V=5.00 \pm 0.02 \mathrm{~V}$. What is the percentage error in the calculation of the energy stored in this combination of capacitors?

Domain: Combinatorics

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be the capacitance values of the two capacitors, and $\Delta C_1$ and $\Delta C_2$ be their absolute errors.
Given:
$C_1 = 2000 \pm 10 \mathrm{pF}$
$C_2 = 3000 \pm 15 \mathrm{pF}$
Voltage applied across the combination, $V = 5.00 \pm 0.02 \mathrm{~V}$.

When capacitors are connected in series, the equivalent capacitance $C_{eq}$ is given by:
$\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}$
$C_{eq} = \frac{C_1 C_2}{C_1 + C_2}$

Calculate the nominal value of $C_{eq}$:
$C_{eq} = \frac{2000 \times 3000}{2000 + 3000} = \frac{6 \times 10^6}{5000} = 1200 \mathrm{pF}$

To find the error in $C_{eq}$, we use the formula for the error in a function of several variables. Let $f(C_1, C_2) = \frac{C_1 C_2}{C_1 + C_2}$.
$\Delta C_{eq} = \sqrt{(\frac{\partial C_{eq}}{\partial C_1} \Delta C_1)^2 + (\frac{\partial C_{eq}}{\partial C_2} \Delta C_2)^2}$ (This is for independent errors, which is the case here)

Calculate the partial derivatives:
$\frac{\partial C_{eq}}{\partial C_1} = \frac{(C_1 + C_2)C_2 - C_1 C_2}{(C_1 + C_2)^2} = \frac{C_2^2}{(C_1 + C_2)^2}$
$\frac{\partial C_{eq}}{\partial C_2} = \frac{(C_1 + C_2)C_1 - C_1 C_2}{(C_1 + C_2)^2} = \frac{C_1^2}{(C_1 + C_2)^2}$

Evaluate the partial derivatives at the nominal values:
$\frac{\partial C_{eq}}{\partial C_1} = \frac{(3000)^2}{(2000 + 3000)^2} = \frac{9 \times 10^6}{25 \times 10^6} = \frac{9}{25}$
$\frac{\partial C_{eq}}{\partial C_2} = \frac{(2000)^2}{(2000 + 3000)^2} = \frac{4 \times 10^6}{25 \times 10^6} = \frac{4}{25}$

Calculate the error in $C_{eq}$:
$\Delta C_{eq} = \sqrt{(\frac{9}{25} \times 10)^2 + (\frac{4}{25} \times 15)^2} = \sqrt{(\frac{90}{25})^2 + (\frac{60}{25})^2} = \sqrt{(\frac{1}{25})^2 (90^2 + 60^2)}$
$\Delta C_{eq} = \frac{1}{25} \sqrt{8100 + 3600} = \frac{1}{25} \sqrt{11700} = \frac{1}{25} \times 108.16 \approx 4.33 \mathrm{pF}$

Alternatively, we can use the formula for fractional error:
$\frac{\Delta C_{eq}}{C_{eq}^2} = \frac{\Delta C_1}{C_1^2} + \frac{\Delta C_2}{C_2^2}$ (This is wrong)

Let's use the logarithmic differentiation method for the equivalent capacitance.
$\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}$
$-\frac{1}{C_{eq}^2} dC_{eq} = -\frac{1}{C_1^2} dC_1 - \frac{1}{C_2^2} dC_2$
$\frac{dC_{eq}}{C_{eq}^2} = \frac{dC_1}{C_1^2} + \frac{dC_2}{C_2^2}$
$\frac{\Delta C_{eq}}{C_{eq}} = C_{eq} (\frac{\Delta C_1}{C_1^2} + \frac{\Delta C_2}{C_2^2}) = \frac{C_1 C_2}{C_1+C_2} (\frac{\Delta C_1}{C_1^2} + \frac{\Delta C_2}{C_2^2}) = \frac{C_2 \Delta C_1}{C_1(C_1+C_2)} + \frac{C_1 \Delta C_2}{C_2(C_1+C_2)}$
$\frac{\Delta C_{eq}}{C_{eq}} = \frac{3000 \times 10}{2000 \times 5000} + \frac{2000 \times 15}{3000 \times 5000} = \frac{30000}{10^7} + \frac{30000}{15 \times 10^6} = 0.003 + 0.002 = 0.005$
$\Delta C_{eq} = 0.005 \times 1200 = 6 \mathrm{pF}$

Energy stored in the combination of capacitors is given by:
$E = \frac{1}{2} C_{eq} V^2$

We need to find the percentage error in the calculation of the energy stored.
The fractional error in energy is given by:
$\frac{\Delta E}{E} = \frac{\Delta C_{eq}}{C_{eq}} + 2 \frac{\Delta V}{V}$

Given:
$\frac{\Delta C_1}{C_1} = \frac{10}{2000} = 0.005$
$\frac{\Delta C_2}{C_2} = \frac{15}{3000} = 0.005$
$\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \frac{0.02}{5.00} = 0.004$

Using the calculated $\frac{\Delta C_{eq}}{C_{eq}} = 0.005$:
$\frac{\Delta E}{E} = 0.005 + 2 \times 0.004 = 0.005 + 0.008 = 0.013$

Percentage error in energy = $\frac{\Delta E}{E} \times 100\% = 0.013 \times 100\% = 1.3\%$

Let's verify the error in $C_{eq}$ using another method.
Fractional error in $C_{eq}$:
$\frac{\Delta C_{eq}}{C_{eq}} = \frac{\Delta C_1}{C_1} \frac{C_2}{C_1+C_2} + \frac{\Delta C_2}{C_2} \frac{C_1}{C_1+C_2}$
$\frac{\Delta C_{eq}}{C_{eq}} = 0.005 \times \frac{3000}{5000} + 0.005 \times \frac{2000}{5000} = 0.005 \times (0.6 + 0.4) = 0.005 \times 1 = 0.005$

The formula for error propagation for $f = \frac{ab}{a+b}$:
$\frac{\Delta f}{f} = |\frac{\Delta a}{a} - \frac{\Delta a + \Delta b}{a+b}| + |\frac{\Delta b}{b} - \frac{\Delta a + \Delta b}{a+b}|$  (This is wrong)

We use the formula for the error in a function $f(x, y)$:
$\Delta f = |\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}| \Delta x + |\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}| \Delta y$

$\Delta C_{eq} = |\frac{C_2^2}{(C_1+C_2)^2}| \Delta C_1 + |\frac{C_1^2}{(C_1+C_2)^2}| \Delta C_2$
$\Delta C_{eq} = \frac{3000^2}{5000^2} \times 10 + \frac{2000^2}{5000^2} \times 15 = \frac{9}{25} \times 10 + \frac{4}{25} \times 15 = \frac{90}{25} + \frac{60}{25} = \frac{150}{25} = 6 \mathrm{pF}$

Fractional error in $C_{eq}$: $\frac{\Delta C_{eq}}{C_{eq}} = \frac{6}{1200} = 0.005$

Energy stored $E = \frac{1}{2} C_{eq} V^2$
Taking logarithm on both sides:
$\ln E = \ln(\frac{1}{2}) + \ln C_{eq} + 2 \ln V$
Differentiating:
$\frac{dE}{E} = 0 + \frac{dC_{eq}}{C_{eq}} + 2 \frac{dV}{V}$
Replacing differentials with errors:
$\frac{\Delta E}{E} = \frac{\Delta C_{eq}}{C_{eq}} + 2 \frac{\Delta V}{V}$

$\frac{\Delta E}{E} = 0.005 + 2 \times 0.004 = 0.005 + 0.008 = 0.013$

Percentage error in energy = $0.013 \times 100\% = 1.3\%$
