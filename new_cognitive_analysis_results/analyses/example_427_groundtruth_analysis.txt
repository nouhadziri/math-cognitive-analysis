Problem:
Consider the natural implementation of computing Fibonacci numbers:

\begin{tabular}{l}
1: \textbf{FUNCTION}  $\text{FIB}(n)$ : 
2: $\qquad$  \textbf{IF}  $n = 0$  \textbf{OR}  $n = 1$  \textbf{RETURN} 1 
3: $\qquad$  \textbf{RETURN}  $\text{FIB}(n-1) + \text{FIB}(n-2)$ \end{tabular}

When  $\text{FIB}(10)$  is evaluated, how many recursive calls to  $\text{FIB}$  occur?

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. Define \( c(n) \) as the number of recursive calls made by the function \(\text{FIB}(n)\).
2. Observe that for the base cases:
   \[
   c(0) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad c(1) = 0
   \]
   because no further recursive calls are made when \( n = 0 \) or \( n = 1 \).
3. For \( n \geq 2 \), the function \(\text{FIB}(n)\) makes two recursive calls: one to \(\text{FIB}(n-1)\) and one to \(\text{FIB}(n-2)\). Therefore, the number of recursive calls \( c(n) \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   c(n) = c(n-1) + c(n-2) + 2
   \]
   The "+2" accounts for the two recursive calls made by \(\text{FIB}(n)\) itself.
4. We need to compute \( c(10) \) using the recurrence relation. Start by calculating the values step-by-step:
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   c(2) &= c(1) + c(0) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, \\
   c(3) &= c(2) + c(1) + 2 = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4, \\
   c(4) &= c(3) + c(2) + 2 = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8, \\
   c(5) &= c(4) + c(3) + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14, \\
   c(6) &= c(5) + c(4) + 2 = 14 + 8 + 2 = 24, \\
   c(7) &= c(6) + c(5) + 2 = 24 + 14 + 2 = 40, \\
   c(8) &= c(7) + c(6) + 2 = 40 + 24 + 2 = 66, \\
   c(9) &= c(8) + c(7) + 2 = 66 + 40 + 2 = 108, \\
   c(10) &= c(9) + c(8) + 2 = 108 + 66 + 2 = 176.
   \end{aligned}
   \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{176}\).

   c(10) &= c(9) + c(8) + 2 = 108 + 66 + 2 = 176.

<explanation>The solver methodically applies the recurrence relation to calculate c(n) for increasingly larger values of n, building from the base cases up to n=10. Each step clearly shows the substitution of previously calculated values and the arithmetic operations performed. This demonstrates careful, organized computation that maintains accuracy throughout a lengthy calculation process.</explanation>
