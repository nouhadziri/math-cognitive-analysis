Domain: Differential equations

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the properties of a solution curve of a given differential equation that passes through a specific point. The differential equation is $\left(x^{2}+x y+4 x+2 y+4\right) \frac{d y}{d x}-y^{2}=0$, with $x>0$. The solution curve passes through $(1,3)$.

The differential equation can be rewritten as $\frac{d y}{d x} = \frac{y^{2}}{x^{2}+x y+4 x+2 y+4}$.

Let's try to factor the denominator:
$x^{2}+x y+4 x+2 y+4 = x(x+y+4) + 2(y+2)$
This doesn't seem to factor easily.

Consider the terms involving $x$ and $y$:
$x^{2}+x y+4 x+2 y+4 = x^2 + 4x + 4 + xy + 2y = (x+2)^2 + y(x+2) = (x+2)(x+2+y)$

So, the differential equation is $\frac{d y}{d x} = \frac{y^{2}}{(x+2)(x+y+2)}$.

This is a homogeneous-like equation if we consider shifts. Let $X = x+2$. Then $x = X-2$.
The equation becomes $\frac{d y}{d x} = \frac{y^{2}}{X(X+y)}$. Since $\frac{d y}{d x} = \frac{d y}{d X}$, we have:
$\frac{d y}{d X} = \frac{y^{2}}{X(X+y)}$

This is a homogeneous differential equation in terms of $X$ and $y$. Let $y = v X$, so $\frac{d y}{d X} = v + X \frac{d v}{d X}$.
$v + X \frac{d v}{d X} = \frac{(v X)^{2}}{X(X+v X)} = \frac{v^{2} X^{2}}{X^{2}(1+v)} = \frac{v^{2}}{1+v}$
$X \frac{d v}{d X} = \frac{v^{2}}{1+v} - v = \frac{v^{2} - v(1+v)}{1+v} = \frac{v^{2} - v - v^{2}}{1+v} = \frac{-v}{1+v}$

Separating variables:
$\frac{1+v}{-v} d v = \frac{1}{X} d X$
$-\left(\frac{1}{v} + 1\right) d v = \frac{1}{X} d X$
$-\int \left(\frac{1}{v} + 1\right) d v = \int \frac{1}{X} d X$
$-(\ln|v| + v) = \ln|X| + C$
$-\ln|v| - v = \ln|X| + C$
$\ln|v| + \ln|X| = -v - C$
$\ln|v X| = -v - C$

Substitute back $v = y/X = y/(x+2)$:
$\ln\left|\frac{y}{x+2} (x+2)\right| = -\frac{y}{x+2} - C$
$\ln|y| = -\frac{y}{x+2} - C$

The solution curve passes through $(1,3)$. Substitute $x=1, y=3$:
$\ln|3| = -\frac{3}{1+2} - C = -\frac{3}{3} - C = -1 - C$
$\ln 3 = -1 - C \implies C = -1 - \ln 3$

So, the equation of the solution curve is $\ln|y| = -\frac{y}{x+2} - (-1 - \ln 3) = 1 - \frac{y}{x+2} + \ln 3$.
$\ln|y| - \ln 3 = 1 - \frac{y}{x+2}$
$\ln\left|\frac{y}{3}\right| = 1 - \frac{y}{x+2}$

Since the curve passes through $(1,3)$ and $x>0$, we are considering the region where $y>0$.
$\ln\left(\frac{y}{3}\right) = 1 - \frac{y}{x+2}$

Now, let's check the intersection with the given curves.

(A) Intersection with $y=x+2$:
Substitute $y=x+2$ into the solution curve equation:
$\ln\left(\frac{x+2}{3}\right) = 1 - \frac{x+2}{x+2} = 1 - 1 = 0$
$\frac{x+2}{3} = e^{0} = 1$
$x+2 = 3 \implies x = 1$.
When $x=1$, $y = 1+2 = 3$. The intersection point is $(1,3)$, which is the point the curve passes through.
We need to check if there are other intersection points.
Consider the function $f(x) = \ln\left(\frac{x+2}{3}\right) - (1 - \frac{x+2}{x+2}) = \ln\left(\frac{x+2}{3}\right)$.
We are looking for solutions to $\ln\left(\frac{x+2}{3}\right) = 0$.
Since $\ln$ is a monotonic function, there is only one solution, which is $\frac{x+2}{3} = 1$, so $x=1$.
Thus, the solution curve intersects $y=x+2$ exactly at one point $(1,3)$.
Statement (A) is likely true.

(B) Intersection with $y=x+2$:
Since we found only one intersection point, statement (B) is false.

(C) Intersection with $y=(x+2)^{2}$:
Substitute $y=(x+2)^{2}$ into the solution curve equation:
$\ln\left(\frac{(x+2)^{2}}{3}\right) = 1 - \frac{(x+2)^{2}}{x+2} = 1 - (x+2) = 1 - x - 2 = -x - 1$
$\ln\left(\frac{(x+2)^{2}}{3}\right) = -x - 1$
$\ln((x+2)^{2}) - \ln 3 = -x - 1$
$2 \ln|x+2| - \ln 3 = -x - 1$
Since $x>0$, $x+2>0$, so $|x+2| = x+2$.
$2 \ln(x+2) = \ln 3 - x - 1$
Consider the function $g(x) = 2 \ln(x+2)$ and $h(x) = \ln 3 - x - 1$.
We are looking for the number of intersections between these two functions for $x>0$.

$g'(x) = \frac{2}{x+2}$
$h'(x) = -1$

At the intersection point, $2 \ln(x+2) = \ln 3 - x - 1$.
Let's evaluate the functions at $x=1$:
$g(1) = 2 \ln(1+2) = 2 \ln 3 = \ln 9$
$h(1) = \ln 3 - 1 - 1 = \ln 3 - 2$
$\ln 9 \approx 2.197$, $\ln 3 \approx 1.098$, $h(1) \approx 1.098 - 2 = -0.902$.
$g(1) > h(1)$.

As $x \to \infty$, $g(x) \to \infty$, $h(x) \to -\infty$.
As $x \to 0^+$, $g(x) \to 2 \ln 2 = \ln 4 \approx 1.386$.
$h(x) \to \ln 3 - 0 - 1 = \ln 3 - 1 \approx 1.098 - 1 = 0.098$.
$g(0) > h(0)$.

Consider the derivatives: $g'(x) = \frac{2}{x+2}$, $h'(x) = -1$.
For $x>0$, $x+2 > 2$, so $0 < \frac{1}{x+2} < \frac{1}{2}$, $0 < g'(x) < 1$.
$h'(x) = -1$.

Let $F(x) = g(x) - h(x) = 2 \ln(x+2) - (\ln 3 - x - 1) = 2 \ln(x+2) - \ln 3 + x + 1$.
We are looking for the number of zeros of $F(x)$ for $x>0$.
$F'(x) = \frac{2}{x+2} + 1 > 0$ for $x>0$.
So, $F(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x>0$.

Limit as $x \to 0^+$:
$F(0) = 2 \ln(2) - \ln 3 + 0 + 1 = \ln 4 - \ln 3 + 1 = \ln(4/3) + 1 > 0$ since $4/3 > 1$.

Limit as $x \to \infty$:
$F(x) \to \infty$.

Since $F(x)$ is strictly increasing and $F(0) > 0$, $F(x)$ has no zeros for $x>0$.
Therefore, the solution curve does NOT intersect $y=(x+2)^{2}$.
Statement (C) is false.

(D) Does NOT intersect $y=(x+3)^{2}$:
Substitute $y=(x+3)^{2}$ into the solution curve equation:
$\ln\left(\frac{(x+3)^{2}}{3}\right) = 1 - \frac{(x+3)^{2}}{x+2}$
$\ln((x+3)^{2}) - \ln 3 = 1 - \frac{(x+3)^{2}}{x+2}$
$2 \ln(x+3) - \ln 3 = 1 - \frac{(x+3)^{2}}{x+2}$
$2 \ln(x+3) - \ln 3 = \frac{x+2 - (x^2+6x+9)}{x+2} = \frac{x+2 - x^2 - 6x - 9}{x+2} = \frac{-x^2 - 5x - 7}{x+2}$
$2 \ln(x+3) = \ln 3 + \frac{-x^2 - 5x - 7}{x+2}$

Consider the functions $p(x) = 2 \ln(x+3)$ and $q(x) = \ln 3 + \frac{-x^2 - 5x - 7}{x+2}$.
We are looking for intersections for $x>0$.

Let's evaluate at $x=1$:
$p(1) = 2 \ln(1+3) = 2 \ln 4 = \ln 16 \approx 2.77$
$q(1) = \ln 3 + \frac{-1 - 5 - 7}{1+2} = \ln 3 + \frac{-13}{3} \approx 1.098 - 4.33 = -3.232$
$p(1) > q(1)$.

As $x \to \infty$:
$p(x) \to \infty$.
$q(x) = \ln 3 + \frac{-x^2(1 + 5/x + 7/x^2)}{x(1+2/x)} \approx \ln 3 - x \to -\infty$.

Consider the derivatives:
$p'(x) = \frac{2}{x+3}$
$q'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \ln 3 + \frac{-x^2 - 5x - 7}{x+2} \right) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{-x^2 - 5x - 7}{x+2} \right)$
Using the quotient rule: $\frac{(-2x-5)(x+2) - (-x^2-5x-7)(1)}{(x+2)^2}$
Numerator: $(-2x^2 - 4x - 5x - 10) - (-x^2 - 5x - 7) = -2x^2 - 9x - 10 + x^2 + 5x + 7 = -x^2 - 4x - 3 = -(x^2+4x+3) = -(x+1)(x+3)$
$q'(x) = \frac{-(x+1)(x+3)}{(x+2)^2}$

For $x>0$, $p'(x) > 0$.
For $x>0$, $q'(x) < 0$.

Let $R(x) = p(x) - q(x) = 2 \ln(x+3) - \ln 3 - \frac{-x^2 - 5x - 7}{x+2}$.
We are looking for the number of zeros of $R(x)$ for $x>0$.
$R'(x) = p'(x) - q'(x) = \frac{2}{x+3} - \frac{-(x+1)(x+3)}{(x+2)^2} = \frac{2}{x+3} + \frac{(x+1)(x+3)}{(x+2)^2}$
For $x>0$, $R'(x) > 0$, so $R(x)$ is strictly increasing.

Limit as $x \to 0^+$:
$R(0) = 2 \ln(3) - \ln 3 - \frac{-7}{2} = \ln 3 + \frac{7}{2} > 0$.

Limit as $x \to \infty$:
$R(x) \to \infty - (-\infty) = \infty$.

Since $R(x)$ is strictly increasing and $R(0) > 0$, $R(x)$ has no zeros for $x>0$.
Therefore, the solution curve does NOT intersect $y=(x+3)^{2}$.
Statement (D) is true.

Summary of findings:
(A) intersects $y=x+2$ exactly at one point - TRUE
(B) intersects $y=x+2$ exactly at two points - FALSE
(C) intersects $y=(x+2)^{2}$ - FALSE
(D) does NOT intersect $y=(x+3)^{2}$ - TRUE

Let's double-check the algebra.

The solution to the differential equation is $\ln\left(\frac{y}{3}\right) = 1 - \frac{y}{x+2}$.

Intersection with $y=x+2$:
$\ln\left(\frac{x+2}{3}\right) = 1 - \frac{x+2}{x+2} = 0$
$\frac{x+2}{3} = 1 \implies x=1$.
Intersection point $(1,3)$.

Intersection with $y=(x+2)^2$:
$\ln\left(\frac{(x+2)^2}{3}\right) = 1 - \frac{(x+2)^2}{x+2} = 1 - (x+2) = -x - 1$
$2 \ln(x+2) - \ln 3 = -x - 1$
$2 \ln(x+2) + x + 1 - \ln 3 = 0$
Let $F(x) = 2 \ln(x+2) + x + 1 - \ln 3$.
$F'(x) = \frac{2}{x+2} + 1 > 0$ for $x>0$.
$F(0) = 2 \ln 2 + 1 - \ln 3 = \ln 4 + 1 - \ln 3 = 1 + \ln(4/3) > 0$.
Since $F(x)$ is increasing and $F(0)>0$, $F(x)$ has no zeros for $x>0$.

Intersection with $y=(x+3)^2$:
$\ln\left(\frac{(x+3)^2}{3}\right) = 1 - \frac{(x+3)^2}{x+2}$
$2 \ln(x+3) - \ln 3 = 1 - \frac{(x+3)^2}{x+2}$
$2 \ln(x+3) - \ln 3 = \frac{x+2 - (x^2+6x+9)}{x+2} = \frac{-x^2 - 5x - 7}{x+2}$
$2 \ln(x+3) - \ln 3 - \frac{-x^2 - 5x - 7}{x+2} = 0$
Let $R(x) = 2 \ln(x+3) - \ln 3 + \frac{x^2 + 5x + 7}{x+2}$.
$R'(x) = \frac{2}{x+3} + \frac{(2x+5)(x+2) - (x^2+5x+7)(1)}{(x+2)^2}$
Numerator: $(2x^2+4x+5x+10) - (x^2+5x+7) = 2x^2+9x+10 - x^2-5x-7 = x^2+4x+3 = (x+1)(x+3)$
$R'(x) = \frac{2}{x+3} + \frac{(x+1)(x+3)}{(x+2)^2} > 0$ for $x>0$.

Limit as $x \to 0^+$:
$R(0) = 2 \ln 3 - \ln 3 + \frac{7}{2} = \ln 3 + \frac{7}{2} > 0$.
Since $R(x)$ is increasing and $R(0)>0$, $R(x)$ has no zeros for $x>0$.

The solution curve intersects $y=x+2$ at $(1,3)$.
To confirm uniqueness, consider the equation $\ln\left(\frac{x+2}{3}\right) = 0$, which has only one solution $x=1$.
