Problem:
Let $f:[0,1] \rightarrow[0,1]$ be the function defined by $f(x)=\frac{x^{3}}{3}-x^{2}+\frac{5}{9} x+\frac{17}{36}$. Consider the square region $S=[0,1] \times[0,1]$. Let $G=\{(x, y) \in S: y>f(x)\}$ be called the green region and $R=\{(x, y) \in S: y<f(x)\}$ be called the red region. Let $L_{h}=\{(x, h) \in S: x \in[0,1]\}$ be the horizontal line drawn at a height $h \in[0,1]$. Then which of the following statements is(are) true?



(A) There exists an $h \in\left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{2}{3}\right]$ such that the area of the green region above the line $L_{h}$ equals the area of the green region below the line $L_{h}$



(B) There exists an $h \in\left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{2}{3}\right]$ such that the area of the red region above the line $L_{h}$ equals the area of the red region below the line $L_{h}$



(C) There exists an $h \in\left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{2}{3}\right]$ such that the area of the green region above the line $L_{h}$ equals the area of the red region below the line $L_{h}$



(D) There exists an $h \in\left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{2}{3}\right]$ such that the area of the red region above the line $L_{h}$ equals the area of the green region below the line $L_{h}$
