Problem:
Let $A$ be a $2n \times 2n$ matrix, with entries chosen independently at random. Every entry is chosen to be 0 or 1, each with probability $1/2$. Find the expected value of $\det(A-A^t)$ (as a function of $n$), where $A^t$ is the transpose of $A$.

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
The expected value equals \[ \frac{(2n)!}{4^n n!}. \] Write the determinant of $A-A^t$ as the sum over permutations $\sigma$ of $\{1,\dots,2n\}$ of the product \[ \sgn(\sigma) \prod_{i=1}^{2n} (A-A^t)_{i \sigma(i)} = \sgn(\sigma) \prod_{i=1}^{2n} (A_{i \sigma(i)} - A_{\sigma(i) i}); \] then the expected value of the determinant is the sum over $\sigma$ of the expected value of this product, which we denote by $E_\sigma$. Note that if we partition $\{1,\dots,2n\}$ into orbits for the action of $\sigma$, then partition the factors of the product accordingly, then no entry of $A$ appears in more than one of these factors; consequently, these factors are independent random variables. This means that we can compute $E_\sigma$ as the product of the expected values of the individual factors. It is obvious that any orbit of size 1 gives rise to the zero product, and hence the expected value of the corresponding factor is zero. For an orbit of size $m \geq 3$, the corresponding factor contains $2m$ distinct matrix entries, so again we may compute the expected value of the factor as the product of the expected values of the individual terms $A_{i \sigma(i)} - A_{\sigma(i) i}$. However, the distribution of this term is symmetric about 0, so its expected value is 0. We conclude that $E_\sigma = 0$ unless $\sigma$ acts with $n$ orbits of size 2. To compute $E_\sigma$ in this case, assume without loss of generality that the orbits of $\sigma$ are $\{1,2\}, \dots, \{2n-1,2n\}$; note that $\sgn(\sigma) = (-1)^n$. Then $E_\sigma$ is the expected value of $\prod_{i=1}^n -(A_{(2i-1)2i} - A_{2i(2i-1)})^2$, which is $(-1)^n$ times the $n$-th power of the expected value of $(A_{12} - A_{21})^2$. Since $A_{12} - A_{21}$ takes the values $-1, 0, 1$ with probabilities $\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}$, its square takes the values $0,1$ with probabilities $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}$; we conclude that \[ E_\sigma = 2^{-n}. \] The permutations $\sigma$ of this form correspond to unordered partitions of $\{1,\dots,2n\}$ into $n$ sets of size 2, so there are \[ \frac{(2n)!}{n!(2!)^n} \] such permutations. Putting this all together yields the claimed result.
