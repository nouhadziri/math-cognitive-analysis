Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the number of $1$ by $1$ graph paper squares whose interiors lie entirely below the line $9x+223y=2007$ and entirely in the first quadrant.

The first quadrant is defined by $x > 0$ and $y > 0$.
The graph paper squares have vertices at integer coordinates. A square with bottom-left corner at $(i, j)$ has its interior defined by $i < x < i+1$ and $j < y < j+1$.

The interior of such a square lies entirely below the line $9x+223y=2007$ if the top-right corner of the square $(i+1, j+1)$ satisfies the inequality $9(i+1)+223(j+1) \le 2007$. This is because if the top-right corner is below or on the line, then the entire interior of the square is below the line due to the monotonicity of the line.

The interior of the square also lies entirely in the first quadrant if $i \ge 0$ and $j \ge 0$. Since the bottom-left corner is $(i, j)$, for the interior to be in the first quadrant, we need $i \ge 0$ and $j \ge 0$. If $i=0$, then $0 < x < 1$, which is in the first quadrant. Similarly for $y$.

The condition for the interior of the square to be below the line is:
$9(i+1)+223(j+1) \le 2007$
$9i+9+223j+223 \le 2007$
$9i+223j+232 \le 2007$
$9i+223j \le 2007 - 232$
$9i+223j \le 1775$

We are looking for the number of pairs of integers $(i, j)$ such that $i \ge 0$, $j \ge 0$, and $9i+223j \le 1775$.
The squares are in the first quadrant, so $i \ge 0$ and $j \ge 0$. The bottom-left corner of the squares are at $(i, j)$.

The question implies that the interior of the square is strictly below the line.
The condition that the interior of the square lies entirely below the graph means that for any point $(x, y)$ in the interior of the square, $9x+223y < 2007$.
The interior of the square with bottom-left corner $(i, j)$ is $(i < x < i+1, j < y < j+1)$.
The supremum of $9x+223y$ over the interior of the square occurs at the top-right corner $(i+1, j+1)$.
So, the condition is $9(i+1)+223(j+1) < 2007$.
$9i+9+223j+223 < 2007$
$9i+223j+232 < 2007$
$9i+223j < 2007 - 232$
$9i+223j < 1775$

We need to find the number of pairs of non-negative integers $(i, j)$ such that $9i+223j < 1775$.

Consider the constraints on $j$. Since $i \ge 0$, we have $223j < 1775$.
$j < \frac{1775}{223} \approx 7.959$
So, possible values of $j$ are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.

Case 1: $j=0$
$9i < 1775$
$i < \frac{1775}{9} \approx 197.22$
Possible values of $i$: $0, 1, ..., 197$. Number of values = $197 - 0 + 1 = 198$.

Case 2: $j=1$
$9i + 223 < 1775$
$9i < 1775 - 223 = 1552$
$i < \frac{1552}{9} \approx 172.44$
Possible values of $i$: $0, 1, ..., 172$. Number of values = $172 - 0 + 1 = 173$.

Case 3: $j=2$
$9i + 223 \times 2 < 1775$
$9i + 446 < 1775$
$9i < 1775 - 446 = 1329$
$i < \frac{1329}{9} = 147.66$
Possible values of $i$: $0, 1, ..., 147$. Number of values = $147 - 0 + 1 = 148$.

Case 4: $j=3$
$9i + 223 \times 3 < 1775$
$9i + 669 < 1775$
$9i < 1775 - 669 = 1106$
$i < \frac{1106}{9} = 122.88$
Possible values of $i$: $0, 1, ..., 122. Number of values = $122 - 0 + 1 = 123$.

Case 5: $j=4$
$9i + 223 \times 4 < 1775$
$9i + 892 < 1775$
$9i < 1775 - 892 = 883$
$i < \frac{883}{9} = 98.11$
Possible values of $i$: $0, 1, ..., 98$. Number of values = $98 - 0 + 1 = 99$.

Case 6: $j=5$
$9i + 223 \times 5 < 1775$
$9i + 1115 < 1775$
$9i < 1775 - 1115 = 660$
$i < \frac{660}{9} = 73.33$
Possible values of $i$: $0, 1, ..., 73$. Number of values = $73 - 0 + 1 = 74$.

Case 7: $j=6$
$9i + 223 \times 6 < 1775$
$9i + 1338 < 1775$
$9i < 1775 - 1338 = 437$
$i < \frac{437}{9} = 48.55$
Possible values of $i$: $0, 1, ..., 48$. Number of values = $48 - 0 + 1 = 49$.

Case 8: $j=7$
$9i + 223 \times 7 < 1775$
$9i + 1561 < 1775$
$9i < 1775 - 1561 = 214$
$i < \frac{214}{9} = 23.77$
Possible values of $i$: $0, 1, ..., 23$. Number of values = $23 - 0 + 1 = 24$.

Total number of squares = $198 + 173 + 148 + 123 + 99 + 74 + 49 + 24$.
Sum = $(200-2) + (175-2) + (150-2) + (125-2) + (100-1) + (75-1) + (50-1) + (25-1)$
Sum = $198 + 173 + 148 + 123 + 99 + 74 + 49 + 24 = 888$.

Let's double check the calculations.
The number of possible values of $i$ for a given $j$ is $\lfloor \frac{1775 - 223j - 1}{9} \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor \frac{1774 - 223j}{9} \rfloor + 1$.
Alternatively, since $i \ge 0$, the number of values of $i$ is $\lfloor \frac{1775 - 223j}{9} \rfloor$. Let's be careful with strict inequality.

The condition is $9i < 1775 - 223j$.
$i \le \lfloor \frac{1775 - 223j - \epsilon}{9} \rfloor$, where $\epsilon$ is a small positive number.
If $1775 - 223j$ is not a multiple of 9, then $i \le \lfloor \frac{1775 - 223j - 1}{9} \rfloor$.
The number of non-negative integers $i$ satisfying this is $\lfloor \frac{1775 - 223j - 1}{9} \rfloor + 1$.

Let's use the bounds directly.
For a fixed $j$, we have $0 \le i < \frac{1775 - 223j}{9}$.
The number of integer values of $i$ is $\lfloor \frac{1775 - 223j}{9} \rfloor$.

Example: $j=0$, $0 \le i < \frac{1775}{9} = 197.22$. Values of $i$: $0, 1, ..., 197$. Number = 198.
$\lfloor 197.22 \rfloor = 197$. This doesn't match.

Let's reconsider the condition $9i < 1775 - 223j$.
If $1775 - 223j > 0$, then $i$ can range from $0$ to $\lfloor \frac{1775 - 223j - \delta}{9} \rfloor$, where $\delta$ is infinitesimally small.
The largest integer $i$ is such that $i \le \frac{1775 - 223j}{9} - \epsilon$.

Consider the line $9x+223y=1775$ in the $ij$-plane. We are looking for the number of integer points $(i, j)$ in the region $i \ge 0, j \ge 0, 9i+223j < 1775$.

The squares are indexed by their bottom-left corner $(i, j)$, where $i, j$ are non-negative integers.

Let's use Pick's Theorem? No, that applies to areas and boundary points.

Consider the intercepts of the line $9x+223y=2007$.
When $y=0$, $9x = 2007$, $x = \frac{2007}{9} = 223$.
When $x=0$, $223y = 2007$, $y = \frac{2007}{223} = 9$.

The line passes through $(223, 0)$ and $(0, 9)$.

The condition for the interior of the square with bottom-left corner $(i, j)$ to be below the line is $9(i+1)+223(j+1) < 2007$.

Consider the graph paper squares in the first quadrant. The bottom-left corners are $(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), ...$.
The squares have interiors $(i < x < i+1, j < y < j+1)$ for $i \ge 0, j \ge 0$.

We need the number of pairs of non-negative integers $(i, j)$ such that the interior of the square with bottom-left corner $(i, j)$ is below the line.

The top-right corner of the square is $(i+1, j+1)$.
The condition is $9(i+1)+223(j+1) < 2007$.

Consider the line $9x+223y = 1775$ in the $ij$-plane. We need the number of integer points $(i, j)$ in the first quadrant that lie strictly below this line.

The region is $i \ge 0, j \ge 0, 9i+223j < 1775$.

When $j=0$, $9i < 1775$, $i < 197.22$. Integer values of $i$: $0, 1, ..., 197$. (198 values).
When $i=0$, $223j < 1775$, $j < 7.959$. Integer values of $j$: $0, 1, ..., 7$. (8 values).

Let's verify the calculations for the number of $i$ values.
For a fixed $j$, the inequality is $9i < 1775 - 223j$.
Since $i \ge 0$, we need $1775 - 223j > 0$, so $j \le 7$.

If $j=0$, $9i < 1775$, $i \le 197$. Number of values = 198.
If $j=1$, $9i < 1552$, $i \le 172$. Number of values = 173.
If $j=2, 9i < 1329, i \le 147$. Number of values = 148.
If $j=3, 9i < 1106, i \le 122$. Number of values = 123.
If $j=4, 9i < 883, i \le 98$. Number of values = 99.
If $j=5, 9i < 660, i \le 73$. Number of values = 74.
If $j=6, 9i < 437, i \le 48$. Number of values = 49.
If $j=7, 9i < 214, i \le 23$. Number of values = 24.

The total number of squares is the sum of the number of possible values of $i$ for each $j$.
Total = $198 + 173 + 148 + 123 + 99 + 74 + 49 + 24 = 888$.

Let's think about the geometry of the problem.
The line $9x+223y=2007$ intersects the axes at $(223, 0)$ and $(0, 9)$.

Consider the region in the first quadrant below the line.
We are counting the number of grid squares whose interiors are entirely within this region.

The squares have bottom-left corners at integer coordinates $(i, j)$, $i \ge 0, j \ge 0$.
The top-right corner is $(i+1, j+1)$.
For the interior to be below the line, the top-right corner must be below or on the line $9x+223y = 2007 - \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is infinitesimal.

Consider the transformation $u = x-0.5, v = y-0.5$. The center of the square is at $(i+0.5, j+0.5)$.
The condition is that the entire square is below the line.

Let's check the interpretation of "interiors lying entirely below the graph".
For a point $(x, y)$ in the interior of the square, $9x+223y < 2007$.
The supremum of $9x+223y$ over the interior of the square occurs at the top-right corner $(i+1, j+1)$.
So, we need $9(i+1)+223(j+1) \le 2007$.

If the inequality was strict, $9(i+1)+223(j+1) < 2007$.

The wording "interiors lying entirely below the graph" implies strict inequality.

Let the graph be the set of points $(x, y)$ such that $9x+223y=2007$.
The region below the graph is $9x+223y < 2007$.
The interior of the square is $i < x < i+1, j < y < j+1$.
We need $9x+223y < 2007$ for all $x \in (i, i+1), y \in (j, j+1)$.
This is equivalent to $\sup_{x \in (i, i+1), y \in (j, j+1)} (9x+223y) \le 2007$.

Since the function is increasing in $x$ and $y$, the supremum occurs as $x \to i+1$ and $y \to j+1$.
So, $9(i+1) + 223(j+1) \le 2007$.

If "entirely below" means strictly below, then $9x+223y < 2007$.
Then the condition is $9(i+1)+223(j+1) < 2007$, which we used.

The squares are in the first quadrant, so $i \ge 0$ and $j \ge 0$.

Consider the edge cases.
If a square touches the line, its interior does not lie entirely below the graph.

Let's imagine the line and the grid.
The squares are formed by the grid lines $x=k, y=l$ for integers $k, l$.

The squares in the first quadrant have bottom-left corners $(i, j)$ with $i \ge 0, j \ge 0$.
The square with bottom-left $(i, j)$ has vertices $(i, j), (i+1, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j+1)$.

The condition for the interior to be below the line is that the top-right corner is on or below the line.

Let's consider a square whose top-right corner lies on the line: $9(i+1)+223(j+1) = 2007$.
$9i+9+223j+223 = 2007$
$9i+223j = 1775$.

We are counting the number of squares whose bottom-left corner $(i, j)$ satisfies $i \ge 0, j \ge 0$ and $9(i+1)+223(j+1) < 2007$.

The number of integer points $(i, j)$ with $i \ge 0, j \ge 0$ satisfying $9i+223j < 1775$.

Consider the line $9i+223j = 1775$ in the $ij$-plane.
We are counting the number of lattice points in the first quadrant strictly below this line.

The intercepts of the line are $(\frac{1775}{9}, 0) \approx (197.22, 0)$ and $(0, \frac{1775}{223}) \approx (0, 7.959)$.

The integer points on the axes below the intercepts are $(0, 0), ..., (197, 0)$ and $(0, 0), ..., (0, 7)$.

If the question asked for squares whose interiors intersect the region below the graph, it would be different.

The number of squares is the number of pairs of integers $(i, j)$ such that the square with bottom-left $(i, j)$ satisfies the conditions.

Final check of calculations.
The sum of an arithmetic progression: $a, a+d, ..., a+(n-1)d$. Sum = $\frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d)$.

The number of values of $i$ for a given $j$ is $\lfloor \frac{1775 - 223j - 1}{9} \rfloor + 1$.

Let's use the strict inequality.
$9i+223j < 1775$.
Consider the line $9x+223y = 1775$.

We need the number of lattice points $(i, j)$ with $i \ge 0, j \ge 0$ strictly below the line.

When $j=0$, $9i < 1775$, $i \le 197$. Values $0, ..., 197$. (198 values).
When $j=1$, $9i < 1552$, $i \le 172$. Values $0, ..., 172$. (173 values).
...

The calculation seems correct based on the interpretation of the problem.

Total = $198 + 173 + 148 + 123 + 99 + 74 + 49 + 24 = 888$.</text>
<explanation>After recalculating each case, the solver verifies the final sum, demonstrating thoroughness in checking their work.</explanation>

<text>Let's use Pick's Theorem? No, that applies to areas and boundary points.</text>
<explanation>The solver considers using Pick's Theorem as a potential approach but correctly recognizes it's not applicable to this problem, showing strategic thinking in method selection.</explanation>

<text>Consider the intercepts of the line $9x+223y=2007$.
When $y=0$, $9x = 2007$, $x = \frac{2007}{9} = 223$.
When $x=0$, $223y = 2007$, $y = \frac{2007}{223} = 9$.</text>
<explanation>After rejecting Pick's Theorem, the solver shifts to analyzing the intercepts of the line, showing flexibility in trying different approaches to gain insight into the problem.</explanation>

<start>6150</start>
<end>6374</end>
<text>Let's think about the geometry of the problem.
The line $9x+223y=2007$ intersects the axes at $(223, 0)$ and $(0, 9)$.

Consider the region in the first quadrant below the line.
We are counting the number of grid squares whose interiors are entirely within this region.</text>
<explanation>The solver steps back to consider the geometric interpretation of the problem, showing strategic thinking in approaching the problem from different angles.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to make logical deductions and inferences based on mathematical principles and properties.</definition>

<start>723</start>
<end>1023</end>
<text>The interior of the square also lies entirely in the first quadrant if $i \ge 0$ and $j \ge 0$. Since the bottom-left corner is $(i, j)$, for the interior to be in the first quadrant, we need $i \ge 0$ and $j \ge 0$. If $i=0$, then $0 < x < 1$, which is in the first quadrant. Similarly for $y$.</text>
<explanation>The solver reasons about the conditions for a square to be in the first quadrant, making logical deductions about the relationship between the coordinates of the bottom-left corner and the position of the square.</explanation>

<start>1911</start>
<end>2041</end>
<text>The supremum of $9x+223y$ over the interior of the square occurs at the top-right corner $(i+1, j+1)$.
So, the condition is $9(i+1)+223(j+1) < 2007$.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses mathematical reasoning to determine that the maximum value of the linear function over the square occurs at the top-right corner, which is a key insight for solving the problem.</explanation>

<start>6627</start>
<end>6895</end>
<text>So, $9(i+1) + 223(j+1) \le 2007$.

If "entirely below" means strictly below, then $9x+223y < 2007$.
Then the condition is $9(i+1)+223(j+1) < 2007$, which we used.

The squares are in the first quadrant, so $i \ge 0$ and $j \ge 0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver carefully reasons about the interpretation of "entirely below," making a logical distinction between "≤" and "<" and determining which is appropriate for the problem at hand.</explanation>

SUMMARY_START
The most important cognitive skills demonstrated in this mathematical problem-solving trajectory are:

1. Problem Interpretation - The solver carefully interprets what it means for squares to be "entirely below" the graph and "entirely in the first quadrant," which is crucial for setting up the correct mathematical conditions.

2. Mathematical Modeling - The solver effectively translates the verbal description into precise mathematical notation, defining squares by their coordinates and expressing the condition of being below the line as an inequality.

3. Case Analysis - The solver methodically breaks down the problem by considering each possible value of j separately, which provides a systematic approach to counting the squares.

4. Self-Monitoring and Verification - Throughout the solution, the solver repeatedly checks their work, verifies calculations, and reconsiders interpretations to ensure correctness.

5. Algebraic Manipulation - The solver skillfully transforms and simplifies the key inequality (9(i+1)+223(j+1) < 2007) to create a more manageable form (9i+223j < 1775) for solving the problem.
