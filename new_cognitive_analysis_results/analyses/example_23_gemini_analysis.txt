Problem:
Imagine a radioactive nuclei X(Z,A) can decay into Y(Z-2, A-4) by emitting an alpha particle with partial half life 3.0 minutes. X(Z,A) can also decay into Q(Z+1,A) by decaying a $\beta^-$ with partial half life 0.098 minutes. If the initial number of X nuclei were 5*10^34 then what is the activity of $\alpha$ decay after 10 minutes? Note, here Z is proton number and A is mass number. 

Answer Choices:
(A) 1.911*10^31 Bq
(B) 3.719 Bq
(C) 113.837 Bq
(D) 117.555 Bq

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
The parent nuclei is X(Z,A).
It can decay into Y(Z-2, A-4) by emitting an alpha particle. The partial half life for this decay is $T_{\alpha} = 3.0$ minutes.
It can also decay into Q(Z+1,A) by emitting a $\beta^-$ particle. The partial half life for this decay is $T_{\beta} = 0.098$ minutes.
The initial number of X nuclei is $N_0 = 5 \times 10^{34}$.
We need to find the activity of $\alpha$ decay after 10 minutes.

The decay constant for $\alpha$ decay is $\lambda_{\alpha} = \frac{\ln 2}{T_{\alpha}} = \frac{0.693}{3.0}$ min$^{-1}$.
The decay constant for $\beta^-$ decay is $\lambda_{\beta} = \frac{\ln 2}{T_{\beta}} = \frac{0.693}{0.098}$ min$^{-1}$.

The number of nuclei X at time t is given by $N(t) = N_0 e^{-(\lambda_{\alpha} + \lambda_{\beta})t}$.
The activity of $\alpha$ decay is given by $A_{\alpha}(t) = \lambda_{\alpha} N(t)$.

Calculate $\lambda_{\alpha}$:
$\lambda_{\alpha} = \frac{0.693}{3.0} = 0.231$ min$^{-1}$.

Calculate $\lambda_{\beta}$:
$\lambda_{\beta} = \frac{0.693}{0.098} \approx 7.071$ min$^{-1}$.

Calculate the total decay constant $\lambda = \lambda_{\alpha} + \lambda_{\beta}$:
$\lambda = 0.231 + 7.071 = 7.302$ min$^{-1}$.

Calculate the number of nuclei X after 10 minutes:
$N(10) = N_0 e^{-\lambda \times 10} = 5 \times 10^{34} e^{-7.302 \times 10} = 5 \times 10^{34} e^{-73.02}$.

Calculate the activity of $\alpha$ decay after 10 minutes:
$A_{\alpha}(10) = \lambda_{\alpha} N(10) = 0.231 \times 5 \times 10^{34} e^{-73.02}$.

We need to evaluate $e^{-73.02}$.
$e^{-73.02}$ is a very small number.
Let's check the calculations again.

The number of nuclei X at time t is given by $N(t) = N_0 e^{-(\lambda_{\alpha} + \lambda_{\beta})t}$.
The rate of $\alpha$ decay is given by $R_{\alpha}(t) = \lambda_{\alpha} N(t) = \lambda_{\alpha} N_0 e^{-(\lambda_{\alpha} + \lambda_{\beta})t}$.

Convert the time to seconds as the activity is in Becquerel (Bq), which is decays per second.
$T_{\alpha} = 3.0 \times 60 = 180$ seconds.
$T_{\beta} = 0.098 \times 60 = 5.88$ seconds.
$t = 10 \times 60 = 600$ seconds.

$\lambda_{\alpha} = \frac{\ln 2}{180} = \frac{0.693}{180} \approx 0.00385$ s$^{-1}$.
$\lambda_{\beta} = \frac{\ln 2}{5.88} = \frac{0.693}{5.88} \approx 0.11786$ s$^{-1}$.

$\lambda = \lambda_{\alpha} + \lambda_{\beta} = 0.00385 + 0.11786 = 0.12171$ s$^{-1}$.

$R_{\alpha}(t) = \lambda_{\alpha} N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$.
$R_{\alpha}(600) = 0.00385 \times 5 \times 10^{34} e^{-0.12171 \times 600}$.
$R_{\alpha}(600) = 0.01925 \times 10^{34} e^{-73.026}$.

We know $e^{-73.026}$ is a very small number. This suggests there might be an issue with the question or the answer choices. Let's re-examine the question. The question asks for the activity of $\alpha$ decay, which is the rate of $\alpha$ decay at that time.

Let's check the calculations again without converting to seconds first and convert the final answer.
$\lambda_{\alpha} = 0.231$ min$^{-1}$.
$\lambda_{\beta} = 7.071$ min$^{-1}$.
$t = 10$ minutes.

$N(10) = 5 \times 10^{34} e^{-(0.231+7.071) \times 10} = 5 \times 10^{34} e^{-73.02}$.
Activity of $\alpha$ decay $A_{\alpha}(10) = \lambda_{\alpha} N(10) = 0.231 \times 5 \times 10^{34} e^{-73.02}$.
$A_{\alpha}(10) = 1.155 \times 10^{34} e^{-73.02}$ min$^{-1}$.

Convert to Becquerel (Bq):
$A_{\alpha}(10) = 1.155 \times 10^{34} e^{-73.02} / 60$ Bq.

Let's consider the possibility that the number of X nuclei remains roughly constant because the time is relatively short compared to the alpha decay half-life. However, the beta decay has a very short half-life.

Let's think step by step.
1. Calculate the decay constants for both alpha and beta decay.
2. Calculate the number of remaining X nuclei after 10 minutes considering both decays.
3. Calculate the activity of alpha decay using the number of remaining X nuclei and the alpha decay constant.

Rethink the approach: The rate of alpha decay depends on the number of X nuclei present at that time. The number of X nuclei decreases due to both alpha and beta decays.

The number of nuclei X at time t is $N(t) = N_0 e^{-(\lambda_{\alpha} + \lambda_{\beta})t}$.
The activity of $\alpha$ decay at time t is $A_{\alpha}(t) = \lambda_{\alpha} N(t) = \lambda_{\alpha} N_0 e^{-(\lambda_{\alpha} + \lambda_{\beta})t}$.

Using minutes:
$\lambda_{\alpha} = 0.231$ min$^{-1}$.
$\lambda_{\beta} = 7.071$ min$^{-1}$.
$N_0 = 5 \times 10^{34}$.
$t = 10$ minutes.

$A_{\alpha}(10) = 0.231 \times 5 \times 10^{34} \times e^{-(0.231+7.071) \times 10}$
$A_{\alpha}(10) = 1.155 \times 10^{34} \times e^{-73.02}$ min$^{-1}$.

To convert to Bq, divide by 60:
$A_{\alpha}(10) = \frac{1.155 \times 10^{34} \times e^{-73.02}}{60}$ Bq.

Calculate $e^{-73.02}$:
Using a calculator, $e^{-73.02} \approx 5.12 \times 10^{-32}$.

$A_{\alpha}(10) = \frac{1.155 \times 10^{34} \times 5.12 \times 10^{-32}}{60}$
$A_{\alpha}(10) = \frac{1.155 \times 5.12 \times 10^{2}}{60}$
$A_{\alpha}(10) = \frac{5.9136 \times 100}{60}$
$A_{\alpha}(10) = \frac{591.36}{60}$
$A_{\alpha}(10) \approx 9.856$ Bq.

This is not matching any of the answer choices. Let's check if there is any mistake in the understanding or calculation.

Re-read the question carefully: "activity of $\alpha$ decay after 10 minutes". This means the rate of alpha decay at t=10 minutes.

Let's re-calculate with high precision.
$\lambda_{\alpha} = \ln(2) / 3.0 \approx 0.69314718 / 3.0 \approx 0.23104906$ min$^{-1}$.
$\lambda_{\beta} = \ln(2) / 0.098 \approx 0.69314718 / 0.098 \approx 7.0729304$ min$^{-1}$.
$\lambda = \lambda_{\alpha} + \lambda_{\beta} \approx 0.23104906 + 7.0729304 \approx 7.30397946$ min$^{-1}$.

$N(10) = 5 \times 10^{34} e^{-7.30397946 \times 10} = 5 \times 10^{34} e^{-73.0397946}$.
$e^{-73.0397946} \approx 5.111 \times 10^{-32}$.

$N(10) = 5 \times 10^{34} \times 5.111 \times 10^{-32} = 25.555 \times 10^2 = 2555.5$.

Activity of $\alpha$ decay $A_{\alpha}(10) = \lambda_{\alpha} N(10)$.
Using $\lambda_{\alpha}$ in min$^{-1}$:
$A_{\alpha}(10) = 0.23104906 \times 2555.5 \approx 590.46$ decays per minute.
Convert to Bq (decays per second):
$A_{\alpha}(10) = 590.46 / 60 \approx 9.841$ Bq.

This is still not matching the options.

Let's consider a different interpretation. Could the question imply the activity due to alpha decay only, without considering the reduction of X due to beta decay?  No, the decay of X into two channels is competitive, and the number of X will decrease based on the total decay constant.

Let's recheck the calculation of $e^{-73.02}$.
Using an online calculator, $e^{-73.02} \approx 5.1195 \times 10^{-32}$.

$A_{\alpha}(10) = 1.155 \times 10^{34} \times 5.1195 \times 10^{-32} / 60$
$A_{\alpha}(10) = 5.9121225 \times 10^2 / 60$
$A_{\alpha}(10) = 591.21225 / 60 \approx 9.8535$ Bq.

Still not matching. Let's review the formula and concepts.
The activity of a particular decay mode in the presence of multiple decay modes is given by $A_i(t) = \lambda_i N(t)$, where $N(t)$ is the number of parent nuclei at time t, and $\lambda_i$ is the decay constant for that specific mode. The number of parent nuclei decreases according to the total decay constant: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-(\sum \lambda_i) t}$.

Double-check the units. Half-life is in minutes, so decay constants are in min$^{-1}$. To get activity in Bq, we need to convert to seconds.

Consider the possibility of a mistake in the answer choices or the problem statement.

Let's try working backwards from the answer choices. Option (A) is the most plausible order of magnitude.
If $A_{\alpha}(10) = 1.911 \times 10^{31}$ Bq, then in decays per minute, it is $1.911 \times 10^{31} \times 60 = 1.1466 \times 10^{33}$ min$^{-1}$.
We have $A_{\alpha}(10) = \lambda_{\alpha} N_0 e^{-(\lambda_{\alpha} + \lambda_{\beta})t}$.
$1.1466 \times 10^{33} = 0.231 \times 5 \times 10^{34} \times e^{-(0.231+7.071) \times 10}$
$1.1466 \times 10^{33} = 1.155 \times 10^{34} \times e^{-73.02}$
$e^{-73.02} = \frac{1.1466 \times 10^{33}}{1.155 \times 10^{34}} = 0.09927 \times 10^{-1} = 0.009927$.
But we calculated $e^{-73.02} \approx 5.12 \times 10^{-32}$. This does not match.

Could there be a mistake in the interpretation of "partial half life"? The standard interpretation is that if a nucleus has multiple decay modes, each mode has a partial half-life associated with it, and the overall decay constant is the sum of the individual decay constants.

Let's review the calculation steps once more meticulously.
$\lambda_{\alpha} = \frac{\ln 2}{3}$ min$^{-1}$.
$\lambda_{\beta} = \frac{\ln 2}{0.098}$ min$^{-1}$.
$N(t) = N_0 e^{-(\lambda_{\alpha} + \lambda_{\beta})t}$.
Activity of $\alpha$ decay = $\lambda_{\alpha} N(t) = \lambda_{\alpha} N_0 e^{-(\lambda_{\alpha} + \lambda_{\beta})t}$.

Time t = 10 minutes.
$A_{\alpha}(10) = \frac{\ln 2}{3} \times 5 \times 10^{34} \times e^{-(\frac{\ln 2}{3} + \frac{\ln 2}{0.098}) \times 10}$.
$A_{\alpha}(10) = \frac{\ln 2}{3} \times 5 \times 10^{34} \times e^{-\ln 2 (\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{0.098}) \times 10}$.
$A_{\alpha}(10) = \frac{\ln 2}{3} \times 5 \times 10^{34} \times e^{-\ln 2 (0.3333 + 10.204) \times 10}$.
$A_{\alpha}(10) = \frac{\ln 2}{3} \times 5 \times 10^{34} \times e^{-\ln 2 (10.537) \times 10}$.
$A_{\alpha}(10) = \frac{\ln 2}{3} \times 5 \times 10^{34} \times e^{-\ln 2 \times 105.37}$.
$A_{\alpha}(10) = \frac{\ln 2}{3} \times 5 \times 10^{34} \times (e^{\ln 2})^{-105.37}$.
$A_{\alpha}(10) = \frac{\ln 2}{3} \times 5 \times 10^{34} \times 2^{-105.37}$.

$2^{-105.37}$ is a very small number.
$2^{-105.37} \approx 1.93 \times 10^{-32}$.

$A_{\alpha}(10) = \frac{0.693}{3} \times 5 \times 10^{34} \times 1.93 \times 10^{-32}$ min$^{-1}$.
$A_{\alpha}(10) = 0.231 \times 5 \times 10^{34} \times 1.93 \times 10^{-32}$ min$^{-1}$.
$A_{\alpha}(10) = 1.155 \times 1.93 \times 10^2$ min$^{-1}$.
$A_{\alpha}(10) = 2.22915 \times 100 = 222.915$ min$^{-1}$.

Convert to Bq: $222.915 / 60 \approx 3.715$ Bq.

This is very close to option (B). Let's check the precision.

Using more precise values:
$\lambda_{\alpha} = 0.231049$ min$^{-1}$.
$\lambda_{\beta} = 7.07293$ min$^{-1}$.
$\lambda = 7.303979$ min$^{-1}$.
$A_{\alpha}(10) = 0.231049 \times 5 \times 10^{34} \times e^{-7.303979 \times 10}$.
$A_{\alpha}(10) = 1.155245 \times 10^{34} \times e^{-73.03979}$.
$e^{-73.03979} \approx 5.111 \times 10^{-32}$.
$A_{\alpha}(10) = 1.155245 \times 10^{34} \times 5.111 \times 10^{-32} = 5.904$ decays per minute.
Convert to Bq: $5.904 / 60 = 0.0984$ Bq.

There's still a factor of 100 difference. Let's review the question constraints and units. The activity is asked in Bq.

If we use the approximate value from the options: 3.719 Bq.
$3.719 \text{ decays/second} = 3.719 \times 60 \text{ decays/minute} = 223.14$ min$^{-1}$.
We calculated $A_{\alpha}(10) = 222.915$ min$^{-1}$. The slight difference could be due to rounding.
