Problem:
The set of points $\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}\right)$ in $\mathbf{R}^{4}$ such that $x_{1} \geq x_{2} \geq x_{3} \geq x_{4}$ is a cone (or hypercone, if you insist). Into how many regions is this cone sliced by the hyperplanes $x_{i}-x_{j}=1$ for $1 \leq i<j \leq n$ ?

Domain: Combinatorics

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
