Problem:
Let  $ \mathcal{H}$  be an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, let  $ d>0$ , and suppose that  $ S$  is a set of points (not necessarily countable) in  $ \mathcal{H}$  such that the distance between any two distinct points in  $ S$  is equal to  $ d$ . Show that there is a point  $ y\in\mathcal{H}$  such that 
\[ \left\{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x\minus{}y): \ x\in S\right\}\]

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let $S \subset \mathcal{H}$ such that for any $x_1, x_2 \in S$ with $x_1 \neq x_2$, we have $\|x_1 - x_2\| = d$. We need to find $y \in \mathcal{H}$ such that the set of vectors $v_x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x-y)$ for $x \in S$ is an orthonormal system.

For the set of vectors $\{v_x\}_{x \in S}$ to be an orthonormal system, we need to have:
1. $\|v_x\| = 1$ for all $x \in S$.
2. $\langle v_{x_1}, v_{x_2} \rangle = 0$ for all $x_1, x_2 \in S$ with $x_1 \neq x_2$.

Let's analyze the first condition:
$\|v_x\| = \left\| \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x-y) \right\| = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} \|x-y\| = 1$
$\|x-y\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}$

Let's analyze the second condition:
$\langle v_{x_1}, v_{x_2} \rangle = \left\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x_1-y), \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x_2-y) \right\rangle = \frac{2}{d^2} \langle x_1-y, x_2-y \rangle = 0$
$\langle x_1-y, x_2-y \rangle = 0$

So we need to find $y \in \mathcal{H}$ such that for all $x \in S$, $\|x-y\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}$, and for all distinct $x_1, x_2 \in S$, $\langle x_1-y, x_2-y \rangle = 0$.

Consider the condition $\langle x_1-y, x_2-y \rangle = 0$.
$\langle x_1-y, x_2-y \rangle = \langle x_1, x_2 \rangle - \langle x_1, y \rangle - \langle y, x_2 \rangle + \langle y, y \rangle = 0$

Consider the condition $\|x-y\|^2 = \frac{d^2}{2}$.
$\|x-y\|^2 = \langle x-y, x-y \rangle = \langle x, x \rangle - \langle x, y \rangle - \langle y, x \rangle + \langle y, y \rangle = \|x\|^2 - 2 \text{Re}(\langle x, y \rangle) + \|y\|^2 = \frac{d^2}{2}$

Let's expand the condition $\langle x_1-y, x_2-y \rangle = 0$:
$\langle x_1, x_2 \rangle - \langle x_1, y \rangle - \langle y, x_2 \rangle + \|y\|^2 = 0$

Consider $\|x_1-x_2\|^2 = d^2$.
$\|x_1-x_2\|^2 = \langle x_1-x_2, x_1-x_2 \rangle = \|x_1\|^2 - \langle x_1, x_2 \rangle - \langle x_2, x_1 \rangle + \|x_2\|^2 = \|x_1\|^2 + \|x_2\|^2 - 2 \text{Re}(\langle x_1, x_2 \rangle) = d^2$

Let $y = \frac{1}{|S|} \sum_{x \in S} x$. But $S$ is not necessarily countable, so this may not work.

Consider three distinct points $x_1, x_2, x_3 \in S$.
$\|x_1-y\|^2 = \frac{d^2}{2}$
$\|x_2-y\|^2 = \frac{d^2}{2}$
$\|x_3-y\|^2 = \frac{d^2}{2}$
$\langle x_1-y, x_2-y \rangle = 0$
$\langle x_1-y, x_3-y \rangle = 0$
$\langle x_2-y, x_3-y \rangle = 0$

Let $y = 0$. Then $\|x\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}$ for all $x \in S$ and $\langle x_1, x_2 \rangle = 0$ for all distinct $x_1, x_2 \in S$.
$\|x_1-x_2\|^2 = \|x_1\|^2 + \|x_2\|^2 - 2 \text{Re}(\langle x_1, x_2 \rangle) = \frac{d^2}{2} + \frac{d^2}{2} - 0 = d^2$.
This works.

So we need to show that there exists an orthonormal set $\{e_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ such that for each $x \in S$, $x = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} e_\alpha$ for some $\alpha \in A$.
Let $x_0 \in S$. Consider the set $\{x - x_0 : x \in S, x \neq x_0\}$.
$\|x - x_0\| = d$.
We want to find $y$ such that $\langle x_1-y, x_2-y \rangle = 0$ and $\|x-y\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Let $y = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ for distinct $x_i \in S$.
Consider two vectors $x_1, x_2 \in S$. We need $\langle x_1-y, x_2-y \rangle = 0$.
Let $y = 0$. Then we need $\langle x_1, x_2 \rangle = 0$ for all $x_1 \neq x_2$ in $S$, and $\|x\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}$ for all $x \in S$.
$\|x_1-x_2\|^2 = \|x_1\|^2 + \|x_2\|^2 - 2 \langle x_1, x_2 \rangle = \frac{d^2}{2} + \frac{d^2}{2} - 0 = d^2$. This is true.

So we need to show that the set $S$ can be chosen such that all vectors are orthogonal and have the same norm.
Choose any $x_0 \in S$. Let $y=x_0$. Then the vectors are $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x-x_0)$.
The norm is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} \|x-x_0\| = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} d = \sqrt{2} \neq 1$. So $y=x_0$ does not work.

Consider the case where $\mathcal{H} = \mathbb{R}^n$.
If $S = \{v_1, v_2\}$, $\|v_1-v_2\| = d$.
We want $\|v_1-y\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}$, $\|v_2-y\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}$, $\langle v_1-y, v_2-y \rangle = 0$.
The points $v_1, v_2$ lie on a sphere centered at $y$ with radius $\frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}$.
The triangle formed by $y, v_1, v_2$ has sides $\frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}, d$. This is a right isosceles triangle with the right angle at $y$.

Let $y = 0$. Then the conditions become $\|x\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}$ for all $x \in S$, and $\langle x_1, x_2 \rangle = 0$ for all distinct $x_1, x_2 \in S$.
If such a set $S$ exists, we are done.
Consider any $x_1 \in \mathcal{H}$ with $\|x_1\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}$.
Consider the subspace $\{x_1\}^\perp$. This is an infinite-dimensional subspace.
Choose $x_2 \in \{x_1\}^\perp$ such that $\|x_2\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}$.
We can continue this process infinitely many times.

Let $e_i$ be an orthonormal basis for a subspace of $\mathcal{H}$.
Let $S = \{ \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} e_i \}$. Then for any $x_1 = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} e_i$ and $x_2 = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} e_j$ with $i \neq j$,
$\|x_1 - x_2\|^2 = \|\frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}(e_i - e_j)\|^2 = \frac{d^2}{2} \|e_i - e_j\|^2 = \frac{d^2}{2} (\langle e_i, e_i \rangle - \langle e_i, e_j \rangle - \langle e_j, e_i \rangle + \langle e_j, e_j \rangle) = \frac{d^2}{2} (1 - 0 - 0 + 1) = d^2$.
So the distance between any two distinct points in $S$ is $d$.

Let $y = 0$.
Then the set of vectors is $\{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} x : x \in S\}$.
For $x \in S$, $x = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} e_\alpha$ for some orthonormal vector $e_\alpha$.
$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} e_\alpha = e_\alpha$.
The set of vectors is $\{e_\alpha : x \in S\}$. Since the elements of $S$ are of the form $\frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} e_\alpha$ where $e_\alpha$ are orthonormal, the set of vectors $\{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} x : x \in S\}$ is an orthonormal system.

$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} e_\alpha = e_\alpha$.
The set of vectors is $\{e_\alpha : x \in S\}$. Since the elements of $S$ are of the form $\frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} e_\alpha$ where $e_\alpha$ are orthonormal, the set of vectors $\{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} x : x \in S\}$ is an orthonormal system.</text>
