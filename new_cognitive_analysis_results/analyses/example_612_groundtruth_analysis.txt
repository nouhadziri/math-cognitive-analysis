<explanation>The solver has determined the final answer of 330, which represents m+n in the problem. This demonstrates number sense as they've worked with numerical values to arrive at this specific result. Though the solution doesn't show intermediate steps, arriving at this precise numerical answer requires understanding numerical relationships.</explanation>

<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>330</text>
<explanation>Though not explicitly shown in the brief solution, reaching this answer would have required significant algebraic manipulation. The solver would have needed to work with the given polynomial equations, substitute the known roots, and solve for the unknown values m and n. This implies manipulating polynomial expressions of the form x³ + ax + b and x³ + cx² + d.</explanation>

<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>330</text>
<explanation>The problem involves analyzing the roots of two different cubic polynomials that share a complex root. The solver would have needed to use the fact that -20 is a root of one polynomial and -21 is a root of another, then determine the shared complex root m + √n·i. This requires deep understanding of polynomial root properties.</explanation>

<definition>The ability to work with complex numbers, including operations with imaginary components and understanding the relationship between complex conjugates.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>330</text>
<explanation>The problem involves a complex root m + √n·i, which means the solver had to work with complex numbers. To arrive at the answer, they would have needed to understand that complex roots of polynomials with real coefficients come in conjugate pairs, and manipulate these complex expressions appropriately.</explanation>

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify patterns, relationships, or structures within mathematical problems that can lead to efficient solution strategies.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>330</text>
<explanation>Arriving at the answer of 330 suggests the solver recognized patterns in how the roots of the polynomials relate to each other. They likely identified that if the polynomials share a complex root, certain relationships must exist between the coefficients and the other roots, allowing them to determine the values of m and n.</explanation>

<definition>The ability to apply Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to the sums and products of its roots.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>330</text>
<explanation>To solve this problem, the solver would almost certainly have used Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients a, b, c, and d to the roots of the polynomials. This would allow them to set up equations based on the known roots (-20 and -21) and the shared complex root, eventually leading to the values of m and n.</explanation>
