Problem:
Serge and Lis each have a machine that prints a digit from 1 to 6. Serge's machine prints the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6$ with probability $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}, p_{5}, p_{6}$, respectively. Lis's machine prints the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6$ with probability $q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, q_{4}, q_{5}, q_{6}$, respectively. Each of the machines prints one digit. Let $S(i)$ be the probability that the sum of the two digits printed is $i$. If $S(2)=S(12)=\frac{1}{2} S(7)$ and $S(7)>0$, prove that $p_{1}=p_{6}$ and $q_{1}=q_{6}$.

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
For the sum of the two digits printed to be 2, each digit must equal 1.

Thus, $S(2)=p_{1} q_{1}$.

For the sum of the two digits printed to be 12, each digit must equal 6 .

Thus, $S(12)=p_{6} q_{6}$.

For the sum of the two digits printed to be 7 , the digits must be 1 and 6 , or 2 and 5 , or 3 and 4 , or 4 and 3 , or 5 and 2 , or 6 and 1 .

Thus, $S(7)=p_{1} q_{6}+p_{2} q_{5}+p_{3} q_{4}+p_{4} q_{3}+p_{5} q_{2}+p_{6} q_{1}$.

Since $S(2)=S(12)$, then $p_{1} q_{1}=p_{6} q_{6}$.

Since $S(2)>0$ and $S(12)>0$, then $p_{1}, q_{1}, p_{6}, q_{6}>0$.

If $p_{1}=p_{6}$, then we can divide both sides of $p_{1} q_{1}=p_{6} q_{6}$ by $p_{1}=p_{6}$ to obtain $q_{1}=q_{6}$.

If $q_{1}=q_{6}$, then we can divide both sides of $p_{1} q_{1}=p_{6} q_{6}$ by $q_{1}=q_{6}$ to obtain $p_{1}=p_{6}$.

Therefore, if we can show that either $p_{1}=p_{6}$ or $q_{1}=q_{6}$, our result will be true.

Suppose that $p_{1} \neq p_{6}$ and $q_{1} \neq q_{6}$.

Since $S(2)=\frac{1}{2} S(7)$ and $S(12)=\frac{1}{2} S(7)$, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
S(7)-\frac{1}{2} S(7)-\frac{1}{2} S(7) & =0 \\
S(7)-S(2)-S(12) & =0 \\
p_{1} q_{6}+p_{2} q_{5}+p_{3} q_{4}+p_{4} q_{3}+p_{5} q_{2}+p_{6} q_{1}-p_{1} q_{1}-p_{6} q_{6} & =0 \\
p_{1} q_{6}+p_{6} q_{1}-p_{1} q_{1}-p_{6} q_{6}+\left(p_{2} q_{5}+p_{3} q_{4}+p_{4} q_{3}+p_{5} q_{2}\right) & =0 \\
\left(p_{1}-p_{6}\right)\left(q_{6}-q_{1}\right)+\left(p_{2} q_{5}+p_{3} q_{4}+p_{4} q_{3}+p_{5} q_{2}\right) & =0 \\
p_{2} q_{5}+p_{3} q_{4}+p_{4} q_{3}+p_{5} q_{2} & =-\left(p_{1}-p_{6}\right)\left(q_{6}-q_{1}\right) \\
p_{2} q_{5}+p_{3} q_{4}+p_{4} q_{3}+p_{5} q_{2} & =\left(p_{1}-p_{6}\right)\left(q_{1}-q_{6}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}, p_{5}, q_{2}, q_{3}, q_{4}, q_{5} \geq 0$, then $p_{2} q_{5}+p_{3} q_{4}+p_{4} q_{3}+p_{5} q_{2} \geq 0$.

From this, $\left(p_{1}-p_{6}\right)\left(q_{1}-q_{6}\right) \geq 0$.

Since $p_{1} \neq p_{6}$, then either $p_{1}>p_{6}$ or $p_{1}<p_{6}$.

If $p_{1}>p_{6}$, then $p_{1}-p_{6}>0$ and so $\left(p_{1}-p_{6}\right)\left(q_{1}-q_{6}\right) \geq 0$ tells us that $q_{1}-q_{6}>0$ which means $q_{1}>q_{6}$.

But we know that $p_{1} q_{1}=p_{6} q_{6}$ and $p_{1}, q_{1}, p_{6}, q_{6}>0$ so we cannot have $p_{1}>p_{6}$ and $q_{1}>q_{6}$. If $p_{1}<p_{6}$, then $p_{1}-p_{6}<0$ and so $\left(p_{1}-p_{6}\right)\left(q_{1}-q_{6}\right) \geq 0$ tells us that $q_{1}-q_{6}<0$ which means $q_{1}<q_{6}$.

But we know that $p_{1} q_{1}=p_{6} q_{6}$ and $p_{1}, q_{1}, p_{6}, q_{6}>0$ so we cannot have $p_{1}<p_{6}$ and $q_{1}<q_{6}$. This is a contradiction.

Therefore, since we cannot have $p_{1}>p_{6}$ or $p_{1}<p_{6}$, it must be the case that $p_{1}=p_{6}$ which means that $q_{1}=q_{6}$, as required.

But we know that $p_{1} q_{1}=p_{6} q_{6}$ and $p_{1}, q_{1}, p_{6}, q_{6}>0$ so we cannot have $p_{1}>p_{6}$ and $q_{1}>q_{6}$.</text>

<text>Suppose that $p_{1} \neq p_{6}$ and $q_{1} \neq q_{6}$.

Since $S(2)=\frac{1}{2} S(7)$ and $S(12)=\frac{1}{2} S(7)$, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
S(7)-\frac{1}{2} S(7)-\frac{1}{2} S(7) & =0 \\
S(7)-S(2)-S(12) & =0 \\

\end{aligned}
$$

Since $p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}, p_{5}, q_{2}, q_{3}, q_{4}, q_{5} \geq 0$, then $p_{2} q_{5}+p_{3} q_{4}+p_{4} q_{3}+p_{5} q_{2} \geq 0$.

From this, $\left(p_{1}-p_{6}\right)\left(q_{1}-q_{6}\right) \geq 0$.

Since $p_{1} \neq p_{6}$, then either $p_{1}>p_{6}$ or $p_{1}<p_{6}$.

If $p_{1}>p_{6}$, then $p_{1}-p_{6}>0$ and so $\left(p_{1}-p_{6}\right)\left(q_{1}-q_{6}\right) \geq 0$ tells us that $q_{1}-q_{6}>0$ which means $q_{1}>q_{6}$.

But we know that $p_{1} q_{1}=p_{6} q_{6}$ and $p_{1}, q_{1}, p_{6}, q_{6}>0$ so we cannot have $p_{1}>p_{6}$ and $q_{1}>q_{6}$. If $p_{1}<p_{6}$, then $p_{1}-p_{6}<0$ and so $\left(p_{1}-p_{6}\right)\left(q_{1}-q_{6}\right) \geq 0$ tells us that $q_{1}-q_{6}<0$ which means $q_{1}<q_{6}$.

But we know that $p_{1} q_{1}=p_{6} q_{6}$ and $p_{1}, q_{1}, p_{6}, q_{6}>0$ so we cannot have $p_{1}<p_{6}$ and $q_{1}<q_{6}$. This is a contradiction.

Therefore, since we cannot have $p_{1}>p_{6}$ or $p_{1}<p_{6}$, it must be the case that $p_{1}=p_{6}$ which means that $q_{1}=q_{6}$, as required.</text>
<explanation>The entire passage from the assumption that $p_1 \neq p_6$ and $q_1 \neq q_6$ to the final conclusion demonstrates a complete proof by contradiction. The solver assumes the negation of what they want to prove, derives a contradiction through logical steps, and concludes that the original statement must be true. This is a comprehensive application of the proof by contradiction technique.</explanation>
