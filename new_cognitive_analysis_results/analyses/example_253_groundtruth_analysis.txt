Problem:
Let $z_1,$ $z_2,$ $z_3$ be complex numbers such that $|z_1| = 1,$ $|z_2| = 2,$ $|z_3| = 3,$ and
\[|9z_1 z_2 + 4z_1 z_3 + z_2 z_3| = 12.\]Find $|z_1 + z_2 + z_3|.$

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Since a complex number and its conjugate always have the same magnitude,
\[|\overline{9z_1 z_2 + 4z_1 z_3 + z_2 z_3}| = |9 \overline{z}_1 \overline{z}_2 + 4 \overline{z}_1 \overline{z}_3 + \overline{z}_2 \overline{z}_3| = 12.\]From the given information, $z_1 \overline{z}_1 = |z_1|^2 = 1,$ so $\overline{z}_1 = \frac{1}{z_1}.$  Similarly,
\[\overline{z}_2 = \frac{4}{z_2} \quad \text{and} \quad \overline{z}_3 = \frac{9}{z_3},\]so
\begin{align*}
|9 \overline{z}_1 \overline{z}_2 + 4 \overline{z}_1 \overline{z}_3 + \overline{z}_2 \overline{z}_3| &= \left| 9 \cdot \frac{1}{z_1} \cdot \frac{4}{z_2} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{z_1} \cdot \frac{9}{z_3} + \frac{4}{z_2} \cdot \frac{9}{z_3} \right| \\
&= \left| \frac{36}{z_1 z_2} + \frac{36}{z_1 z_3} + \frac{36}{z_2 z_3} \right| \\
&= \frac{36}{|z_1 z_2 z_3|} |z_1 + z_2 + z_3| \\
&= \frac{36}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3} |z_1 + z_2 + z_3| \\
&= 6 |z_1 + z_2 + z_3|.
\end{align*}But this quantity is also 12, so $|z_1 + z_2 + z_3| = \boxed{2}.$
