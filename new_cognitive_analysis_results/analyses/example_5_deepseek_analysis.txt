Problem:
One base of a trapezoid is $100$ units longer than the other base. The segment that joins the midpoints of the legs divides the trapezoid into two regions whose areas are in the ratio $2: 3$ . Let $x$ be the length of the segment joining the legs of the trapezoid that is parallel to the bases and that divides the trapezoid into two regions of equal area. Find the greatest integer that does not exceed $x^2/100$ .

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem about a trapezoid with bases differing by 100 units. The segment connecting the midpoints of the legs divides the trapezoid into two regions with areas in the ratio 2:3. Then, we need to find x, which is the length of the segment that divides the trapezoid into two equal areas, and then find the greatest integer not exceeding x2/100. 

First, let me recall some trapezoid properties. In a trapezoid, the midline (the segment connecting the midpoints of the legs) has a length equal to the average of the two bases. Also, if there is a segment parallel to the bases that divides the trapezoid into two regions of equal area, its length x should be such that the square of x is the average of the squares of the two bases. Wait, no, let me check. 

I remember that for areas divided by a line parallel to the bases, the ratio of the areas depends on the squares of the lengths involved. The formula for the length of a line segment parallel to the bases that creates a certain area ratio. Let me also recall that the area of a trapezoid is (a + b)/2 * h, where a and b are the lengths of the two bases, and h is the height. 

So, given that the two bases differ by 100 units, let me assign variables. Let the shorter base be b, then the longer base is b + 100. The midline length is (b + (b + 100))/2 = (2b + 100)/2 = b + 50. But the problem says that the midline divides the trapezoid into two regions with areas in the ratio 2:3. 

Wait a sec, the midline divides the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids? Each with height h/2, if the original height is h. So, the area of the upper trapezoid would be (b + (b + 50))/2 * (h/2) = (2b + 50)/2 * h/2 = (b + 25) * h/2. Similarly, the lower trapezoid would be ((b + 50) + (b + 100))/2 * (h/2) = (2b + 150)/2 * h/2 = (b + 75) * h/2. Then, the ratio of upper to lower area is (b + 25)/(b + 75) = 2/3. 

So setting up the equation: (b + 25)/(b + 75) = 2/3. Cross-multiplying: 3(b + 25) = 2(b + 75); 3b + 75 = 2b + 150; subtract 2b from both sides: b + 75 = 150; so b = 75. Therefore, the shorter base is 75 units, longer is 175 units. 

Got that. So the two bases are 75 and 175. Then, we need to find x, the length of the segment that divides the trapezoid into two regions of equal area. 

For a line segment parallel to the bases that divides the trapezoid into two regions of equal area, the length x can be found using the formula which is sort of a weighted average. Let me recall that if you have a line parallel to the bases that divides the trapezoid into two regions of equal area, then the position of that line is such that the square of its length is the average of the squares of the two bases. Wait, I might need to derive that. 

Suppose the original trapezoid has bases a and b (a = 75, b = 175 in our case), height h. We want to find a line at some height k from the base a such that the area of the trapezoid up to that line is half of the total area. The area up to that line is (a + x)/2 * k = 1/2 * [(a + b)/2 * h]. Then, simplifying, (a + x)k = (a + b)h / 2. But we also need to relate k and h. The line at height k creates a smaller trapezoid with bases a and x and height k. The ratio of heights is k/h. The problem is to find x such that this smaller trapezoid has half the area of the original.

Alternatively, since the area depends on the average of the bases times the height, to get equal areas, the ratio of the heights squared is involved? Hmm, maybe I need to use similar figures. If the trapezoid is divided into two regions by a line parallel to the bases, the two trapezoids created are similar if the line is such that the ratio of heights is the same. But in general, trapezoids are not similar unless the ratio of the bases is the same as the ratio of the heights. Wait, but these are not similar necessarily. 

Alternatively, think algebraically. Let me denote the original trapezoid with bases a = 75, b = 175, height H, area S = (75 + 175)/2 * H = 125H.

We need to find a line parallel to the bases that splits the area into two equal parts, each of area 62.5H.

Let me let x be the length of the desired segment, located at a distance h from the base a. Then the trapezoid formed by bases a and x with height h has area (75 + x)/2 * h = 62.5H. The remaining trapezoid has bases x and 175 with height H - h, and area (x + 175)/2 * (H - h) = 62.5H.

So we have two equations:

1. (75 + x)h = 125H
2. (x + 175)(H - h) = 125H

But from the first equation: h = (125H)/(75 + x)
From the second equation: (x + 175)(H - h) = 125H

Let me substitute h from the first into the second equation.

So:

(x + 175)(H - (125H)/(75 + x)) = 125H

Let me factor H out:

(x + 175)H [1 - 125/(75 + x)] = 125H

Divide both sides by H (assuming H ≠ 0):

(x + 175)(1 - 125/(75 + x)) = 125

Simplify the term in parentheses:

1 - 125/(75 + x) = [(75 + x) - 125]/(75 + x) = (x - 50)/(75 + x)

So the equation becomes:

(x + 175)(x - 50)/(75 + x) = 125

Multiply both sides by (75 + x):

(x + 175)(x - 50) = 125(75 + x)

Expand the left-hand side:

x^2 - 50x + 175x - 8750 = 125x + 9375

Simplify:

x^2 + 125x - 8750 = 125x + 9375

Subtract 125x + 9375 from both sides:

x^2 - 18125 = 0

Wait, that leads to x2 = 18125, so x = sqrt(18125) = sqrt(25 * 725) = 5 * sqrt(725). Is that right?

Wait, let me check the calculations again step by step. Probably, I made an algebraic mistake.

Starting from the two equations:

1. (75 + x)h = 125H
2. (x + 175)(H - h) = 125H

From equation 1: h = (125H)/(75 + x). Plug into equation 2:

(x + 175)(H - (125H)/(75 + x)) = 125H

Multiply out:

(x + 175)H - (x + 175)(125H)/(75 + x) = 125H

Divide both sides by H (assuming H ≠ 0):

(x + 175) - (125(x + 175))/(75 + x) = 125

Factor the second term:

Left side = (x + 175) - 125(x + 175)/(x + 75)

Let me write the entire equation:

(x + 175) - [125(x + 175)]/(x + 75) = 125

Let me let y = x + 75. Then, x + 175 = (x + 75) + 100 = y + 100.

So, substituting:

(y + 100) - [125(y + 100)]/y) = 125

Multiply through by y to eliminate the denominator:

y(y + 100) - 125(y + 100) = 125y

Factor left-hand side:

(y + 100)(y - 125) = 125y

Expanding the left-hand side:

y^2 - 125y + 100y - 12500 = 125y

Simplify:

y^2 - 25y - 12500 = 125y

Bring all terms to left side:

y^2 - 25y - 12500 - 125y = 0

Simplify:

y^2 - 150y - 12500 = 0

This is a quadratic in y: y2 -150y -12500 = 0

Solving for y using quadratic formula:

y = [150 ± sqrt(22500 + 50000)] / 2 = [150 ± sqrt(72500)] / 2

sqrt(72500) = sqrt(100*725) = 10*sqrt(725)

So y = [150 ± 10*sqrt(725)] / 2 = 75 ± 5*sqrt(725)

Since y = x + 75 and x is a length, y must be positive. So take the positive root:

y = 75 + 5*sqrt(725)

Thus, x + 75 = 75 + 5*sqrt(725) => x = 5*sqrt(725)

Therefore, x squared is 25*725 = 18125. Then x2 /100 = 18125 / 100 = 181.25, so the greatest integer not exceeding this is 181.

Wait, this seems straightforward now, but maybe I had a miscalculation in the algebra step. Let me verify quickly. 

Alternatively, perhaps it is quicker to recall the formula for the line that divides the trapezoid into equal areas. I think the formula is that the length of this line is the root mean square (RMS) of the two bases. So sqrt[(a2 + b2)/2]. Let me check if that aligns.

Given a = 75, b = 175. Compute the RMS: sqrt[(752 + 1752)/2] = sqrt[(5625 + 30625)/2] = sqrt(36250/2) = sqrt(18125) which is exactly what we have. Thus, that is consistent.

Therefore, x2 is 18125, so x2/100 is 181.25, so the greatest integer not exceeding that is 181. Therefore, the answer is 181. 

Wait, but let me verify once again. The midline divides the trapezoid into areas with ratio 2:3, leading us to bases of 75 and 175. Then, the line that divides the area into two equal parts has length sqrt[(752 +1752)/2]. So, yes, that formula gives x = sqrt(18125), so x2 with that same number. Therefore, 18125/100 = 181.25, greatest integer not exceeding 181.25 is 181. Therefore, final answer is 181. 

I think that's correct. Let me ensure that there were no algebraic mistakes. So the steps were:

1. Found bases 75 and 175 from the midline area ratio 2:3.

2. Remembered that the line dividing the area equally is the root mean square of the bases. Applied the formula, leading to x2/100 being 181.25. 

Therefore, 181 is the correct answer. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{181}
