Problem:
Find continuous functions  $x(t),\ y(t)$  such that 
 $\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ x(t)=1+\int_{0}^{t}e^{-2(t-s)}x(s)ds$ 
 $\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ y(t)=\int_{0}^{t}e^{-2(t-s)}\{2x(s)+3y(s)\}ds$ 

Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I have these two integral equations to solve for continuous functions x(t) and y(t). Let's write them out again:

1. \( x(t) = 1 + \int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} x(s) \, ds \)
2. \( y(t) = \int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} \{ 2x(s) + 3y(s) \} \, ds \)

Hmm, both equations are Volterra integral equations of the second kind, right? The kernel is \( e^{-2(t - s)} \), which looks like a convolution kernel because it depends on t - s. Maybe I can convert these integral equations into differential equations using differentiation. Since the integral is from 0 to t, differentiation might simplify things because the derivative of such an integral with a convolution kernel can relate to the original function.

Starting with the first equation for x(t):

\( x(t) = 1 + \int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} x(s) \, ds \)

Let me denote the integral part as \( \int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} x(s) \, ds \). Let's call this integral I(t). So,

\( x(t) = 1 + I(t) \)

Now, to find a differential equation, I should compute the derivative dx/dt. Let's differentiate both sides with respect to t.

d/dt [x(t)] = d/dt [1] + d/dt [I(t)]

The derivative of 1 is 0, so we have:

\( x'(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} x(s) \, ds \)

To differentiate this integral, which has the variable t both in the upper limit and inside the integrand, we can use Leibniz's rule. The general formula is:

d/dt [∫_{a(t)}^{b(t)} f(t, s) ds] = f(t, b(t)) * b'(t) - f(t, a(t)) * a'(t) + ∫_{a(t)}^{b(t)} ∂f/∂t ds

In our case, a(t) = 0, so a'(t) = 0; b(t) = t, so b'(t) = 1. The integrand is f(t, s) = e^{-2(t - s)} x(s), so ∂f/∂t = -2 e^{-2(t - s)} x(s).

Applying Leibniz's rule:

x'(t) = e^{-2(t - t)} x(t) * 1 - 0 + ∫_{0}^{t} (-2) e^{-2(t - s)} x(s) ds

Simplify each term:

e^{-2(t - t)} x(t) = e^{0} x(t) = x(t)

So,

x'(t) = x(t) - 2 ∫_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} x(s) ds

But notice that the integral here is exactly I(t), which is equal to x(t) - 1 from the original equation. Substitute that in:

x'(t) = x(t) - 2(x(t) - 1) = x(t) - 2x(t) + 2 = -x(t) + 2

Therefore, the differential equation for x(t) is:

x'(t) = -x(t) + 2

This is a linear first-order ordinary differential equation. Let's solve it.

The standard form is x' + P(t) x = Q(t). Here, we can rewrite the equation as:

x'(t) + x(t) = 2

So, P(t) = 1, Q(t) = 2.

Integrating factor mu(t) is exp(∫ P(t) dt) = exp(t).

Multiplying both sides by exp(t):

exp(t) x'(t) + exp(t) x(t) = 2 exp(t)

The left side is the derivative of [exp(t) x(t)]:

d/dt [exp(t) x(t)] = 2 exp(t)

Integrate both sides:

exp(t) x(t) = 2 ∫ exp(t) dt + C = 2 exp(t) + C

Therefore, divide both sides by exp(t):

x(t) = 2 + C exp(-t)

Now apply the initial condition. From the original integral equation, when t = 0:

x(0) = 1 + ∫_{0}^{0} ... ds = 1 + 0 = 1

Plug t = 0 into x(t) = 2 + C exp(-0) = 2 + C.

Thus:

1 = 2 + C => C = -1

Therefore, the solution for x(t) is:

x(t) = 2 - e^{-t}

Alright, that handles x(t). Now onto y(t):

\( y(t) = \int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} [2x(s) + 3y(s)] ds \)

This is also a Volterra equation. Similarly, let's denote this integral as J(t) = ∫_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} [2x(s) + 3y(s)] ds. So y(t) = J(t)

Differentiate both sides with respect to t:

y'(t) = d/dt J(t)

Again, apply Leibniz's rule. The integral is from 0 to t, with integrand e^{-2(t - s)} [2x(s) + 3y(s)]

So,

d/dt J(t) = e^{-2(t - t)} [2x(t) + 3y(t)] * 1 + ∫_{0}^{t} ∂/∂t [e^{-2(t - s)} (2x(s) + 3y(s))] ds

First term: e^{-0} [2x(t) + 3y(t)] = 2x(t) + 3y(t)

Second term: ∫_{0}^{t} [ -2 e^{-2(t - s)} (2x(s) + 3y(s)) ] ds = -2 ∫_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} (2x(s) + 3y(s)) ds = -2 J(t) = -2 y(t)

Thus, combining both terms:

y'(t) = 2x(t) + 3y(t) - 2y(t) = 2x(t) + y(t)

So the differential equation for y(t) is:

y'(t) - y(t) = 2x(t)

But we already have x(t) solved: x(t) = 2 - e^{-t}, so substitute:

y' - y = 2(2 - e^{-t}) = 4 - 2e^{-t}

This is a linear ODE for y(t). Let me write it as:

y'(t) - y(t) = 4 - 2e^{-t}

The integrating factor is exp(∫ -1 dt) = exp(-t)

Multiply both sides by exp(-t):

exp(-t) y' - exp(-t) y = (4 - 2e^{-t}) exp(-t)

The left-hand side becomes the derivative of [exp(-t) y(t)]:

d/dt [exp(-t) y(t)] = 4 exp(-t) - 2 exp(-2t)

Now, integrate both sides:

exp(-t) y(t) = 4 ∫ exp(-t) dt - 2 ∫ exp(-2t) dt + C

Compute the integrals:

∫ exp(-t) dt = -exp(-t) + C1

∫ exp(-2t) dt = (-1/2) exp(-2t) + C2

Thus,

exp(-t) y(t) = 4 (-exp(-t)) - 2 (-1/2 exp(-2t)) + C

Simplify:

exp(-t) y(t) = -4 exp(-t) + exp(-2t) + C

Multiply both sides by exp(t):

y(t) = -4 exp(0) + exp(-t) + C exp(t)

So,

y(t) = -4 + e^{-t} + C e^{t}

Now, we need an initial condition for y(t). Looking back at the original integral equation for y(t):

y(0) = ∫_{0}^{0} ... ds = 0

So when t=0:

y(0) = 0

Plug t=0 into y(t):

0 = -4 + e^{0} + C e^{0} => 0 = -4 + 1 + C => C = 3

Therefore, the solution for y(t) is:

y(t) = -4 + e^{-t} + 3 e^{t}

Let me check if this satisfies the original integral equation.

First, compute LHS: y(t) = -4 + e^{-t} + 3 e^{t}

Compute RHS: ∫_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t-s)} [2x(s) + 3y(s)] ds

But first, recall x(s) = 2 - e^{-s}, so 2x(s) = 4 - 2e^{-s}

Then, 3y(s) = 3(-4 + e^{-s} + 3 e^{s}) = -12 + 3 e^{-s} + 9 e^{s}

Thus, 2x(s) + 3y(s) = (4 -2 e^{-s}) + (-12 +3 e^{-s} +9 e^{s}) = (4 -12) + (-2 e^{-s} +3 e^{-s}) +9 e^{s} = -8 + e^{-s} +9 e^{s}

So the integral becomes:

∫_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} [ -8 + e^{-s} +9 e^{s} ] ds

Factor out e^{-2t} from the exponential:

e^{-2t} ∫_{0}^{t} e^{2s} [ -8 + e^{-s} +9 e^{s} ] ds

Compute the integrand:

e^{2s} [ -8 + e^{-s} +9 e^{s} ] = -8 e^{2s} + e^{2s} e^{-s} +9 e^{2s} e^{s} = -8 e^{2s} + e^{s} +9 e^{3s}

Therefore, the integral:

e^{-2t} [ -8 ∫_{0}^{t} e^{2s} ds + ∫_{0}^{t} e^{s} ds +9 ∫_{0}^{t} e^{3s} ds ]

Compute each integral:

First integral: ∫ e^{2s} ds from 0 to t is (1/2)(e^{2t} - 1)

Second integral: ∫ e^{s} ds from 0 to t is (e^{t} -1)

Third integral: ∫ e^{3s} ds from 0 to t is (1/3)(e^{3t} -1 )

So putting it all together:

e^{-2t} [ -8*(1/2)(e^{2t} -1) + (e^{t} -1) +9*(1/3)(e^{3t}-1) ]

Simplify:

e^{-2t} [ -4(e^{2t} -1) + (e^t -1) +3(e^{3t} -1) ]

= e^{-2t} [ -4 e^{2t} +4 + e^t -1 + 3 e^{3t} -3 ]

Combine constants: 4 -1 -3 = 0

So,

= e^{-2t} [ -4 e^{2t} + e^t +3 e^{3t} ]

Divide the exponentials:

= e^{-2t}*(-4 e^{2t}) + e^{-2t}*e^t + e^{-2t}*3 e^{3t}

= -4 e^{0} + e^{-t} + 3 e^{t}

= -4 + e^{-t} +3 e^{t}

Which matches y(t) computed earlier. So the solution satisfies the integral equation. Therefore, y(t) is correct.

So in summary:

x(t) = 2 - e^{-t}

y(t) = 3 e^{t} + e^{-t} -4

Double-check the differential equations:

For x(t):

x'(t) = derivative of 2 -e^{-t} is e^{-t}

Plug into x' = -x + 2:

Left side: e^{-t}

Right side: -(2 - e^{-t}) + 2 = -2 + e^{-t} +2 = e^{-t}

OK.

For y(t):

y'(t) = derivative of (3 e^{t} + e^{-t} -4) is 3 e^{t} - e^{-t}

Plug into y' = 2x + y:

Left side: 3 e^t - e^{-t}

Right side: 2*(2 - e^{-t}) + (3 e^t + e^{-t} -4) = 4 - 2 e^{-t} +3 e^t + e^{-t} -4 = 3 e^t - e^{-t}

Which matches. Perfect.

So all checks out.

**Final Answer**
The continuous functions are \(\boxed{x(t) = 2 - e^{-t}}\) and \(\boxed{y(t) = 3e^{t} + e^{-t} - 4}\).

In our case, a(t) = 0, so a'(t) = 0; b(t) = t, so b'(t) = 1. The integrand is f(t, s) = e^{-2(t - s)} x(s), so ∂f/∂t = -2 e^{-2(t - s)} x(s).

<text>The standard form is x' + P(t) x = Q(t). Here, we can rewrite the equation as:

So, P(t) = 1, Q(t) = 2.

Integrating factor mu(t) is exp(∫ P(t) dt) = exp(t).

Multiplying both sides by exp(t):

exp(t) x'(t) + exp(t) x(t) = 2 exp(t)

The left side is the derivative of [exp(t) x(t)]:

d/dt [exp(t) x(t)] = 2 exp(t)

Integrate both sides:

exp(t) x(t) = 2 ∫ exp(t) dt + C = 2 exp(t) + C

Therefore, divide both sides by exp(t):

x(t) = 2 + C exp(-t)

Now apply the initial condition. From the original integral equation, when t = 0:

x(0) = 1 + ∫_{0}^{0} ... ds = 1 + 0 = 1

Plug t = 0 into x(t) = 2 + C exp(-0) = 2 + C.

Thus:

1 = 2 + C => C = -1

<text>Let me check if this satisfies the original integral equation.

First, compute LHS: y(t) = -4 + e^{-t} + 3 e^{t}

Compute RHS: ∫_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t-s)} [2x(s) + 3y(s)] ds

But first, recall x(s) = 2 - e^{-s}, so 2x(s) = 4 - 2e^{-s}

Then, 3y(s) = 3(-4 + e^{-s} + 3 e^{s}) = -12 + 3 e^{-s} + 9 e^{s}

Thus, 2x(s) + 3y(s) = (4 -2 e^{-s}) + (-12 +3 e^{-s} +9 e^{s}) = (4 -12) + (-2 e^{-s} +3 e^{-s}) +9 e^{s} = -8 + e^{-s} +9 e^{s}

So the integral becomes:

∫_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} [ -8 + e^{-s} +9 e^{s} ] ds

Factor out e^{-2t} from the exponential:

e^{-2t} ∫_{0}^{t} e^{2s} [ -8 + e^{-s} +9 e^{s} ] ds

Compute the integrand:

e^{2s} [ -8 + e^{-s} +9 e^{s} ] = -8 e^{2s} + e^{2s} e^{-s} +9 e^{2s} e^{s} = -8 e^{2s} + e^{s} +9 e^{3s}

Therefore, the integral:

e^{-2t} [ -8 ∫_{0}^{t} e^{2s} ds + ∫_{0}^{t} e^{s} ds +9 ∫_{0}^{t} e^{3s} ds ]

Compute each integral:

First integral: ∫ e^{2s} ds from 0 to t is (1/2)(e^{2t} - 1)

Second integral: ∫ e^{s} ds from 0 to t is (e^{t} -1)

Third integral: ∫ e^{3s} ds from 0 to t is (1/3)(e^{3t} -1 )

So putting it all together:

e^{-2t} [ -8*(1/2)(e^{2t} -1) + (e^{t} -1) +9*(1/3)(e^{3t}-1) ]

Simplify:

e^{-2t} [ -4(e^{2t} -1) + (e^t -1) +3(e^{3t} -1) ]

= e^{-2t} [ -4 e^{2t} +4 + e^t -1 + 3 e^{3t} -3 ]

Combine constants: 4 -1 -3 = 0

So,

= e^{-2t} [ -4 e^{2t} + e^t +3 e^{3t} ]

Divide the exponentials:

= e^{-2t}*(-4 e^{2t}) + e^{-2t}*e^t + e^{-2t}*3 e^{3t}

= -4 e^{0} + e^{-t} + 3 e^{t}

= -4 + e^{-t} +3 e^{t}
