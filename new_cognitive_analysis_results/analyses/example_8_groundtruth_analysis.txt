Problem:
Kathy has $5$ red cards and $5$ green cards. She shuffles the $10$ cards and lays out $5$ of the cards in a row in a random order. She will be happy if and only if all the red cards laid out are adjacent and all the green cards laid out are adjacent. For example, card orders RRGGG, GGGGR, or RRRRR will make Kathy happy, but RRRGR will not. The probability that Kathy will be happy is $\frac{m}{n}$ , where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$ .

<skill>Problem Interpretation</skill>
<definition>The ability to understand and make sense of a problem statement, identifying key components, constraints, and the goal of the problem.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>157</end>
<text>157</text>
<explanation>The solution "157" represents the final answer to the problem, indicating that the solver has fully interpreted the problem requirement to find m+n where m/n is the probability that Kathy will be happy with the card arrangement. The brevity of the solution suggests the solver understood what was being asked but did not show their working.</explanation>

<skill>Probability Calculation</skill>
<definition>The ability to determine the likelihood of specific outcomes in scenarios involving randomness by calculating favorable outcomes divided by total possible outcomes.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>157</end>
<text>157</text>
<explanation>The solution implies that the solver calculated a probability in the form m/n (as required by the problem) and then added these values to get 157. This involves understanding and applying probability concepts to determine the chance of getting a satisfactory card arrangement.</explanation>

<skill>Combinatorial Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to count and enumerate possibilities systematically, often using principles of combinatorics to determine the number of ways certain arrangements or selections can occur.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>157</end>
<text>157</text>
<explanation>The problem requires counting favorable arrangements (where red and green cards are each adjacent) and total possible arrangements of selecting 5 cards from 10 cards. The answer suggests the solver used combinatorial principles to enumerate these possibilities.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Modeling</skill>
<definition>The ability to translate a real-world or described scenario into mathematical terms, variables, and equations that can be solved using mathematical techniques.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>157</end>
<text>157</text>
<explanation>The solver had to model Kathy's card problem mathematically, translating the conditions of "happy" arrangements (adjacent cards of same color) into a mathematical framework that allowed for probability calculation.</explanation>

<skill>Number Theory Application</skill>
<definition>The ability to apply principles of number theory, particularly concepts related to properties of integers such as divisibility, prime factorization, and relatively prime numbers.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>157</end>
<text>157</text>
<explanation>The problem specifically asks for m and n to be relatively prime positive integers. The answer 157 suggests the solver found such values and ensured they had no common factors before adding them together.</explanation>

<skill>Fraction Simplification</skill>
<definition>The ability to reduce fractions to their simplest form by identifying and dividing by common factors of the numerator and denominator.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>157</end>
<text>157</text>
<explanation>The problem requires expressing the probability as a fraction m/n in lowest terms (relatively prime). The solver would have needed to simplify their probability fraction to ensure m and n have no common factors.</explanation>
