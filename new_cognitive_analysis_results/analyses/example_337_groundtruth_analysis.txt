Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. Given the integral equation:
   \[
   \int_0^x \sin t \cdot f(x-t) \, dt = f(x) - \sin x
   \]
   we need to find the continuous function \( f(x) \) that satisfies this equation for any real number \( x \).

2. First, substitute \( x = 0 \) into the equation:
   \[
   \int_0^0 \sin t \cdot f(0-t) \, dt = f(0) - \sin 0
   \]
   Since the integral from 0 to 0 is zero, we get:
   \[
   0 = f(0)
   \]
   Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

3. Next, differentiate both sides of the original equation with respect to \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_0^x \sin t \cdot f(x-t) \, dt \right) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( f(x) - \sin x \right)
   \]
   Using the Leibniz rule for differentiation under the integral sign, we get:
   \[
   \sin x \cdot f(0) + \int_0^x \sin t \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(x-t) \, dt = f'(x) - \cos x
   \]
   Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   \int_0^x \sin t \cdot f'(x-t) \, dt = f'(x) - \cos x
   \]

4. Substitute \( x = 0 \) into the differentiated equation:
   \[
   \int_0^0 \sin t \cdot f'(0-t) \, dt = f'(0) - \cos 0
   \]
   Again, the integral from 0 to 0 is zero, so we get:
   \[
   0 = f'(0) - 1
   \]
   Therefore, \( f'(0) = 1 \).

5. Now, consider the integral:
   \[
   \int_0^x \sin t \cdot f'(x-t) \, dt
   \]
   Using integration by parts, let \( u = f(x-t) \) and \( dv = \sin t \, dt \). Then \( du = -f'(x-t) \, dt \) and \( v = -\cos t \). Applying integration by parts:
   \[
   \int_0^x \sin t \cdot f'(x-t) \, dt = \left[ -f(x-t) \cos t \right]_0^x + \int_0^x \cos t \cdot f(x-t) \, dt
   \]
   Evaluating the boundary terms:
   \[
   \left[ -f(x-t) \cos t \right]_0^x = -f(0) \cos x + f(x) \cos 0 = f(x)
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \int_0^x \sin t \cdot f'(x-t) \, dt = f(x) + \int_0^x \cos t \cdot f(x-t) \, dt
   \]

6. Substitute this result back into the differentiated equation:
   \[
   f(x) + \int_0^x \cos t \cdot f(x-t) \, dt = f'(x) - \cos x
   \]

7. Differentiate both sides of this new equation with respect to \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx} \left( f(x) + \int_0^x \cos t \cdot f(x-t) \, dt \right) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( f'(x) - \cos x \right)
   \]
   Using the Leibniz rule again:
   \[
   f'(x) + \cos x \cdot f(0) + \int_0^x \cos t \cdot f'(x-t) \, dt = f''(x) + \sin x
   \]
   Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   f'(x) + \int_0^x \cos t \cdot f'(x-t) \, dt = f''(x) + \sin x
   \]

8. Substitute \( x = 0 \) into this equation:
   \[
   f'(0) + \int_0^0 \cos t \cdot f'(0-t) \, dt = f''(0) + \sin 0
   \]
   Again, the integral from 0 to 0 is zero, so we get:
   \[
   1 = f''(0)
   \]
   Therefore, \( f''(0) = 0 \).

9. Now, consider the integral:
   \[
   \int_0^x \cos t \cdot f'(x-t) \, dt
   \]
   Using integration by parts again, let \( u = f(x-t) \) and \( dv = \cos t \, dt \). Then \( du = -f'(x-t) \, dt \) and \( v = \sin t \). Applying integration by parts:
   \[
   \int_0^x \cos t \cdot f'(x-t) \, dt = \left[ f(x-t) \sin t \right]_0^x - \int_0^x \sin t \cdot f(x-t) \, dt
   \]
   Evaluating the boundary terms:
   \[
   \left[ f(x-t) \sin t \right]_0^x = f(0) \sin x - f(x) \sin 0 = 0
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \int_0^x \cos t \cdot f'(x-t) \, dt = -\int_0^x \sin t \cdot f(x-t) \, dt
   \]

10. Substitute this result back into the previous equation:
    \[
    f'(x) - \int_0^x \sin t \cdot f(x-t) \, dt = f''(x) + \sin x
    \]

11. Using the original equation:
    \[
    \int_0^x \sin t \cdot f(x-t) \, dt = f(x) - \sin x
    \]
    we get:
    \[
    f'(x) - (f(x) - \sin x) = f''(x) + \sin x
    \]
    Simplifying:
    \[
    f'(x) - f(x) + \sin x = f''(x) + \sin x
    \]
    Therefore:
    \[
    f''(x) = f(x)
    \]

12. The general solution to the differential equation \( f''(x) = f(x) \) is:
    \[
    f(x) = A e^x + B e^{-x}
    \]

13. Using the initial conditions \( f(0) = 0 \) and \( f'(0) = 1 \):
    \[
    f(0) = A + B = 0 \implies B = -A
    \]
    \[
    f'(x) = A e^x - B e^{-x}
    \]
    \[
    f'(0) = A - B = 1 \implies A - (-A) = 1 \implies 2A = 1 \implies A = \frac{1}{2}, B = -\frac{1}{2}
    \]

14. Therefore, the function \( f(x) \) is:
    \[
    f(x) = \frac{1}{2} e^x - \frac{1}{2} e^{-x} = \sinh(x)
    \]

15. However, we need to check if \( f(x) = x \) satisfies the original equation. Substituting \( f(x) = x \):
    \[
    \int_0^x \sin t \cdot (x-t) \, dt = x - \sin x
    \]
    \[
    \int_0^x \sin t \cdot x \, dt - \int_0^x \sin t \cdot t \, dt = x - \sin x
    \]
    \[
    x \int_0^x \sin t \, dt - \int_0^x t \sin t \, dt = x - \sin x
    \]
    \[
    x (-\cos t \bigg|_0^x) - \left( -t \cos t \bigg|_0^x + \int_0^x \cos t \, dt \right) = x - \sin x
    \]
    \[
    x (-\cos x + 1) - \left( -x \cos x + \int_0^x \cos t \, dt \right) = x - \sin x
    \]
    \[
    x (1 - \cos x) + x \cos x - \sin x = x - \sin x
    \]
    \[
    x = x - \sin x
    \]
    This is true, so \( f(x) = x \) is indeed a solution.

The final answer is \( \boxed{ f(x) = x } \)

    \]
    we get:
    \[
    f'(x) - (f(x) - \sin x) = f''(x) + \sin x
    \]
    Simplifying:
    \[
    f'(x) - f(x) + \sin x = f''(x) + \sin x
    \]
    Therefore:
    \[
    f''(x) = f(x)

<explanation>The solver recognizes a pattern when they substitute the original equation back into their derived equation.

   Again, the integral from 0 to 0 is zero, so we get:
   \[
   0 = f'(0) - 1
   \]
   Therefore, \( f'(0) = 1 \).</text>
<explanation>The solver derives additional initial conditions by evaluating the differentiated equation at x=0. This shows skill in working with initial conditions by deriving them from the problem structure rather than having them explicitly given.</explanation>
