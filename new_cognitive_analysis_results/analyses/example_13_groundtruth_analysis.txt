Problem:
Joanie takes a $\$6,\!000$ loan to pay for her car.  The annual interest rate on the loan is $12\%$.  She makes no payments for 4 years, but has to pay back all the money she owes at the end of 4 years. How much more money will she owe if the interest compounds quarterly than if the interest compounds annually?  Express your answer as a dollar value to the nearest cent.

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
If the interest compounds quarterly, she owes \[\left(1 + \frac{0.12}{4}\right)^{4\cdot 4}(\$6,\!000)\approx \$9,\!628.24.\]  If it compounds annually, she owes \[(1+0.12)^4(\$6,\!000)\approx \$9,\!441.12.\]  Therefore, if the interest compounds quarterly, she owes \[\$9,\!628.24 - \$9,\!441.12 = \boxed{\$187.12}\text{ more.}\]

<text>If the interest compounds quarterly, she owes \[\left(1 + \frac{0.12}{4}\right)^{4\cdot 4}(\$6,\!000)</text>
<explanation>The solver correctly identifies and applies the compound interest formula for quarterly compounding. They use the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) where P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times compounded per year, and t is the time in years. They substitute the values correctly: P = $6,000, r = 0.12, n = 4 (quarterly), and t = 4 years.</explanation>

<start>108</start>
<end>153</end>
<text>If it compounds annually, she owes \[(1+0.12)^4(\$6,\!000)</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the compound interest formula for annual compounding. This is a variation of the same formula where n = 1 (annually). They correctly substitute the values: P = $6,000, r = 0.12, n = 1 (implied since it's annual), and t = 4 years.</explanation>

<text>\approx \$9,\!628.24.</text>
<explanation>The solver correctly computes the result of the quarterly compound interest formula. This involves raising (1 + 0.12/4) to the power of 16 and then multiplying by $6,000 to get approximately $9,628.24.</explanation>

<start>153</start>
<end>182</end>
<text>\approx \$9,\!441.12.</text>
<explanation>The solver accurately calculates the result of the annual compound interest formula. This calculation requires raising (1 + 0.12) to the power of 4 and multiplying by $6,000 to get approximately $9,441.12.</explanation>

<start>246</start>
<end>285</end>
<text>\$9,\!628.24 - \$9,\!441.12 = \boxed{\$187.12}</text>
<explanation>The solver performs the subtraction between the two computed values to find the difference between quarterly and annual compounding, calculating it to be $187.12.</explanation>

<text>If the interest compounds quarterly, she owes \[\left(1 + \frac{0.12}{4}\right)^{4\cdot 4}(\$6,\!000)\approx \$9,\!628.24.\]  If it compounds annually, she owes \[(1+0.12)^4(\$6,\!000)\approx \$9,\!441.12.</text>
<explanation>The solver decomposes the problem into two separate calculations: first determining how much would be owed with quarterly compounding, then determining how much would be owed with annual compounding. This decomposition makes the problem more manageable.</explanation>

<start>185</start>
<end>302</end>
<text>Therefore, if the interest compounds quarterly, she owes \[\$9,\!628.24 - \$9,\!441.12 = \boxed{\$187.12}\text{ more.}</text>
<explanation>After solving the two sub-problems, the solver combines the results by finding the difference between the two amounts, which directly answers the original question about how much more money would be owed with quarterly versus annual compounding.</explanation>

<explanation>The entire solution demonstrates mathematical modeling as the solver translates the loan scenario with different compounding periods into appropriate mathematical formulas.

<explanation>The solver provides the answer with the appropriate precision (to the nearest cent) as required by the problem. They also ensure they're answering exactly what was asked (the difference between quarterly and annual compounding) rather than just calculating one of the amounts.</explanation>
