Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks whether every group of order $1645$ is abelian and cyclic.
The order of the group is $n = 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 47$.
The prime factors of $n$ are $5, 7, 47$. These are distinct primes.

Let $G$ be a group of order $n = 1645$.
We can use the Sylow theorems to study the structure of $G$.

Let $n_p$ be the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$.
By Sylow's third theorem, $n_p \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ and $n_p$ divides $\frac{n}{p^k}$, where $p^k$ is the highest power of $p$ dividing $n$.

For $p=5$:
$n_5 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, so $n_5 = 1, 6, 11, \dots$
$n_5$ divides $\frac{1645}{5} = 329 = 7 \cdot 47$.
The divisors of $329$ are $1, 7, 47, 329$.
The possible values of $n_5$ are $1$.
So, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, denoted by $P_5$.
Since $P_5$ is unique, it is normal in $G$.
$|P_5| = 5$.

For $p=7$:
$n_7 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$, so $n_7 = 1, 8, 15, \dots$
$n_7$ divides $\frac{1645}{7} = 235 = 5 \cdot 47$.
The divisors of $235$ are $1, 5, 47, 235$.
The possible values of $n_7$ are $1$.
So, there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, denoted by $P_7$.
Since $P_7$ is unique, it is normal in $G$.
$|P_7| = 7$.

For $p=47$:
$n_{47} \equiv 1 \pmod{47}$, so $n_{47} = 1, 48, 95, \dots$
$n_{47}$ divides $\frac{1645}{47} = 35 = 5 \cdot 7$.
The divisors of $35$ are $1, 5, 7, 35$.
The possible values of $n_{47}$ are $1$.
So, there is a unique Sylow 47-subgroup, denoted by $P_{47}$.
Since $P_{47}$ is unique, it is normal in $G$.
$|P_{47}| = 47$.

We have normal subgroups $P_5, P_7, P_{47}$ of orders $5, 7, 47$ respectively.
Since the orders are prime, these subgroups are cyclic.
$P_5 \cong \mathbb{Z}_5$, $P_7 \cong \mathbb{Z}_7$, $P_{47} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{47}$.

Consider the subgroup $P_5 P_7$.
Since $P_7$ is normal, $P_5 P_7$ is a subgroup of $G$.
$|P_5 P_7| = \frac{|P_5| |P_7|}{|P_5 \cap P_7|}$.
Since $|P_5|=5$ and $|P_7|=7$ are coprime, $|P_5 \cap P_7| = 1$, so $P_5 \cap P_7 = \{e\}$.
$|P_5 P_7| = 5 \cdot 7 = 35$.

Since $P_5$ and $P_7$ are normal, their elements commute.
Let $x \in P_5$ and $y \in P_7$. Then $xyx^{-1}y^{-1} = (xyx^{-1})y^{-1} \in P_7$, and $xyx^{-1}y^{-1} = x(yx^{-1}y^{-1}) \in P_5$.
So $xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \in P_5 \cap P_7 = \{e\}$, which means $xyx^{-1}y^{-1} = e$, so $xy = yx$.

The subgroup $P_5 P_7$ is isomorphic to $P_5 \times P_7 \cong \mathbb{Z}_5 \times \mathbb{Z}_7$.
Since $\gcd(5, 7) = 1$, $\mathbb{Z}_5 \times \mathbb{Z}_7 \cong \mathbb{Z}_{35}$.
So, $P_5 P_7$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 35.

Now consider the subgroup $(P_5 P_7) P_{47}$.
Since $P_{47}$ is normal, this is a subgroup of $G$.
$|(P_5 P_7) P_{47}| = \frac{|P_5 P_7| |P_{47}|}{|(P_5 P_7) \cap P_{47}|}$.

Consider the intersection $(P_5 P_7) \cap P_{47}$.
The order of this intersection divides $|P_5 P_7| = 35$ and $|P_{47}| = 47$.
Since $\gcd(35, 47) = 1$, the order of the intersection is 1.
So, $(P_5 P_7) \cap P_{47} = \{e\}$.

$|(P_5 P_7) P_{47}| = \frac{35 \cdot 47}{1} = 1645 = |G|$.
This means $G = (P_5 P_7) P_{47}$.

Since $(P_5 P_7) \cap P_{47} = \{e\}$, and $P_{47}$ is normal, we have a semidirect product.
However, since $P_5 P_7$ is also normal (as it is the product of normal subgroups with trivial intersection), the product is direct.
$G = P_5 \times P_7 \times P_{47}$.

$G \cong \mathbb{Z}_5 \times \mathbb{Z}_7 \times \mathbb{Z}_{47}$.

Since the direct product of abelian groups is abelian, $G$ is abelian.

Since the orders $5, 7, 47$ are pairwise coprime,
$\mathbb{Z}_5 \times \mathbb{Z}_7 \times \mathbb{Z}_{47} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{5 \cdot 7 \cdot 47} = \mathbb{Z}_{1645}$.
So, $G$ is isomorphic to a cyclic group of order 1645.

Therefore, every group of order $1645$ is abelian and cyclic.

Generalization:
If the order of a group $G$ is $n = p_1 p_2 \dots p_k$, where $p_i$ are distinct primes, then $G$ is cyclic.

Proof of the generalization:
For each prime $p_i$, the number of Sylow $p_i$-subgroups $n_{p_i} \equiv 1 \pmod{p_i}$ and $n_{p_i}$ divides $\frac{n}{p_i} = p_1 \dots p_{i-1} p_{i+1} \dots p_k$.
Since $n_{p_i} \equiv 1 \pmod{p_i}$, $n_{p_i} = 1 + k p_i$ for some integer $k \ge 0$.
If $k \ge 1$, then $n_{p_i} \ge 1 + p_i$.
We need to show that $1 + kp_i$ cannot divide the product of the other primes.

Consider $p_1$. $n_{p_1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p_1}$, $n_{p_1}$ divides $p_2 p_3 \dots p_k$.
If $n_{p_1} > 1$, then $n_{p_1} \ge 1 + p_1$.
We need to show that $1 + p_1$ does not divide $p_2 p_3 \dots p_k$.
Since $p_1$ is the smallest prime factor, $p_1 < p_i$ for $i > 1$.
Consider the case of two distinct primes $p, q$ with $p < q$.
A group of order $pq$ has $n_p \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$, $n_p$ divides $q$, so $n_p = 1$ or $q$.
If $n_p = q$, then $q \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.
Also, $n_q \equiv 1 \pmod{q}$, $n_q$ divides $p$, so $n_q = 1$.
If $n_p = 1$, the Sylow $p$-subgroup is normal.
If $n_q = 1$, the Sylow $q$-subgroup is normal.

If $n_p = 1$, let $P$ be the normal Sylow $p$-subgroup, $|P|=p$.
Let $Q$ be a Sylow $q$-subgroup, $|Q|=q$.
$P \cap Q = \{e\}$.
$PQ$ is a subgroup of order $pq$.
$PQ = G$.
Since $P$ is normal, $G = Q \ltimes P$.
Since $|Q|=q$ is prime, $Q$ is cyclic, $Q = \langle y \rangle$.
Since $|P|=p$ is prime, $P$ is cyclic, $P = \langle x \rangle$.
The action of $Q$ on $P$ is given by a homomorphism $\phi: Q \to \text{Aut}(P)$.
$\text{Aut}(P) \cong \text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_p) \cong (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^\times$, which has order $p-1$.
The order of the image of $\phi$ divides $|Q|=q$ and $|\text{Aut}(P)| = p-1$.
Since $\gcd(q, p-1) = 1$ (because $p < q$), the order of the image is 1.
So, $\phi$ is the trivial homomorphism, meaning the action is trivial.
$yxy^{-1} = x$.
This implies that elements of $P$ and $Q$ commute.
$G \cong P \times Q \cong \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_q$.
Since $\gcd(p, q) = 1$, $\mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_q \cong \mathbb{Z}_{pq}$.
So $G$ is cyclic.

If $n_p = q$, then $q \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.
$n_q = 1$, so the Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$ is normal.
$G = P \ltimes Q$.
The action of $P$ on $Q$ is given by $\phi: P \to \text{Aut}(Q)$.
$\text{Aut}(Q) \cong \text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_q) \cong (\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})^\times$, order $q-1$.
The order of the image divides $|P|=p$ and $|\text{Aut}(Q)| = q-1$.
Since $\gcd(p, q-1) = 1$ (because $q \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ means $q = 1 + kp$, so $q-1 = kp$), unless $k=1$, $p$ does not divide $q-1$.
If $q = 1+p$, then $p=2, q=3$. Order 6. $S_3$.

Back to the case of order $n = p_1 p_2 \dots p_k$, where $p_1 < p_2 < \dots < p_k$.
Consider the Sylow $p_k$-subgroup $P_k$.
$n_{p_k} \equiv 1 \pmod{p_k}$, $n_{p_k}$ divides $p_1 p_2 \dots p_{k-1}$.
If $n_{p_k} > 1$, then $n_{p_k} \ge 1 + p_k$.
But $1 + p_k$ cannot divide $p_1 p_2 \dots p_{k-1}$ because $p_k$ is the largest prime.
So $n_{p_k} = 1$, and $P_k$ is normal.

Consider the group $G / P_k$, which has order $p_1 p_2 \dots p_{k-1}$.
By induction, $G / P_k$ has a normal Sylow $p_{k-1}$-subgroup.
This corresponds to a normal subgroup of $G$ of order $p_{k-1}$.

Let's use a different approach.
Consider the case of three distinct primes $p < q < r$.
Order $pqr$.

Sylow $r$-subgroup $R$, $|R|=r$, $n_r = 1$. $R$ is normal.
Consider $G/R$, order $pq$.
$G/R$ is cyclic, so all its subgroups are normal.

Sylow $q$-subgroup of $G$, $Q$, $|Q|=q$.
$n_q$ divides $pr$, $n_q \equiv 1 \pmod{q}$.
$n_q = 1$ or $p$ or $r$ or $pr$.
If $n_q = p$, then $p \equiv 1 \pmod{q}$, impossible since $p < q$.
If $n_q = r$, then $r \equiv 1 \pmod{q}$.
If $n_q = pr$, then $pr \equiv 1 \pmod{q}$.

Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, $P$, $|P|=p$.
$n_p$ divides $qr$, $n_p \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.
$n_p = 1$ or $q$ or $r$ or $qr$.
If $n_p = q$, then $q \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.
If $n_p = r$, then $r \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.
If $n_p = qr$, then $qr \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.

In our case, $p=5, q=7, r=47$.
$n_{47} = 1$. Sylow 47-subgroup is normal, $P_{47}$.
$G / P_{47}$ has order $5 \cdot 7 = 35$.
A group of order $pq$ with $p < q$ has a normal Sylow $q$-subgroup.
If $p$ does not divide $q-1$, then both Sylow subgroups are normal, and the group is cyclic.
Here, $5$ does not divide $7-1 = 6$.
The Sylow 7-subgroup of $G / P_{47}$ is normal.
This corresponds to a subgroup $H$ of $G$ containing $P_{47}$, such that $H / P_{47}$ is the Sylow 7-subgroup of $G / P_{47}$, order 7.
$|H| = 7 \cdot 47$.
The Sylow 7-subgroup of $G$ is normal.

Let the Sylow subgroups be $P_5, P_7, P_{47}$.
We found that they are all normal.
Consider $P_5 P_7 P_{47}$.
Since the subgroups are normal, and their pairwise intersections are trivial,
$P_5 P_7 P_{47} \cong P_5 \times P_7 \times P_{47}$.
The order of this subgroup is $|P_5| |P_7| |P_{47}| = 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 47 = 1645 = |G|$.
So $G = P_5 \times P_7 \times P_{47}$.

$P_5 \cong \mathbb{Z}_5$, $P_7 \cong \mathbb{Z}_7$, $P_{47} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{47}$.
$G \cong \mathbb{Z}_5 \times \mathbb{Z}_7 \times \mathbb{Z}_{47}$.
Since $\gcd(5, 7) = 1$, $\mathbb{Z}_5 \times \mathbb{Z}_7 \cong \mathbb{Z}_{35}$.
$G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{35} \times \mathbb{Z}_{47}$.
Since $\gcd(35, 47) = 1$, $\mathbb{Z}_{35} \times \mathbb{Z}_{47} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{35 \cdot 47} = \mathbb{Z}_{1645}$.

So, $G$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 1645.
A cyclic group is abelian.

The statement is true.

Just need to be careful about the phrasing of the question.
"Every group of order $5\cdot7\cdot47=1645$ is abelian, and cyclic."

We have shown that any group of this order is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{1645}$.
Therefore, every such group is abelian and cyclic.

Formal proof structure:
Let $G$ be a group of order $1645 = 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 47$.
Use Sylow theorems to show that the Sylow 5, 7, 47-subgroups are normal.
Let these be $P_5, P_7, P_{47}$.
Show that $G = P_5 P_7 P_{47}$ and the product is direct.
$G \cong P_5 \times P_7 \times P_{47}$.
Since the orders are prime, $P_5 \cong \mathbb{Z}_5$, $P_7 \cong \mathbb{Z}_7$, $P_{47} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{47}$.
$G \cong \mathbb{Z}_5 \times \mathbb{Z}_7 \times \mathbb{Z}_{47}$.
Since the orders are pairwise coprime, $G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{5 \cdot 7 \cdot 47} = \mathbb{Z}_{1645}$.
The group $\mathbb{Z}_{1645}$ is cyclic, and cyclic groups are abelian.
Therefore, every group of order 1645 is abelian and cyclic.

The statement is true.

Consider a potential counterexample or edge case.
If the prime factors were not distinct, or if the conditions for normality of Sylow subgroups were not met, the conclusion might be different.

Example: Group of order $p^2$, where $p$ is prime. It is abelian.
Group of order $pq$, $p < q$. If $p$ divides $q-1$, there can be non-abelian groups.
Example: Order 6, $2 \cdot 3$. $S_3$ is non-abelian. $3 \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$.

The key here is that the primes are distinct, and the smaller primes do not divide one less than the larger primes.
$5$ does not divide $7-1=6$ or $47-1=46$.
$7$ does not divide $47-1=46$.

Final check of the question: "Every group of order $5\cdot7\cdot47=1645$ is abelian, and cyclic."
The statement claims both properties. Our result confirms both.

<text>Now consider the subgroup $(P_5 P_7) P_{47}$.
Since $P_{47}$ is normal, this is a subgroup of $G$.
$|(P_5 P_7) P_{47}| = \frac{|P_5 P_7| |P_{47}|}{|(P_5 P_7) \cap P_{47}|}$.

Consider the intersection $(P_5 P_7) \cap P_{47}$.
The order of this intersection divides $|P_5 P_7| = 35$ and $|P_{47}| = 47$.
Since $\gcd(35, 47) = 1$, the order of the intersection is 1.
So, $(P_5 P_7) \cap P_{47} = \{e\}$.

$|(P_5 P_7) P_{47}| = \frac{35 \cdot 47}{1} = 1645 = |G|$.
This means $G = (P_5 P_7) P_{47}$.

Since $(P_5 P_7) \cap P_{47} = \{e\}$, and $P_{47}$ is normal, we have a semidirect product.
However, since $P_5 P_7$ is also normal (as it is the product of normal subgroups with trivial intersection), the product is direct.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses mathematical reasoning to analyze the structure of the entire group, applying principles about group orders, intersections, and normality to deduce the overall group structure.</explanation>

<text>Since the orders $5, 7, 47$ are pairwise coprime,
$\mathbb{Z}_5 \times \mathbb{Z}_7 \times \mathbb{Z}_{47} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{5 \cdot 7 \cdot 47} = \mathbb{Z}_{1645}$.
So, $G$ is isomorphic to a cyclic group of order 1645.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses mathematical reasoning to establish that the direct product of cyclic groups with pairwise coprime orders is isomorphic to a single cyclic group, applying fundamental principles from group theory.</explanation>

<text>Therefore, every group of order $1645$ is abelian and cyclic.

Generalization:
If the order of a group $G$ is $n = p_1 p_2 \dots p_k$, where $p_i$ are distinct primes, then $G$ is cyclic.</text>
<explanation>After solving the specific problem, the solver recognizes a pattern and attempts to generalize the result to all groups whose order is a product of distinct primes, showing the ability to abstract from the specific case.</explanation>

<text>Proof of the generalization:
For each prime $p_i$, the number of Sylow $p_i$-subgroups $n_{p_i} \equiv 1 \pmod{p_i}$ and $n_{p_i}$ divides $\frac{n}{p_i} = p_1 \dots p_{i-1} p_{i+1} \dots p_k$.
Since $n_{p_i} \equiv 1 \pmod{p_i}$, $n_{p_i} = 1 + k p_i$ for some integer $k \ge 0$.
If $k \ge 1$, then $n_{p_i} \ge 1 + p_i$.
We need to show that $1 + kp_i$ cannot divide the product of the other primes.</text>
