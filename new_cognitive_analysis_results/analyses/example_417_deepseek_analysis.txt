Problem:
A biologist wants to calculate the number of fish in a lake. On May 1 she catches a random sample of 60 fish, tags them, and releases them. On September 1 she catches a random sample of 70 fish and finds that 3 of them are tagged. To calculate the number of fish in the lake on May 1, she assumes that  $25\%$  of these fish are no longer in the lake on September 1 (because of death and emigrations), that  $40\%$  of the fish were not in the lake May 1 (because of births and immigrations), and that the number of untagged fish and tagged fish in the September 1 sample are representative of the total population. What does the biologist calculate for the number of fish in the lake on May 1?

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, let's see. The biologist wants to estimate the number of fish in the lake on May 1. She uses the capture-recapture method, but with some adjustments for fish that left the lake and new fish that entered. Hmm.

First, on May 1, she catches 60 fish, tags them, and releases them back. Then, on September 1, she catches another sample of 70 fish, and out of those, 3 are tagged. So, normally, without any changes in the population, we could use the Lincoln-Petersen estimator. That formula is usually (number tagged in first catch * total number in second catch) / number tagged in second catch. So that would be (60 * 70) / 3 = 1400. But wait, there are some adjustments here.

The problem states that 25% of the original fish from May 1 are no longer in the lake by September 1. So that means 75% remain. Also, 40% of the fish in September were not there in May, due to births and immigrations. So the September population has two components: 60% are original fish (from May) and 40% are new fish. 

Let me parse this step by step. Let's denote N as the number of fish in the lake on May 1. 

First, by September 1, 25% of these N fish are gone, so remaining original fish are 0.75N. 

Additionally, there are new fish that make up 40% of the September population. Let the total September population be T. So, 40% of T are new fish, and 60% of T are original fish. Therefore, original fish in September: 0.6T, and new fish: 0.4T.

But we also know that original fish in September are 0.75N. Therefore, 0.6T = 0.75N. So, T = (0.75 / 0.6) N = (75 / 60) N = (5 / 4) N = 1.25N. Hence, total September population is 1.25N. So, 40% of that, which is 0.4 * 1.25N = 0.5N, are new fish. Wait, that's interesting.

So total fish in September: 0.75N (original) + 0.5N (new) = 1.25N. Okay, so T = 1.25N.

But how does this affect the recapture rate? The tagged fish are only in the original population. Since new fish weren't there in May, they can't be tagged. So the 3 tagged fish found in September must come from the original 0.75N fish. 

Wait, no, the original fish on September 1 are 0.75N. So, of the 70 fish caught in September, 3 were tagged. These tagged fish have to come from the original remaining population. But the total fish in September is 1.25N, as calculated.

So proportionally, the number of tagged fish in September is (number of tagged fish remaining) / total September population. Number of tagged fish remaining: originally 60 were tagged, but 25% of the original fish died. Does that mean that 25% of the tagged fish also died? Hmm, the problem says 25% of the original fish are no longer in the lake. So, assuming that the tagged fish are a random sample, then 25% of the tagged fish would have left too. Therefore, the remaining tagged fish would be 75% of 60, which is 0.75 * 60 = 45.

Wait, but actually, the problem states 25% of the original fish are no longer in the lake. So if the original population is N, then the original fish remaining are 0.75N. The 60 tagged fish are part of the original N, so the same 25% reduction would apply to them. Therefore, tagged fish remaining would be 60 - 25% of 60 = 60 - 15 = 45. So in the September population, the number of tagged fish is 45, and the total September population is 1.25N.

Therefore, the proportion of tagged fish in September is 45 / 1.25N. 

But in the second catch of 70 fish, the proportion of tagged fish is 3/70. Assuming that the sample is representative, the proportion in the sample should equal the proportion in the total population. So,

45 / 1.25N = 3 / 70

Solving for N:

45 / 1.25N = 3 / 70

Multiply both sides by 1.25N:

45 = (3 / 70) * 1.25N

Multiply both sides by 70:

45 * 70 = 3 * 1.25N

3150 = 3.75N

Divide both sides by 3.75:

N = 3150 / 3.75

Calculate that:

3150 divided by 3.75. Let's compute 3150 divided by 3.75.

First, note that 3.75 is equal to 15/4, so dividing by 15/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/15.

Therefore, N = 3150 * (4/15) = (3150 / 15) * 4

Compute 3150 divided by 15:

15*200=3000, so 3150 -3000=150, so 150/15=10. So total is 200+10=210.

Therefore, 210*4=840.

Therefore, N=840.

Wait, let me check that again. Maybe using decimal division:

3150 รท 3.75

Multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimal:

3150 *100 / 375 = 315000 /375

Dividing 315000 by 375:

375 * 800 = 300,000

Subtract 300,000 from 315,000: 15,000

375*40=15,000

So total is 800+40=840. Yep, same result.

So N=840.

Therefore, the estimated number of fish in the lake on May 1 is 840.

But let me verify again. Because sometimes when you have changing populations, the Lincoln-Petersen estimator might need adjustments.

Wait, traditional capture-recapture formula is:

N = (M * C) / R

Where M is the number marked in first capture, C is total number in second capture, R is the number recaptured. But in the traditional formula, it assumes closed population. Here, the population is not closed; there's been mortality and immigration.

But in the problem, the biologist is using her own method considering these factors.

She assumes that 25% of original fish are gone, so the original surviving fish are 0.75N. The total September population is 1.25N as per her estimates (since 40% are new, which is relative to September's population). However, marked fish remaining are 0.75 * 60 = 45. So proportion of marked fish in September is 45 / 1.25N. In the sample, 3/70 are marked, so equating these proportions gives 45 over 1.25N equals 3 over 70, leading to N=840. This seems consistent.

Alternatively, the total September population is 1.25N. Of those, 60% are original, which would be 0.75N. Since the original surviving fish are 0.75N, then indeed 1.25N * 0.6 = 0.75N, checks out. The 45 tagged fish are part of these 0.75N original.

Therefore, the population proportion of tagged fish is 45 / 1.25N, and the sample had 3/70, so setting 45/(1.25N) = 3/70 gives 3.75N = 3150 as above, N=840. Seems correct.

I think that is it. Let me just think if there's another way someone might approach it, perhaps mistakenly, and get a different answer. For instance, if one forgets about the population changes and just uses the basic Lincoln-Petersen: 60*70/3=1400. But because 25% died and 40% are new, it's necessary to adjust. The biologist uses the assumptions to adjust. So accounting for the changes, the number should be 840.

Yeah, so unless I messed up in the calculation steps, but when I redid the calculation through fractions and decimal division, got the same result. So probably correct. Guess the answer is 840.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{840}

<text>Let me parse this step by step. Let's denote N as the number of fish in the lake on May 1. 

First, by September 1, 25% of these N fish are gone, so remaining original fish are 0.75N. 

Additionally, there are new fish that make up 40% of the September population. Let the total September population be T. So, 40% of T are new fish, and 60% of T are original fish. Therefore, original fish in September: 0.6T, and new fish: 0.4T.</text>
<explanation>The solver is translating the verbal problem into mathematical variables and relationships.

<text>Therefore, the proportion of tagged fish in September is 45 / 1.25N. 

But in the second catch of 70 fish, the proportion of tagged fish is 3/70. Assuming that the sample is representative, the proportion in the sample should equal the proportion in the total population.</text>

<explanation>The solver uses proportional reasoning to relate the September population (T) to the May population (N). They recognize that if 60% of T equals 75% of N, then T must be 1.25N.

<start>3536</start>
<end>3982</end>
<text>But let me verify again. Because sometimes when you have changing populations, the Lincoln-Petersen estimator might need adjustments.

Wait, traditional capture-recapture formula is:

N = (M * C) / R

Where M is the number marked in first capture, C is total number in second capture, R is the number recaptured. But in the traditional formula, it assumes closed population. Here, the population is not closed; there's been mortality and immigration.</text>
<explanation>The solver shows metacognitive awareness by questioning whether the traditional formula applies in this case.

She assumes that 25% of original fish are gone, so the original surviving fish are 0.75N.

So proportion of marked fish in September is 45 / 1.25N. In the sample, 3/70 are marked, so equating these proportions gives 45 over 1.25N equals 3 over 70, leading to N=840.

<text>Alternatively, the total September population is 1.25N. Of those, 60% are original, which would be 0.75N. Since the original surviving fish are 0.75N, then indeed 1.25N * 0.6 = 0.75N, checks out. The 45 tagged fish are part of these 0.75N original.</text>

<definition>The ability to methodically set up and solve equations by applying algebraic principles in a step-by-step manner.</definition>

<start>2098</start>
<end>2296</end>
<text>So,

45 / 1.25N = 3 / 70

Solving for N:

45 / 1.25N = 3 / 70

Multiply both sides by 1.25N:

45 = (3 / 70) * 1.25N

Multiply both sides by 70:

<text>3150 = 3.75N

Divide both sides by 3.75:

N = 3150 / 3.75

Calculate that:

3150 divided by 3.75. Let's compute 3150 divided by 3.75.</text>

<definition>The ability to perform calculations using multiple approaches or methods, adapting strategies based on the specific numerical values involved.</definition>

<start>2443</start>
<end>2672</end>
<text>First, note that 3.75 is equal to 15/4, so dividing by 15/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/15.

Therefore, N = 3150 * (4/15) = (3150 / 15) * 4

Compute 3150 divided by 15:

15*200=3000, so 3150 -3000=150, so 150/15=10. So total is 200+10=210.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates computational flexibility by converting the decimal division into an equivalent fraction operation.

Subtract 300,000 from 315,000: 15,000

375*40=15,000

So total is 800+40=840. Yep, same result.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses a different computational approach to verify their answer, showing flexibility in calculation methods.
