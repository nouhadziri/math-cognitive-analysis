<explanation>The solver appears to have recognized a pattern in the remainders when numbers with repeated 9's are multiplied and divided by 1000. While the trajectory is extremely concise, arriving at 109 as the answer suggests the solver identified a pattern in how these products behave modulo 1000.</explanation>

<explanation>Arriving at the specific remainder of 109 demonstrates strong number sense, particularly understanding how numbers with repeated 9's behave in modular arithmetic. The solver likely understood that each term in the product would contribute in a specific way to the final remainder when divided by 1000.</explanation>

<explanation>The extremely concise answer suggests the solver found an efficient approach to this problem. Rather than attempting to compute the entire massive product, they likely recognized that only the last three digits (the remainder when divided by 1000) matter, and found a way to track how these digits evolve through the multiplication process.</explanation>
