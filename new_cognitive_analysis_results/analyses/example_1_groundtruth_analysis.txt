Problem:
Let  $ \mathcal{H}$  be an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, let  $ d>0$ , and suppose that  $ S$  is a set of points (not necessarily countable) in  $ \mathcal{H}$  such that the distance between any two distinct points in  $ S$  is equal to  $ d$ . Show that there is a point  $ y\in\mathcal{H}$  such that 
\[ \left\{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x\minus{}y): \ x\in S\right\}\]
is an orthonormal system of vectors in  $ \mathcal{H}$ .

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Consider a countable subset \( S_0 \subseteq S \)**:
   Let \( S_0 = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots\} \) be a countable subset of \( S \). Since \( S \) is a set of points in \( \mathcal{H} \) such that the distance between any two distinct points is \( d \), the same property holds for \( S_0 \).

2. **Find a point \( y \) for \( S_0 \)**:
   We need to find a point \( y \in \mathcal{H} \) such that the set 
   \[
   \left\{ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x_i - y) : x_i \in S_0 \right\}
   \]
   is an orthonormal system. 

   Define \( e_i = x_i - y \) for each \( i \). We want \( \left\{ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i \right\} \) to be an orthonormal system. This requires:
   \[
   \left\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_j \right\rangle = \delta_{ij}
   \]
   where \( \delta_{ij} \) is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if \( i = j \) and 0 otherwise.

3. **Norm condition**:
   For the vectors to be orthonormal, each vector must have norm 1:
   \[
   \left\| \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i \right\| = 1 \implies \left\| e_i \right\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   Since \( \|x_i - y\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} \), we need to choose \( y \) such that this condition holds.

4. **Orthogonality condition**:
   For orthogonality, we need:
   \[
   \left\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_j \right\rangle = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad i \neq j
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \left\langle e_i, e_j \right\rangle = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad i \neq j
   \]
   Since \( \|x_i - x_j\| = d \) for \( i \neq j \), we have:
   \[
   \|e_i - e_j\| = d
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \|x_i - y - (x_j - y)\| = d \implies \|x_i - x_j\| = d
   \]
   which is already given.

5. **Generalization to \( S \)**:
   Now, consider any \( x \in S \). We need to show that \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x - y) \) also has norm 1 and is orthogonal to all \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x_i - y) \).

   Let \( e = x - y \). We need:
   \[
   \left\| \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e \right\| = 1 \implies \|e\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   and for orthogonality:
   \[
   \left\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i \right\rangle = 0 \quad \text{for all} \quad i
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \left\langle e, e_i \right\rangle = 0 \quad \text{for all} \quad i
   \]

6. **Verification**:
   Since \( \|x - x_i\| = d \) for all \( x_i \in S_0 \), we have:
   \[
   \|e - e_i\| = d \implies \|x - y - (x_i - y)\| = d \implies \|x - x_i\| = d
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \|e\|^2 = \|e_i\|^2 = \frac{d^2}{2}
   \]
   and:
   \[
   \left\langle e, e_i \right\rangle = 0
   \]
   Thus, \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x - y) \) is orthogonal to all \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x_i - y) \) and has norm 1.

Therefore, the set 
\[
\left\{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x - y) : x \in S\right\}
\]
is an orthonormal system in \( \mathcal{H} \).

<explanation>The solver begins by decomposing the problem by considering a countable subset S₀ of S. This is a strategic simplification that makes the problem more tractable while preserving the essential properties needed for the solution. This approach allows the solver to work with a more manageable set before generalizing back to the original problem.</explanation>

<start>190</start>

<text>2. **Find a point \( y \) for \( S_0 \)**:
   We need to find a point \( y \in \mathcal{H} \) such that the set 
   \[
   \left\{ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x_i - y) : x_i \in S_0 \right\}
   \]
   is an orthonormal system. 

   Define \( e_i = x_i - y \) for each \( i \). We want \( \left\{ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i \right\} \) to be an orthonormal system. This requires:
   \[
   \left\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_j \right\rangle = \delta_{ij}
   \]
   where \( \delta_{ij} \) is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if \( i = j \) and 0 otherwise.</text>
<explanation>The solver further decomposes the problem by identifying that they need to find a specific point y and then translating the orthonormality requirement into mathematical conditions. This decomposition allows them to address the specific mathematical requirements separately.</explanation>

   \[
   \left\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_j \right\rangle = \delta_{ij}
   \]
   where \( \delta_{ij} \) is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if \( i = j \) and 0 otherwise.</text>
<explanation>The solver introduces formal notation (e_i = x_i - y) and expresses the orthonormality condition using inner product notation and the Kronecker delta. This precise mathematical formulation transforms the problem into a set of equations that can be manipulated and solved.</explanation>

<start>764</start>
<end>982</end>
<text>3. **Norm condition**:
   For the vectors to be orthonormal, each vector must have norm 1:
   \[
   \left\| \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i \right\| = 1 \implies \left\| e_i \right\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   Since \( \|x_i - y\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} \), we need to choose \( y \) such that this condition holds.</text>
<explanation>The solver formally expresses the normalization condition using norm notation and algebraically manipulates it to derive a specific constraint on the distance between points x_i and y. This mathematical representation helps clarify what properties the solution must satisfy.</explanation>

<definition>Identifying and carefully analyzing the conditions that must be satisfied for a solution, breaking them down into their components and understanding their implications.</definition>

<text>3. **Norm condition**:
   For the vectors to be orthonormal, each vector must have norm 1:
   \[
   \left\| \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i \right\| = 1 \implies \left\| e_i \right\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   Since \( \|x_i - y\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} \), we need to choose \( y \) such that this condition holds.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes the normalization condition for orthonormal vectors, deriving a specific constraint on the distance between points. This analysis breaks down one of the two key conditions for orthonormality (unit norm).</explanation>

<start>983</start>
<end>1370</end>
<text>4. **Orthogonality condition**:
   For orthogonality, we need:
   \[
   \left\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_j \right\rangle = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad i \neq j
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \left\langle e_i, e_j \right\rangle = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad i \neq j
   \]
   Since \( \|x_i - x_j\| = d \) for \( i \neq j \), we have:
   \[
   \|e_i - e_j\| = d
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \|x_i - y - (x_j - y)\| = d \implies \|x_i - x_j\| = d
   \]
   which is already given.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes the orthogonality condition, which is the second key requirement for orthonormality. They express it mathematically and connect it to the given property that distinct points in S are at distance d from each other. This analysis shows how the solver systematically examines each condition that must be satisfied.</explanation>

<text>5. **Generalization to \( S \)**:
   Now, consider any \( x \in S \). We need to show that \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x - y) \) also has norm 1 and is orthogonal to all \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x_i - y) \).

   Let \( e = x - y \). We need:
   \[
   \left\| \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e \right\| = 1 \implies \|e\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   and for orthogonality:
   \[
   \left\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i \right\rangle = 0 \quad \text{for all} \quad i
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \left\langle e, e_i \right\rangle = 0 \quad \text{for all} \quad i
   \]</text>
<explanation>After developing the solution for the countable subset S₀, the solver strategically generalizes to the entire set S. They recognize that the same principles apply and explicitly state what needs to be verified for the generalization to be valid. This demonstrates the ability to extend a solution from a specific case to the general case.</explanation>

<definition>Systematically checking that a proposed solution satisfies all the required conditions and constraints of the problem.</definition>

<start>1801</start>
<end>2296</end>
<text>6. **Verification**:
   Since \( \|x - x_i\| = d \) for all \( x_i \in S_0 \), we have:
   \[
   \|e - e_i\| = d \implies \|x - y - (x_i - y)\| = d \implies \|x - x_i\| = d
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \|e\|^2 = \|e_i\|^2 = \frac{d^2}{2}
   \]
   and:
   \[
   \left\langle e, e_i \right\rangle = 0
   \]
   Thus, \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x - y) \) is orthogonal to all \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x_i - y) \) and has norm 1.</text>
<explanation>The solver methodically verifies that the proposed solution satisfies all the required conditions. They check that the vectors have the correct norm and are orthogonal to each other, confirming that the mathematical requirements for an orthonormal system are met. This verification step is crucial for ensuring the correctness of the solution.</explanation>

<skill>Vector Space Reasoning</skill>

<text>Define \( e_i = x_i - y \) for each \( i \). We want \( \left\{ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i \right\} \) to be an orthonormal system. This requires:

   \left\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_j \right\rangle = \delta_{ij}
   \]
   where \( \delta_{ij} \) is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if \( i = j \) and 0 otherwise.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates understanding of vector space concepts by expressing orthonormality in terms of inner products and using the Kronecker delta notation. This shows facility with the mathematical structures of Hilbert spaces.</explanation>

<start>983</start>
<end>1370</end>
<text>4. **Orthogonality condition**:
   For orthogonality, we need:
   \[
   \left\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_j \right\rangle = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad i \neq j
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \left\langle e_i, e_j \right\rangle = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad i \neq j
   \]
   Since \( \|x_i - x_j\| = d \) for \( i \neq j \), we have:
   \[
   \|e_i - e_j\| = d
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \|x_i - y - (x_j - y)\| = d \implies \|x_i - x_j\| = d
   \]
   which is already given.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies vector space properties to connect the orthogonality condition with the distance property given in the problem. They manipulate vector expressions and use the relationship between inner products and norms to derive the necessary conditions.</explanation>

<skill>Geometric Insight</skill>
<definition>Using spatial and geometric intuition to understand mathematical relationships, particularly in vector spaces where concepts like distance, orthogonality, and projection have geometric interpretations.</definition>

<start>1801</start>
<end>2296</end>
<text>6. **Verification**:
   Since \( \|x - x_i\| = d \) for all \( x_i \in S_0 \), we have:
   \[
   \|e - e_i\| = d \implies \|x - y - (x_i - y)\| = d \implies \|x - x_i\| = d
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \|e\|^2 = \|e_i\|^2 = \frac{d^2}{2}
   \]
   and:
   \[
   \left\langle e, e_i \right\rangle = 0
   \]
   Thus, \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x - y) \) is orthogonal to all \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x_i - y) \) and has norm 1.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses geometric insight to connect the distance property between points to the orthogonality of vectors. They understand that vectors of equal norm whose difference has a specific norm must be orthogonal, which is a geometric property in Hilbert spaces. This geometric understanding helps them verify the solution.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Inference</skill>
<definition>Drawing logical conclusions from given mathematical statements and previously established results to derive new mathematical facts.</definition>

<start>1801</start>
<end>2296</end>
<text>6. **Verification**:
   Since \( \|x - x_i\| = d \) for all \( x_i \in S_0 \), we have:
   \[
   \|e - e_i\| = d \implies \|x - y - (x_i - y)\| = d \implies \|x - x_i\| = d
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \|e\|^2 = \|e_i\|^2 = \frac{d^2}{2}
   \]
   and:
   \[
   \left\langle e, e_i \right\rangle = 0
   \]
   Thus, \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x - y) \) is orthogonal to all \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x_i - y) \) and has norm 1.</text>
<explanation>The solver makes a key inference from the distance property to derive the orthogonality of vectors. They use the fact that if two vectors have equal norm and their difference has a specific norm, then they must be orthogonal. This inference is crucial for establishing that the system is orthonormal.</explanation>
