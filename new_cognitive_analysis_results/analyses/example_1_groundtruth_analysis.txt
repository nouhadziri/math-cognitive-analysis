Problem:
Let  $ \mathcal{H}$  be an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, let  $ d>0$ , and suppose that  $ S$  is a set of points (not necessarily countable) in  $ \mathcal{H}$  such that the distance between any two distinct points in  $ S$  is equal to  $ d$ . Show that there is a point  $ y\in\mathcal{H}$  such that 
\[ \left\{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x\minus{}y): \ x\in S\right\}\]
is an orthonormal system of vectors in  $ \mathcal{H}$ .

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Consider a countable subset \( S_0 \subseteq S \)**:
   Let \( S_0 = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots\} \) be a countable subset of \( S \). Since \( S \) is a set of points in \( \mathcal{H} \) such that the distance between any two distinct points is \( d \), the same property holds for \( S_0 \).

2. **Find a point \( y \) for \( S_0 \)**:
   We need to find a point \( y \in \mathcal{H} \) such that the set 
   \[
   \left\{ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x_i - y) : x_i \in S_0 \right\}
   \]
   is an orthonormal system. 

   Define \( e_i = x_i - y \) for each \( i \). We want \( \left\{ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i \right\} \) to be an orthonormal system. This requires:
   \[
   \left\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_j \right\rangle = \delta_{ij}
   \]
   where \( \delta_{ij} \) is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if \( i = j \) and 0 otherwise.

3. **Norm condition**:
   For the vectors to be orthonormal, each vector must have norm 1:
   \[
   \left\| \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i \right\| = 1 \implies \left\| e_i \right\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   Since \( \|x_i - y\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} \), we need to choose \( y \) such that this condition holds.

4. **Orthogonality condition**:
   For orthogonality, we need:
   \[
   \left\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_j \right\rangle = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad i \neq j
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \left\langle e_i, e_j \right\rangle = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad i \neq j
   \]
   Since \( \|x_i - x_j\| = d \) for \( i \neq j \), we have:
   \[
   \|e_i - e_j\| = d
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \|x_i - y - (x_j - y)\| = d \implies \|x_i - x_j\| = d
   \]
   which is already given.

5. **Generalization to \( S \)**:
   Now, consider any \( x \in S \). We need to show that \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x - y) \) also has norm 1 and is orthogonal to all \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x_i - y) \).

   Let \( e = x - y \). We need:
   \[
   \left\| \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e \right\| = 1 \implies \|e\| = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   and for orthogonality:
   \[
   \left\langle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d} e_i \right\rangle = 0 \quad \text{for all} \quad i
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \left\langle e, e_i \right\rangle = 0 \quad \text{for all} \quad i
   \]

6. **Verification**:
   Since \( \|x - x_i\| = d \) for all \( x_i \in S_0 \), we have:
   \[
   \|e - e_i\| = d \implies \|x - y - (x_i - y)\| = d \implies \|x - x_i\| = d
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \|e\|^2 = \|e_i\|^2 = \frac{d^2}{2}
   \]
   and:
   \[
   \left\langle e, e_i \right\rangle = 0
   \]
   Thus, \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x - y) \) is orthogonal to all \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x_i - y) \) and has norm 1.

Therefore, the set 
\[
\left\{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x - y) : x \in S\right\}
\]
is an orthonormal system in \( \mathcal{H} \).
