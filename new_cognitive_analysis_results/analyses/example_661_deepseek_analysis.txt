Problem:
An ellipse has foci at $(9, 20)$ and $(49, 55)$ in the $xy$ -plane and is tangent to the $x$ -axis. What is the length of its major axis?

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to find the length of the major axis of an ellipse that has foci at (9, 20) and (49, 55) and is tangent to the x-axis. Hmm, let me recall. An ellipse has two foci, and the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to the major axis length, right? So, if the ellipse is tangent to the x-axis, that means it touches the x-axis at exactly one point. That point of tangency must be the closest the ellipse gets to the x-axis. Since the x-axis is tangent to the ellipse, that point of contact would lie on the x-axis, so its y-coordinate must be 0. Let me try to visualize this.

So, first, I should note the coordinates of the foci: F1 is at (9, 20) and F2 is at (49, 55). The ellipse is tangent to the x-axis, so there exists some point (a, 0) on the x-axis that lies on the ellipse. The key property of an ellipse is that for any point P on the ellipse, the sum of the distances from P to F1 and F2 is constant and equal to the major axis length, which is 2a, where a is the semi-major axis length. Therefore, if I can find the distance from (a, 0) to F1 and F2 and sum them, that should equal the major axis length. Additionally, since (a, 0) is the point of tangency, it's likely the closest point on the ellipse to the x-axis, but I need to ensure this. Wait, actually, maybe for a general ellipse, the closest point might not be along the major axis, but since it's tangent, it's only touching at one point. 

Alternatively, maybe another approach: in conic sections, the tangent line at a point on the ellipse has a certain relation to the foci. I recall the reflection property: that the tangent line at any point on the ellipse makes equal angles with the lines from the two foci to that point. So, if the ellipse is tangent to the x-axis at some point (a, 0), then the x-axis (which is the tangent line there) should satisfy the reflection property. That is, the angle between the tangent line and the line from (a,0) to F1 is equal to the angle between the tangent line and the line from (a,0) to F2. Since the tangent line is the x-axis, which is horizontal, the angles in question would be the angles that the lines from F1 and F2 to (a,0) make with the horizontal.

Alternatively, maybe since the tangent line is horizontal, the reflection property would imply that the two foci are symmetrically placed with respect to the tangent line? Wait, no, reflection across the tangent line. If the tangent line is the x-axis, reflecting F1 over the x-axis should lie on the line connecting F2 and the point of tangency. Wait, I remember that the reflection property of ellipses: the tangent at any point bisects the angle between the lines to the two foci. Hmm, maybe I need to use the fact that the tangent at (a,0) is the x-axis, so the normal line at that point is vertical. But perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe use calculus. Suppose the ellipse is tangent to the x-axis at (a, 0). Then, the ellipse equation can be written in standard form, but since the foci are not aligned with the axes, it's a rotated ellipse, which makes it complicated. Hmm. Rotated ellipses are a bit tricky because they have cross terms. But maybe there's another way without writing the equation of the ellipse.

Wait, another thought. The distance from the center of the ellipse to the tangent line (x-axis) is equal to the semi-minor axis length. Wait, no, that is the case for an ellipse tangent to a line, but only if the tangent line is parallel to the major or minor axis. Since this is a general ellipse, possibly rotated, the semi-minor axis might not directly relate to the distance from the center. Hmmm.

Alternatively, think about the general definition of an ellipse as the set of points where the sum of distances to the two foci is constant. So, if the ellipse is tangent to the x-axis, there is exactly one point (a, 0) on the x-axis that belongs to the ellipse. For that point, the sum of distances to F1 and F2 is equal to the major axis length, which is 2a (but don't confuse this 'a' with the x-coordinate; same symbol). Maybe notation conflict. Let's denote the semi-major axis length as 's', then major axis is 2s. Wait, but the problem says "length of its major axis," so just 2s. Maybe call the major axis length L, which is equal to 2s. So, in that case, L is the sum of distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci. In particular, for the point (a, 0), this sum is L.

Therefore, if I can find the point (a, 0) such that the sum of distances from (a, 0) to F1 and F2 is minimized? Wait, no, the sum is constant. But if there's only one such point on the x-axis, that would mean that the x-axis is tangent to the ellipse, so there's exactly one solution to the system of the ellipse and the x-axis. Wait, but the x-axis is y=0, so substituting y=0 into the ellipse equation, there's exactly one solution. But since the ellipse is not necessarily axis-aligned, it's complicated.

Wait, maybe parametrize this: The ellipse is tangent to x-axis at (a,0), so substituting y=0, there's a unique solution. The ellipse equation can be written in terms of the two foci. But the general equation of an ellipse with foci at F1 and F2 is: for any point P, |PF1| + |PF2| = L. So, if we take P as (a,0), then |(a,0) - (9,20)| + |(a,0) - (49,55)| = L. Since it's the only point on the x-axis, we need that the equation sqrt{(x - 9)^2 + (20)^2} + sqrt{(x - 49)^2 + (55)^2} = L has exactly one solution. That happens when the ellipse is tangent to the x-axis, so this equation has a single solution for x. How do we find a such that the equation has only one solution?

This is similar to the problem where we have the sum of two square roots equal to a constant, and we want that equation to have exactly one solution for x. So, minima and maxima. Maybe think that the minimal value of the sum sqrt{(x - 9)^2 + 400} + sqrt{(x - 49)^2 + 3025} is achieved when the derivative with respect to x is zero. If the ellipse is tangent to the x-axis, then the minimal value of this sum is achieved at the point (a,0). Wait, but maybe not. Wait, in an ellipse, all points have the same sum. So, but in this case, the ellipse is tangent to x-axis, so the point (a,0) is on the ellipse. Then, the sum is L, and because tangent, there's only one intersection point. So, actually, for other points not on the ellipse, the sum would be greater or less? Wait, no. If L is the sum, then points inside the ellipse would have sum less than L, and points outside would have sum greater than L. Therefore, to have only one point on the x-axis where the sum is L, that point must be the only point where the x-axis touches the ellipse. Therefore, geometrically, the ellipse touches the x-axis at one point where the distance sum L is just enough to reach down there, but not cross.

Wait, so maybe another approach: the minimal possible value of |PF1| + |PF2| as P moves along the x-axis is the value at which the ellipse is tangent to the x-axis. So, the minimal sum of distances from a point on the x-axis to the two foci is equal to L. Thus, we can set up an optimization problem: minimize the function f(x) = sqrt{(x - 9)^2 + 20^2} + sqrt{(x - 49)^2 + 55^2}, and the minimum value will be L, the length of the major axis. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the x that minimizes f(x), then compute f(x) at that x. Therefore, compute derivative of f(x) with respect to x, set it to zero, solve for x, and compute f(x). Let's try that.

So, let's write f(x) = sqrt{(x - 9)^2 + 400} + sqrt{(x - 49)^2 + 3025}. Compute derivative f'(x):

The derivative of sqrt{(x - a)^2 + b^2} with respect to x is (x - a)/sqrt{(x - a)^2 + b^2}.

Therefore, f'(x) = [ (x - 9)/sqrt{(x - 9)^2 + 400} ] + [ (x - 49)/sqrt{(x - 49)^2 + 3025} ]

Set derivative equal to zero:

(x - 9)/sqrt{(x - 9)^2 + 400} + (x - 49)/sqrt{(x - 49)^2 + 3025} = 0

Let me denote sqrt{(x - 9)^2 + 400} as S1 and sqrt{(x - 49)^2 + 3025} as S2. So, (x - 9)/S1 + (x -49)/S2 = 0. Therefore:

(x - 9)/S1 = - (x -49)/S2

Square both sides to eliminate square roots:

[(x - 9)^2]/S1^2 = [(x -49)^2]/S2^2

But S1^2 = (x -9)^2 + 400, S2^2 = (x -49)^2 + 3025. Therefore:

[(x -9)^2]/[(x -9)^2 + 400] = [(x -49)^2]/[(x -49)^2 + 3025]

Cross-multiplying:

(x -9)^2 [ (x -49)^2 + 3025 ] = (x -49)^2 [ (x -9)^2 + 400 ]

Expand both sides:

Left side: (x -9)^2 (x -49)^2 + 3025 (x -9)^2

Right side: (x -49)^2 (x -9)^2 + 400 (x -49)^2

Subtract the common term from both sides:

3025 (x -9)^2 = 400 (x -49)^2

Divide both sides by 25:

121 (x -9)^2 = 16 (x -49)^2

Take square roots? Hmm, alternatively:

121(x^2 - 18x + 81) = 16(x^2 - 98x + 2401)

Expand left: 121x2 - 2178x + 9801

Right: 16x2 - 1568x + 38416

Bring all to left side:

121x2 -2178x +9801 -16x2 +1568x -38416 =0

Compute:

(121x2 -16x2) + (-2178x + 1568x) + (9801 -38416) = 0

105x2 -610x -28615 = 0

So the equation is 105x2 -610x -28615 = 0

Let me check algebra in expansion:

Left side after subtracting: 121x2 -16x2 = 105x2

-2178x +1568x = (-2178 +1568)= -610x

9801 -38416 = (9800 -38400) + (1 -16) = -28600 -15 = -28615, correct.

So quadratic equation: 105x2 -610x -28615 =0

Divide all terms by 5:

21x2 -122x -5723=0

Wait, 105 ÷5=21; 610/5=122; 28615 ÷5=5723.

Now, solve 21x2 -122x -5723=0

Use quadratic formula:

x = [122 ± sqrt(1222 + 4*21*5723) ] / (2*21)

Compute discriminant:

D=1222 +4*21*5723

1222= 14884

4*21=84; 84*5723

Compute 5723*84:

First 5000*84=420,000

700*84=58,800

23*84=1,932

So total: 420,000 +58,800=478,800 +1,932=480,732

Thus D = 14,884 + 480,732 = 495,616

sqrt(495616). Let me check: 7042 = 704*704. 7002=490,000, 700*4=2,800; 42=16. So (700+4)^2= 7002 + 2*700*4 +42=490,000 +5,600 +16=495,616. Yes, perfect square. sqrt(495,616)=704.

Therefore, x = [122 ±704]/42

Calculate two solutions:

x1=(122 +704)/42=826/42= Simplify. 826 ÷14=59; 42 ÷14=3. So 59/3 ≈19.666...

x2=(122-704)/42=(-582)/42= -582 ÷6= -97; ÷7= -97/7 ≈-13.857...

But since x is a coordinate on the x-axis between the projections of the foci? Wait, foci are at (9,20) and (49,55). So x ranges from 9 to 49. So x cannot be negative here. So x2 is -97/7, which is about -13.85, which is left of the origin, so probably not the point of tangency. So we take x1=59/3≈19.666...

So x=59/3. Let me check: 59 divided by 3 is 19.666..., roughly 19.666. Now we need to confirm that this is the correct x-coordinate where the ellipse is tangent to the x-axis. Then compute the sum L = sqrt{(59/3 -9)^2 +20^2} + sqrt{(59/3 -49)^2 +55^2}

First calculate 59/3 -9. 9 is 27/3, so 59/3 -27/3=32/3 ≈10.666...

Then, (32/3)^2 +202 = (1024/9) +400 = (1024 + 3600)/9=4624/9

sqrt(4624/9)=68/3 ≈22.666...

Second term: 59/3 -49=59/3 -147/3= -88/3≈-29.333...

So (-88/3)^2 +552=(7744/9)+3025= (7744 +27225)/9=34969/9

sqrt(34969/9)=sqrt(34969)/3. Let's check sqrt(34969): 187^2=34969 (since 1802=32400, 7^2=49, (180+7)^2=1802 +2*180*7 +49=32400+2520+49=34,969). Therefore sqrt(34969/9)=187/3≈62.333...

Therefore, sum L=68/3 +187/3=(68+187)/3=255/3=85. Therefore, the major axis length is 85. Wait, so L is 85?

Wait, according to our earlier reasoning, the minimal value of f(x) along the x-axis is equal to L, the major axis length. Because the ellipse is tangent to the x-axis, the sum of distances at that point is equal to L. Wait, but previously, I thought L was the length of the major axis, which is 2a. So if this sum L=85, does this mean the major axis length is 85? Wait, yes, usually in the ellipse definition, the sum of distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci is equal to 2a, which is the major axis length. Therefore, if the minimal sum is 85, does that mean the major axis is 85?

But wait, can the minimal value of the sum of distances from a point on the x-axis to the two foci be equal to the major axis length? Wait, actually, in general, for an ellipse, all points on the ellipse have the sum equal to 2a. So if the ellipse is tangent to the x-axis at some point (a,0), then that point is on the ellipse, hence the sum is 2a. So that is the length of the major axis.

But here, when we do the calculation, we minimized f(x), which is the sum of distances from (x,0) to the two foci. The minimal value of this sum is 85, which would be the major axis length. Wait, but in a way, when you have two foci, the minimal sum of distances would be the distance between the foci themselves if you could go between them, but in this case, we are constrained to the x-axis. So perhaps 85 is the minimal sum along the x-axis, and since the ellipse is tangent there, that indeed is equal to the major axis length. Therefore, the answer is 85. Therefore, I think that after this calculation, the major axis length is 85. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{85}

But let me check once again. Let's take the point (59/3, 0). Let's check the sum of distances. First, distance to (9,20):

sqrt[(59/3 -9)^2 + (0 -20)^2] = sqrt[(32/3)^2 + (-20)^2] = sqrt[(1024/9)+400] = sqrt[(1024 + 3600)/9] = sqrt[4624/9] = 68/3 ≈22.666...

Distance to (49,55):

sqrt[(59/3 -49)^2 + (0 -55)^2] = sqrt[(-88/3)^2 + (-55)^2] = sqrt[(7744/9) + 3025] = sqrt[(7744 + 27225)/9] = sqrt[34969/9] = 187/3 ≈62.333...

Sum: 68/3 +187/3 =255/3=85. Correct. So the sum of distances is indeed 85. Therefore, the major axis length is 85. Thus, the answer is \boxed{85}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{85}
