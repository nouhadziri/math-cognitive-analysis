Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let $Hom(A, B)$ denote the set of group homomorphisms from group $A$ to group $B$.
We are given that for any finite group $H$, $|Hom(G_1, H)| = |Hom(G_2, H)|$.
We need to prove that $G_1 \cong G_2$.

Let's consider some specific choices for $H$.
Case 1: Let $H = G_1$.
Then $|Hom(G_1, G_1)| = |Hom(G_2, G_1)|$.
We know that there is always the identity homomorphism $id: G_1 \to G_1$, where $id(g) = g$ for all $g \in G_1$.

Case 2: Let $H = G_2$.
Then $|Hom(G_1, G_2)| = |Hom(G_2, G_2)|$.
Similarly, there is the identity homomorphism $id: G_2 \to G_2$.

Let's consider the number of homomorphisms from a cyclic group to another group.
If $G_1 = \mathbb{Z}_n$, the number of homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_n$ to $H$ is the number of elements $h \in H$ such that $h^n = e_H$.

Let's consider the case when $H$ is a symmetric group $S_n$.

Consider the case when $H = G_1 \times G_1$.
$|Hom(G_1, G_1 \times G_1)| = |Hom(G_2, G_1 \times G_1)|$.
A homomorphism $\phi: G_1 \to G_1 \times G_1$ is determined by the images of the generators of $G_1$.

Let's use a property related to the structure of the groups.
Consider the number of homomorphisms from $G$ to $\mathbb{Z}_2$. This is related to the number of elements of order 2 in $G$.

Let $N(G)$ be the number of elements in $G$.
Let's take $H$ to be a simple group.

Consider the number of homomorphisms from $G$ to itself. This includes all automorphisms of $G$.

Let's consider the cardinality of the groups.
Let $H$ be a trivial group $\{e\}$.
$|Hom(G_1, \{e\})| = 1$ and $|Hom(G_2, \{e\})| = 1$. This doesn't give much information.

Let $H$ be a group such that $|H| = 2$, so $H \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$.
The number of homomorphisms from $G$ to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the number of normal subgroups $N$ of $G$ such that $G/N \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$. This is related to the number of elements of order 2.

Let's consider the characterization of a group by its homomorphisms to other groups.

Let's use the Yoneda Lemma in the context of categories.
Consider the functor $F_G: \text{FinGrp} \to \text{Set}$ defined by $F_G(H) = Hom(G, H)$.
We are given that $F_{G_1}(H) = F_{G_2}(H)$ for all finite groups $H$.
If this holds for all groups $H$, then by Yoneda's Lemma, $G_1 \cong G_2$.
We need to adapt this to finite groups.

Let's consider the case when $H$ is a sufficiently large symmetric group $S_n$.
Any homomorphism $\phi: G \to S_n$ corresponds to an action of $G$ on the set $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$.

Let $n = |G_1|$. Consider the regular representation of $G_1$ into $S_{|G_1|}$. This is an injective homomorphism.
Let $\rho_1: G_1 \to S_{|G_1|}$ be the regular representation of $G_1$.
Let $\rho_2: G_2 \to S_{|G_2|}$ be the regular representation of $G_2$.

Let's consider the number of homomorphisms from $G$ to $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$. These are the $n$-dimensional complex representations of $G$.

Let's go back to the initial condition.
$|Hom(G_1, H)| = |Hom(G_2, H)|$ for all finite groups $H$.

Let $|G_1| = n$ and $|G_2| = m$.
Consider $H = G_1$. $|Hom(G_1, G_1)| \ge 1$ (identity map).
Consider $H = G_2$. $|Hom(G_1, G_2)| = |Hom(G_2, G_2)| \ge 1$.

Let $H=S_3$. Then $|Hom(G_1, S_3)| = |Hom(G_2, S_3)|$.

Consider the case when $H = G_1$.
The number of homomorphisms from $G_1$ to $G_1$ is equal to the number of homomorphisms from $G_2$ to $G_1$.
The identity map is a homomorphism from $G_1$ to $G_1$.

Let's consider the mapping of elements.
For every homomorphism $\phi: G_1 \to H$, there is a corresponding homomorphism $\psi: G_2 \to H$.

Consider the character table of the groups.

Let's consider the case where $H$ is a simple group.
The number of homomorphisms from $G$ to a simple group $S$ is related to the number of normal subgroups $N$ such that $G/N$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S$.

Let $H = G_1$. The identity homomorphism $id_{G_1} \in Hom(G_1, G_1)$.
Therefore, $|Hom(G_2, G_1)| \ge 1$, so there exists at least one homomorphism from $G_2$ to $G_1$.

Let $H = G_2$. The identity homomorphism $id_{G_2} \in Hom(G_2, G_2)$.
Therefore, $|Hom(G_1, G_2)| \ge 1$, so there exists at least one homomorphism from $G_1$ to $G_2$.

Let's consider the set of subgroups of $G_1$ and $G_2$.

Let $D(G) = \{ (g_1, ..., g_n) \in G^n \mid g_1 ... g_n = e \}$.
$|Hom(\mathbb{Z}_n, G)| = |\{ g \in G \mid g^n = e \}|$.

Let $H = G_1$. Then the number of homomorphisms from $G_1$ to $G_1$ is equal to the number of homomorphisms from $G_2$ to $G_1$.
Let the homomorphisms from $G_1$ to $G_1$ be $\phi_1, \phi_2, ...$
Let the homomorphisms from $G_2$ to $G_1$ be $\psi_1, \psi_2, ...$

Consider the case where $H$ is abelian.
The number of homomorphisms from $G$ to an abelian group $A$ is equal to the number of homomorphisms from $G/[G,G]$ to $A$.
So $|Hom(G_1/[G_1,G_1], H)| = |Hom(G_2/[G_2,G_2], H)|$ for all abelian groups $H$.
This implies that $G_1/[G_1,G_1] \cong G_2/[G_2,G_2]$.

Consider the structure theorem for finite abelian groups.
The number of homomorphisms from a finite abelian group $A$ to a finite abelian group $B$ can be calculated based on their invariant factors or elementary divisors.

Let the exponent of a group $G$ be the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $g^n = e$ for all $g \in G$.
Consider $H = G_1$. The identity map $id: G_1 \to G_1$ is a homomorphism.
Consider the constant homomorphism $\phi(g) = e$ for all $g \in G_1$.

Let's consider the cardinality of the groups.
Take $H$ to be a cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$.
$|Hom(G_1, \mathbb{Z}_n)| = |Hom(G_2, \mathbb{Z}_n)|$.
The number of homomorphisms from $G$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is the number of elements $g \in G$ such that $g^k = e$ where $k$ divides $n$. This is not correct.

The number of homomorphisms from $G$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is the number of elements $g \in G$ such that $g^{|G|}$ maps to $0 \pmod n$.

Let the exponent of $G_1$ be $e_1$ and the exponent of $G_2$ be $e_2$.
Consider $H = C_k$, the cyclic group of order $k$.
$|Hom(G_1, C_k)|$ is the number of elements in $G_1$ whose order divides $k$.
$|Hom(G_2, C_k)|$ is the number of elements in $G_2$ whose order divides $k$.
So, for any $k$, the number of elements of order dividing $k$ is the same in $G_1$ and $G_2$.

Let $n_k(G)$ be the number of elements of order $k$ in $G$.
The number of elements whose order divides $k$ is $\sum_{d|k} n_d(G)$.
We have $\sum_{d|k} n_d(G_1) = \sum_{d|k} n_d(G_2)$ for all $k$.

For $k=1$, $n_1(G_1) = n_1(G_2) = 1$.
For $k=2$, $n_1(G_1) + n_2(G_1) = n_1(G_2) + n_2(G_2)$, so $n_2(G_1) = n_2(G_2)$.
For $k=3$, $n_1(G_1) + n_3(G_1) = n_1(G_2) + n_3(G_2)$, so $n_3(G_1) = n_3(G_2)$.
By induction, $n_k(G_1) = n_k(G_2)$ for all $k$.
So, the number of elements of each order is the same in $G_1$ and $G_2$.

This implies that $|G_1| = |G_2|$.

Let $|G_1| = n$. Consider $H = G_1$.
$|Hom(G_1, G_1)| = |Hom(G_2, G_1)|$.
The number of automorphisms of $G_1$ is a part of $Hom(G_1, G_1)$.

Let's use the result that two finite groups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same number of elements of each order.
We have shown that the number of elements of each order is the same in $G_1$ and $G_2$.
Therefore, $G_1 \cong G_2$.

We need to rigorously prove that $|Hom(G, C_k)|$ is the number of elements in $G$ whose order divides $k$.
A homomorphism $\phi: G \to C_k$ is determined by the image of the generators of $G$.
Let $C_k = \langle x \mid x^k = e \rangle$.
For any $g \in G$, $\phi(g)^k = \phi(g^k) = e$.
The order of $\phi(g)$ divides $k$.

Consider an element $a \in G$ such that the order of $a$ divides $k$.
Let the order of $a$ be $m$, where $m|k$.
Define a homomorphism $\phi: \langle a \rangle \to C_k$ by $\phi(a^i) = y^i$, where $y$ is an element of order $m$ in $C_k$. Such an element exists because $m|k$.
We can extend this homomorphism to $G$ if $G$ is cyclic.

Let $g \in G$ such that $ord(g) = d$, where $d|k$.
Then $\langle g \rangle$ is a subgroup of order $d$.
A homomorphism $\phi: G \to C_k$ maps $g$ to an element whose order divides $d$.
The number of elements in $C_k$ whose order divides $d$ is $\phi(d)$, Euler's totient function.

Let $g \in G$ be an element whose order divides $k$.
Consider the subgroup $\langle g \rangle$. A homomorphism from $\langle g \rangle$ to $C_k$ maps $g$ to an element whose order divides the order of $g$.
Let $ord(g) = m$, $m|k$.
A homomorphism $\phi: \langle g \rangle \to C_k$ is given by $\phi(g) = y$, where $y^m = e$.
There are $m$ such elements in $C_k$.

Let $\phi: G \to C_k$ be a homomorphism.
For any $g \in G$, $ord(\phi(g))$ divides $ord(g)$. Also, $ord(\phi(g))$ divides $k$.

Consider an element $g \in G$ such that $ord(g)$ divides $k$.
We want to construct a homomorphism $\phi: G \to C_k$ such that $\phi(g)$ has some desired property.

Let $a \in G$ have order $d$, where $d|k$.
We can define a homomorphism from $\langle a \rangle$ to $C_k$ by mapping $a$ to an element of order dividing $d$.

Let $g \in G$ such that $g^k = e$.
Define $\phi_g: \mathbb{Z} \to G$ by $\phi_g(n) = g^n$.
Consider a homomorphism $\psi: G \to C_k$.
For any $g \in G$, $\psi(g)^k = \psi(g^k) = e$. So the order of $\psi(g)$ divides $k$.

Let $g \in G$ have order $m$, $m|k$.
Consider the subgroup $\langle g \rangle$.
A homomorphism from $\langle g \rangle$ to $C_k$ maps $g$ to an element whose order divides $m$.
There are $\phi(m)$ generators of a cyclic group of order $m$.

Let $N_k(G)$ be the number of elements of order $k$ in $G$.
$|Hom(G, C_k)| = \sum_{d|k} N_d(G) \cdot \phi(d)$. This is incorrect.

Let $g \in G$ be an element such that $g^k = e$.
Consider the map $\phi: \langle g \rangle \to C_k$ by $\phi(g^i) = x^i$, where $x$ is an element of order dividing $ord(g)$.

Consider the structure of homomorphisms to cyclic groups.
A homomorphism $\phi: G \to C_k$ is determined by mapping the generators of $G$.

Let $g \in G$ such that $ord(g)$ divides $k$.
Consider the map $\psi_g: \mathbb{Z}_m \to G$, where $m=ord(g)$.
We want a homomorphism from $G$ to $\mathbb{Z}_k$.

Consider the number of subgroups of a certain order.

Let $g \in G$ be such that $g^k = e$.
Define a homomorphism $\phi: \langle g \rangle \to C_k$ by $\phi(g) = y$, where $y^m = e$, $m = ord(g)$.

Let $N(G, k)$ be the number of elements $g \in G$ such that $g^k = e$.
A homomorphism $\phi: \mathbb{Z}_k \to G$ is determined by $\phi(1)$, which is an element $g \in G$ such that $g^k = e$.
So $|Hom(\mathbb{Z}_k, G)| = |\{g \in G \mid g^k = e\}|$.

We are given $|Hom(G_1, H)| = |Hom(G_2, H)|$ for all finite groups $H$.
Let $H = C_k$.
The number of homomorphisms from $G$ to $C_k$ is the number of elements $g \in G$ such that $g^k = e$.
So, the number of elements $g \in G_1$ such that $g^k = e$ is equal to the number of elements $g \in G_2$ such that $g^k = e$.

This holds for all $k$.
This implies that the number of elements whose order divides $k$ is the same in $G_1$ and $G_2$.
Let $N_k(G)$ be the number of elements of order $k$ in $G$.
The number of elements whose order divides $k$ is $\sum_{d|k} N_d(G)$.
So $\sum_{d|k} N_d(G_1) = \sum_{d|k} N_d(G_2)$ for all $k$.

By Mobius inversion, $N_k(G_1) = N_k(G_2)$ for all $k$.
This means that the number of elements of each order is the same in $G_1$ and $G_2$.
This implies that $G_1 \cong G_2$.

This holds for all $k$.
This implies that the number of elements whose order divides $k$ is the same in $G_1$ and $G_2$.
Let $N_k(G)$ be the number of elements of order $k$ in $G$.
The number of elements whose order divides $k$ is $\sum_{d|k} N_d(G)$.
