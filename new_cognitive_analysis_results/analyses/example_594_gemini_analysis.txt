Problem:
One hundred concentric circles with radii $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100$ are drawn in a plane. The interior of the circle of radius 1 is colored red, and each region bounded by consecutive circles is colored either red or green, with no two adjacent regions the same color. The ratio of the total area of the green regions to the area of the circle of radius 100 can be expressed as $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n.$

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the ratio of the total area of the green regions to the area of the largest circle. We have 100 concentric circles with radii $r_i = i$ for $i = 1, 2, \dots, 100$. The regions formed by these circles are annuli and the interior of the smallest circle.

Let $C_i$ be the circle with radius $i$. The area of $C_i$ is $A_i = \pi r_i^2 = \pi i^2$.

The regions are:
Region 1: Interior of $C_1$, radius 1. Area = $\pi (1)^2 = \pi$. Color = red.
Region 2: Between $C_1$ and $C_2$, radii 1 and 2. Area = $\pi (2)^2 - \pi (1)^2 = 4\pi - \pi = 3\pi$.
Region 3: Between $C_2$ and $C_3$, radii 2 and 3. Area = $\pi (3)^2 - \pi (2)^2 = 9\pi - 4\pi = 5\pi$.
...
Region $k$: Between $C_{k-1}$ and $C_k$, radii $k-1$ and $k$. Area = $\pi k^2 - \pi (k-1)^2 = \pi (k^2 - (k^2 - 2k + 1)) = \pi (2k - 1)$.

The colors of the regions alternate between red and green, starting with red for Region 1.

Region 1: Red, Area = $1\pi$
Region 2: Green, Area = $3\pi$
Region 3: Red, Area = $5\pi$
Region 4: Green, Area = $7\pi$
...
Region $k$: Color depends on whether $k$ is odd or even.
If $k$ is odd, the color is red. Area = $(2k - 1)\pi$.
If $k$ is even, the color is green. Area = $(2k - 1)\pi$.

The total number of regions is 100.
Region 1: Red
Region 2: Green
Region 3: Red
Region 4: Green
...
Region 99: Red
Region 100: Green

The green regions are regions $2, 4, 6, \dots, 100$. These correspond to the annuli between $(C_1, C_2), (C_3, C_4), \dots, (C_{99}, C_{100})$.

The area of the green regions:
Region 2: Area = $(2 \cdot 2 - 1)\pi = 3\pi$
Region 4: Area = $(2 \cdot 4 - 1)\pi = 7\pi$
Region 6: Area = $(2 \cdot 6 - 1)\pi = 11\pi$
...
Region 100: Area = $(2 \cdot 100 - 1)\pi = 199\pi$

The indices of the green regions are $k = 2, 4, 6, \dots, 100$. Let $k = 2j$, where $j = 1, 2, \dots, 50$.
The area of the green region with index $2j$ is $(2(2j) - 1)\pi = (4j - 1)\pi$.

Total area of the green regions = $\sum_{j=1}^{50} (4j - 1)\pi = \pi \left( \sum_{j=1}^{50} 4j - \sum_{j=1}^{50} 1 \right)$
$= \pi \left( 4 \sum_{j=1}^{50} j - 50 \right) = \pi \left( 4 \cdot \frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - 50 \right)$
$= \pi \left( 4 \cdot 25 \cdot 51 - 50 \right) = \pi \left( 100 \cdot 51 - 50 \right) = \pi (5100 - 50) = 5050\pi$.

The area of the circle of radius 100 is $A_{100} = \pi (100)^2 = 10000\pi$.

The ratio of the total area of the green regions to the area of the circle of radius 100 is:
Ratio = $\frac{5050\pi}{10000\pi} = \frac{5050}{10000}$.

Simplify the fraction $\frac{5050}{10000}$.
Divide by 10: $\frac{505}{1000}$.
Divide by 5: $\frac{101}{200}$.

The ratio is $\frac{101}{200}$. This is in the form $m/n$, where $m = 101$ and $n = 200$.
We need to check if $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
$m = 101$, which is a prime number.
$n = 200 = 2^3 \cdot 5^2 = 8 \cdot 25 = 200$.
Since 101 is prime and does not divide 200, $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.

We are asked to find $m + n$.
$m + n = 101 + 200 = 301$.

Let's double-check the calculations.

The regions are formed by consecutive circles.
Region 1: Interior of $C_1$.
Region 2: Between $C_1$ and $C_2$.
Region 3: Between $C_2$ and $C_3$.
...
Region 100: Between $C_{99}$ and $C_{100}$.

Coloring:
Region 1 (interior of $C_1$): Red.
Region 2 (between $C_1$ and $C_2$): Green.
Region 3 (between $C_2$ and $C_3$): Red.
...

The regions with green color are the even-numbered regions: $2, 4, 6, \dots, 100$.

Area of Region $k$:
If $k=1$, Area = $\pi (1)^2 = \pi$.
If $k > 1$, Area = $\pi k^2 - \pi (k-1)^2 = (2k - 1)\pi$.

Green regions:
Region 2: Area = $(2 \cdot 2 - 1)\pi = 3\pi$.
Region 4: Area = $(2 \cdot 4 - 1)\pi = 7\pi$.
Region 6: Area = $(2 \cdot 6 - 1)\pi = 11\pi$.
...
Region 100: Area = $(2 \cdot 100 - 1)\pi = 199\pi$.

The areas of the green regions form an arithmetic progression: $3\pi, 7\pi, 11\pi, \dots, 199\pi$.
The first term is $a = 3\pi$.
The common difference is $d = 7\pi - 3\pi = 4\pi$.
The number of terms is $50$.

Sum of the areas of the green regions:
Sum = $\frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d)$, where $n = 50$.
Sum = $\frac{50}{2} (2(3\pi) + (50-1)(4\pi)) = 25 (6\pi + 49 \cdot 4\pi) = 25 (6\pi + 196\pi) = 25 (202\pi)$.
Sum = $25 \cdot 202 \pi = 5050\pi$.

This matches the previous calculation.

Area of the circle of radius 100: $\pi (100)^2 = 10000\pi$.

Ratio = $\frac{5050\pi}{10000\pi} = \frac{5050}{10000} = \frac{505}{1000} = \frac{101}{200}$.
$m = 101$, $n = 200$.
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
$m + n = 101 + 200 = 301$.

Consider a smaller example with 3 circles, radii 1, 2, 3.
Regions:
1. Interior of radius 1. Red. Area = $\pi$.
2. Between radii 1 and 2. Green. Area = $3\pi$.
3. Between radii 2 and 3. Red. Area = $5\pi$.

Total area of green regions = $3\pi$.
Area of circle of radius 3 = $9\pi$.
Ratio = $\frac{3\pi}{9\pi} = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}$.

Using the formula for the ratio:
Number of circles = 3.
Green regions are even-numbered regions: Region 2.
The index of the largest circle is 3.

Let $N$ be the number of circles.
If $N=1$, Region 1 is red. No green regions. Ratio = 0.
If $N=2$, Regions 1 (red), 2 (green). Green area = $3\pi$. Area of circle 2 = $4\pi$. Ratio = $3/4$.
If $N=3$, Regions 1 (red), 2 (green), 3 (red). Green area = $3\pi$. Area of circle 3 = $9\pi$. Ratio = $3/9 = 1/3$.
If $N=4$, Regions 1 (red), 2 (green), 3 (red), 4 (green).
Green regions: 2, 4.
Area of green region 2 = $3\pi$.
Area of green region 4 = $7\pi$.
Total green area = $3\pi + 7\pi = 10\pi$.
Area of circle 4 = $16\pi$.
Ratio = $\frac{10\pi}{16\pi} = \frac{10}{16} = \frac{5}{8}$.

Let's try to find a general formula for the ratio.
Number of circles = $N$. Radii $1, 2, \dots, N$.
Regions $1, 2, \dots, N$.
Coloring: Red, Green, Red, Green, ...
If $k$ is odd, Region $k$ is red.
If $k$ is even, Region $k$ is green.

Case 1: $N$ is even, $N = 2p$.
Green regions: $2, 4, \dots, 2p$.
Areas of green regions: $3\pi, 7\pi, \dots, (4p - 1)\pi$.
Arithmetic progression with first term $3\pi$, common difference $4\pi$, number of terms $p$.
Sum of areas = $\frac{p}{2} (2(3\pi) + (p-1)(4\pi)) = \frac{p}{2} (6\pi + 4p\pi - 4\pi) = \frac{p}{2} (2\pi + 4p\pi) = p\pi (1 + 2p)$.
Area of circle $N = 2p$: $\pi (2p)^2 = 4p^2 \pi$.
Ratio = $\frac{p\pi (1 + 2p)}{4p^2 \pi} = \frac{1 + 2p}{4p}$.

If $N=2$, $2p=2$, $p=1$. Ratio = $\frac{1 + 2(1)}{4(1)} = \frac{3}{4}$.
If $N=4$, $2p=4$, $p=2$. Ratio = $\frac{1 + 2(2)}{4(2)} = \frac{5}{8}$.

Case 2: $N$ is odd, $N = 2p + 1$.
Green regions: $2, 4, \dots, 2p$.
Areas of green regions: $3\pi, 7\pi, \dots, (4p - 1)\pi$.
Sum of areas = $p\pi (1 + 2p)$.
Area of circle $N = 2p + 1$: $\pi (2p + 1)^2$.
Ratio = $\frac{p\pi (1 + 2p)}{\pi (2p + 1)^2} = \frac{p(1 + 2p)}{(2p + 1)^2} = \frac{p}{2p + 1}$.

If $N=1$, $2p+1=1$, $p=0$. Ratio = $\frac{0}{1} = 0$.
If $N=3$, $2p+1=3$, $p=1$. Ratio = $\frac{1}{3}$.

In the given problem, $N = 100$, which is even.
$100 = 2p$, so $p = 50$.
Ratio = $\frac{1 + 2(50)}{4(50)} = \frac{1 + 100}{200} = \frac{101}{200}$.
This matches the direct calculation.

The ratio is given as $m/n = 101/200$.
$m = 101$, $n = 200$.
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
$m + n = 101 + 200 = 301$.

Final verification of the problem statement:
- One hundred concentric circles with radii $1, 2, \dots, 100$.
- Interior of circle radius 1 is red.
- Regions bounded by consecutive circles are colored red or green, no two adjacent regions the same color.

Regions are:
1. Interior of radius 1.
2. Between radii 1 and 2.
3. Between radii 2 and 3.
...
100. Between radii 99 and 100.

Coloring:
Region 1: Red
Region 2: Green
Region 3: Red
...
Region 100: Green

Total area of green regions:
Sum of areas of regions $2, 4, \dots, 100$.
Area of Region $k$ for $k > 1$ is $(2k - 1)\pi$.
Area of Region 1 is $\pi$.

Green regions are even-numbered regions.
Region 2: Area $3\pi$
Region 4: Area $7\pi$
...
Region 100: Area $199\pi$

The calculation seems consistent. The general formula derived also matches the result.
The relative primality of $m$ and $n$ needs to be confirmed.
$m = 101$, prime.
$n = 200 = 2^3 \cdot 5^2$.
Since 101 is not 2 or 5, gcd(101, 200) = 1.

The question asks for $m + n$.
$m + n = 101 + 200 = 301$.
