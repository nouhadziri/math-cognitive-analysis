Problem:
Let $S$ be a set of size 3. How many collections $T$ of subsets of $S$ have the property that for any two subsets $U \in T$ and $V \in T$, both $U \cap V$ and $U \cup V$ are in $T$ ?

Domain: Combinatorics

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Let us consider the collections $T$ grouped based on the size of the set $X=\bigcup_{U \in T} U$, which we can see also must be in $T$ as long as $T$ contains at least one set. This leads us to count the number of collections on a set of size at most 3 satisfying the desired property with the additional property that the entire set must be in the collection. Let $C_{n}$ denote that number of such collections on a set of size $n$. Our answer will then be $1+\binom{3}{0} C_{0}+\binom{3}{1} C_{1}+\binom{3}{2} C_{2}+\binom{3}{3} C_{3}$, with the additional 1 coming from the empty collection. Now for such a collection $T$ on a set of $n$ elements, consider the set $I=\bigcap_{U \in T} U$. Suppose this set has size $k$. Then removing all these elements from consideration gives us another such collection on a set of size $n-k$, but now containing the empty set. We can see that for each particular choice of $I$, this gives a bijection to the collections on the set $S$ to the collections on the set $S-I$. This leads us to consider the further restricted collections that must contain both the entire set and the empty set. It turns out that such restricted collections are a well-studied class of objects called topological spaces. Let $T_{n}$ be the number of topological spaces on $n$ elements. Our argument before shows that $C_{n}=$ $\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k} T_{k}$. It is relatively straightforward to see that $T_{0}=1, T_{1}=1$, and $T_{2}=4$. For a set of size 3 , there are the following spaces. The number of symmetric versions is shown in parentheses. - $\emptyset,\{a, b, c\}(1)$ - $\emptyset,\{a, b\},\{a, b, c\}(3)$ - $\emptyset,\{a\},\{a, b, c\}(3)$ - $\emptyset,\{a\},\{a, b\},\{a, b, c\}$ (6) - $\emptyset,\{a\},\{b, c\},\{a, b, c\}$ - $\emptyset,\{a\},\{a, b\},\{a, c\},\{a, b, c\}(3)$ - $\emptyset,\{a\},\{b\},\{a, b\} .\{a, b, c\}(3)$ - $\emptyset,\{a\},\{b\},\{a, b\},\{a, c\},\{a, b, c\}(6)$ - $\emptyset,\{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a, b\},\{a, c\},\{b, c\},\{a, b, c\}$ which gives $T_{3}=29$. Tracing back our reductions, we have that $C_{0}=\binom{0}{0} T_{0}=1, C_{1}=\binom{1}{0} T_{0}+\binom{1}{1} T_{1}=$ 2, $C_{2}=\binom{2}{0} T_{0}+\binom{2}{1} T_{1}+\binom{2}{2} T_{2}=7, C_{3}=\binom{3}{0} T_{0}+\binom{3}{1} T_{1}+\binom{3}{2} T_{2}+\binom{3}{3} T_{3}=45$, and then our answer is $1+\binom{3}{0} C_{0}+\binom{3}{1} C_{1}+\binom{3}{2} C_{2}+\binom{3}{3} C_{3}=1+1+6+21+45=74$.

<text>Let us consider the collections $T$ grouped based on the size of the set $X=\bigcup_{U \in T} U$, which we can see also must be in $T$ as long as $T$ contains at least one set. This leads us to count the number of collections on a set of size at most 3 satisfying the desired property with the additional property that the entire set must be in the collection.</text>
<explanation>The solver begins by decomposing the problem by grouping collections according to the size of the union of all subsets in T. This is a strategic decomposition that allows for a systematic approach to counting all possible collections.</explanation>

<start>212</start>
<end>408</end>
<text>Let $C_{n}$ denote that number of such collections on a set of size $n$. Our answer will then be $1+\binom{3}{0} C_{0}+\binom{3}{1} C_{1}+\binom{3}{2} C_{2}+\binom{3}{3} C_{3}$, with the additional 1 coming from the empty collection.</text>
<explanation>The solver further decomposes the problem by defining $C_n$ to count collections of a specific type, then expresses the final answer as a sum of these counts weighted by binomial coefficients. This shows how they're breaking the problem into cases based on the size of the set.</explanation>

<text>Now for such a collection $T$ on a set of $n$ elements, consider the set $I=\bigcap_{U \in T} U$. Suppose this set has size $k$. Then removing all these elements from consideration gives us another such collection on a set of size $n-k$, but now containing the empty set. We can see that for each particular choice of $I$, this gives a bijection to the collections on the set $S$ to the collections on the set $S-I$.</text>
<explanation>The solver abstracts the problem by considering the intersection of all subsets in the collection and establishing a bijection between collections on the original set and collections on a reduced set. This demonstrates the ability to identify mathematical structures and relationships that simplify the problem.</explanation>

<start>731</start>
<end>897</end>
<text>This leads us to consider the further restricted collections that must contain both the entire set and the empty set. It turns out that such restricted collections are a well-studied class of objects called topological spaces.</text>
<explanation>The solver makes a key abstraction by recognizing that the collections with specific properties correspond to topological spaces, connecting the problem to an established mathematical concept that can be leveraged to find the solution.</explanation>

<text>Let $T_{n}$ be the number of topological spaces on $n$ elements. Our argument before shows that $C_{n}=$ $\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k} T_{k}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver establishes a recursive relationship between $C_n$ and $T_k$ for various values of k, showing how the solution for larger sets can be expressed in terms of solutions for smaller sets.</explanation>

<start>1611</start>
<end>1629</end>
<text>which gives $T_{3}=29$.</text>
<explanation>After enumeration, the solver determines $T_3$, which will be used in the recursive formula to find $C_3$ and ultimately the final answer.</explanation>

<start>1629</start>
<end>1826</end>
<text>Tracing back our reductions, we have that $C_{0}=\binom{0}{0} T_{0}=1, C_{1}=\binom{1}{0} T_{0}+\binom{1}{1} T_{1}=$ 2, $C_{2}=\binom{2}{0} T_{0}+\binom{2}{1} T_{1}+\binom{2}{2} T_{2}=7, C_{3}=\binom{3}{0} T_{0}+\binom{3}{1} T_{1}+\binom{3}{2} T_{2}+\binom{3}{3} T_{3}=45$</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the recursive formula to compute $C_0$ through $C_3$, showing how each value depends on the previously calculated values of $T_k$.</explanation>

<definition>The ability to establish correspondences or bijections between different mathematical structures or sets, often to transform a problem into an equivalent one that is easier to solve.</definition>

<explanation>The solver uses binomial coefficients to account for the number of ways to choose subsets of various sizes, demonstrating combinatorial computation skills.</explanation>

<start>1826</start>
<end>1951</end>
<text>and then our answer is $1+\binom{3}{0} C_{0}+\binom{3}{1} C_{1}+\binom{3}{2} C_{2}+\binom{3}{3} C_{3}=1+1+6+21+45=74$.</text>
