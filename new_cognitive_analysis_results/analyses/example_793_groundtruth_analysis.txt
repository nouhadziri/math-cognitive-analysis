Problem:
A $7\times 1$ board is completely covered by $m\times 1$ tiles without overlap; each tile may cover any number of consecutive squares, and each tile lies completely on the board. Each tile is either red, blue, or green. Let $N$ be the number of tilings of the $7\times 1$ board in which all three colors are used at least once. For example, a $1\times 1$ red tile followed by a $2\times 1$ green tile, a $1\times 1$ green tile, a $2\times 1$ blue tile, and a $1\times 1$ green tile is a valid tiling. Note that if the $2\times 1$ blue tile is replaced by two $1\times 1$ blue tiles, this results in a different tiling. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$ .

<explanation>The solver has clearly understood the problem, which involves counting the number of ways to tile a 7×1 board with tiles of various lengths and three colors (red, blue, green), where all three colors must be used at least once. The answer "106" indicates they've successfully analyzed the problem constraints and determined the correct remainder when divided by 1000. While the thinking trajectory doesn't show the detailed steps, the correct answer demonstrates comprehension of the problem's requirements.</explanation>

<skill>Combinatorial Thinking</skill>
<definition>The ability to count arrangements, combinations or permutations of objects under given constraints. This involves breaking down counting problems into cases and applying combinatorial principles.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>106</end>
<text>106</text>
<explanation>The problem requires counting valid tilings under specific constraints. The solver has used combinatorial thinking to enumerate all possible ways to tile the 7×1 board while ensuring all three colors are used at least once. This likely involved considering different partitions of 7 and then assigning colors to tiles in each partition, while excluding cases where fewer than three colors are used.</explanation>

<skill>Case Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to break a problem into exhaustive, mutually exclusive cases and solve each case separately before combining results.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>106</end>
<text>106</text>
<explanation>To solve this problem correctly, the solver would have needed to break it down into cases, likely based on the number of tiles used and how the three colors are distributed. Though the thinking trajectory doesn't show the steps, reaching the correct answer of 106 suggests the solver effectively analyzed different cases of tile arrangements and color distributions.</explanation>

<skill>Application of Counting Principles</skill>
<definition>The ability to apply fundamental counting principles such as the sum rule, product rule, inclusion-exclusion principle, and the principle of complementary counting.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>106</end>
<text>106</text>
<explanation>The correct answer indicates the solver has applied appropriate counting principles. They likely used the inclusion-exclusion principle to count tilings with all three colors, by calculating the total number of tilings, then subtracting tilings with only one or two colors. The product rule would be used to count ways to assign colors to a particular tiling pattern.</explanation>

<skill>Modular Arithmetic</skill>
<definition>The ability to perform calculations within a system where numbers "wrap around" after reaching a certain value (the modulus), and understanding properties of remainders.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>106</end>
<text>106</text>
<explanation>The problem asks for the remainder when N is divided by 1000. The answer 106 represents this remainder, indicating the solver correctly applied modular arithmetic to find the final answer. They either kept track of the remainder throughout their calculations or computed the full value of N and then found its remainder when divided by 1000.</explanation>
