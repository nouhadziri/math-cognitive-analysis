Problem:
B.4 If $\Delta E_{r m s}=5.54 \times 10^{-17} \mathrm{~J}$, calculate the rms speed of the Be nuclei, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{Be}}$, and hence estimate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$. (Hint: $\Delta E_{r m s}$ depends on the rms value of the component of velocity along the line of sight).

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Moving ${ }^{7} \mathrm{Be}$ nuclei give rise to Doppler effect for neutrinos. Since the fractional change in energy ( $\Delta E_{\mathrm{rms}} / E_{\nu} \sim 10^{-4}$ ) is small, the Doppler shift may be considered in the nonrelativistic limit (a relativistic treatment gives almost same answer). Taking the line of sight along the $z$-direction,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\Delta E_{\mathrm{rms}}}{E_{\nu}} & =\frac{v_{z, r m s}}{c} \\
& =3.85 \times 10^{-4} \\
& =\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \frac{V_{\mathrm{Be}}}{c}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\Rightarrow V_{\mathrm{Be}}=\sqrt{3} \times 3.85 \times 10^{-4} \times 3.00 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}=2.01 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.

The average temperature is obtained by equating the average kinetic energy to the thermal energy.

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{1}{2} m_{\mathrm{Be}} V_{\mathrm{Be}}^{2}=\frac{3}{2} k_{\mathrm{B}} T_{\mathrm{c}} \\
\Rightarrow \quad T_{\mathrm{c}}=1.13 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~K}
\end{gathered}
$$
