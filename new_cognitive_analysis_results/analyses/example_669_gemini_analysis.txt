Problem:
Dave arrives at an airport which has twelve gates arranged in a straight line with exactly $100$ feet between adjacent gates. His departure gate is assigned at random. After waiting at that gate, Dave is told the departure gate has been changed to a different gate, again at random. Let the probability that Dave walks $400$ feet or less to the new gate be a fraction $\frac{m}{n}$ , where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$ .

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the probability that the distance between the initial gate and the new gate is $400$ feet or less. There are 12 gates arranged in a straight line, with 100 feet between adjacent gates.

Let the gates be numbered $1, 2, \ldots, 12$. The distance between gate $i$ and gate $j$ is $|i-j| \times 100$ feet.
The initial gate is assigned at random, so each of the 12 gates has a probability of $\frac{1}{12}$ of being the initial gate.
Let the initial gate be $I$, and the new gate be $N$. Both $I$ and $N$ are integers between 1 and 12 inclusive.
The initial gate $I$ is chosen uniformly at random from $\{1, 2, \ldots, 12\}$.
The new gate $N$ is chosen uniformly at random from $\{1, 2, \ldots, 12\}$, and $N \neq I$.

The total number of pairs of distinct gates $(I, N)$ is $12 \times 11 = 132$. Each such pair has a probability of $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{11}$ of occurring if we consider the sequential selection. Alternatively, we can consider the sample space of ordered pairs of distinct gates, which has size 132, and each pair is equally likely.

We are interested in the event that the distance between the initial gate $I$ and the new gate $N$ is $400$ feet or less.
The distance is $|I-N| \times 100$ feet.
We need $|I-N| \times 100 \leq 400$, which simplifies to $|I-N| \leq 4$.
This means $-4 \leq I-N \leq 4$, or equivalently, $-4 \leq N-I \leq 4$.

We need to find the number of pairs of distinct gates $(I, N)$ such that $|I-N| \leq 4$.
The condition $|I-N| \leq 4$ is equivalent to $N \in \{I-4, I-3, I-2, I-1, I+1, I+2, I+3, I+4\}$, and $N \neq I$.

Let's consider each possible value of the initial gate $I$:

Case 1: $I=1$
Possible values of $N$ such that $|1-N| \leq 4$ and $N \neq 1$:
$|1-N| \leq 4 \implies -4 \leq 1-N \leq 4 \implies -5 \leq -N \leq 3 \implies -3 \leq N \leq 5$.
Since $1 \leq N \leq 12$, the possible values of $N$ are $2, 3, 4, 5$.
Number of valid $N$ is 4.

Case 2: $I=2$
Possible values of $N$ such that $|2-N| \leq 4$ and $N \neq 2$:
$|2-N| \leq 4 \implies -4 \leq 2-N \leq 4 \implies -6 \leq -N \leq 2 \implies -2 \leq N \leq 6$.
Possible values of $N$ are $1, 3, 4, 5, 6$.
Number of valid $N$ is 5.

Case 3: $I=3$
Possible values of $N$ such that $|3-N| \leq 4$ and $N \neq 3$:
$|3-N| \leq 4 \implies -4 \leq 3-N \leq 4 \implies -7 \leq -N \leq 1 \implies -1 \leq N \leq 7$.
Possible values of $N$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7$.
Number of valid $N$ is 6.

Case 4: $I=4$
Possible values of $N$ such that $|4-N| \leq 4$ and $N \neq 4$:
$|4-N| \leq 4 \implies -4 \leq 4-N \leq 4 \implies -8 \leq -N \leq 0 \implies 0 \leq N \leq 8$.
Possible values of $N$ are $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8$.
Number of valid $N$ is 7.

Case 5: $I=5$
Possible values of $N$ such that $|5-N| \leq 4$ and $N \neq 5$:
$|5-N| \leq 4 \implies -4 \leq 5-N \leq 4 \implies -9 \leq -N \leq -1 \implies 1 \leq N \leq 9$.
Possible values of $N$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9$.
Number of valid $N$ is 8.

Case 6: $I=6$
Possible values of $N$ such that $|6-N| \leq 4$ and $N \neq 6$:
$|6-N| \leq 4 \implies -4 \leq 6-N \leq 4 \implies -10 \leq -N \leq -2 \implies 2 \leq N \leq 10$.
Possible values of $N$ are $2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10$.
Number of valid $N$ is 8.

Due to symmetry, the number of valid $N$ for $I=7$ will be the same as for $I=6$, which is 8.
For $I=8$, the number of valid $N$ will be the same as for $I=5$, which is 8.
For $I=9$, the number of valid $N$ will be the same as for $I=4$, which is 7.
For $I=10$, the number of valid $N$ will be the same as for $I=3$, which is 6.
For $I=11$, the number of valid $N$ will be the same as for $I=2$, which is 5.
For $I=12$, the number of valid $N$ will be the same as for $I=1$, which is 4.

Total number of pairs $(I, N)$ such that $|I-N| \leq 4$ and $I \neq N$:
Sum of the number of valid $N$ for each $I$:
$4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 2 \times (4+5+6+7) + 4 \times 8 = 2 \times 22 + 32 = 44 + 32 = 76$.

The total number of possible pairs of distinct gates $(I, N)$ is $12 \times 11 = 132$.
The probability is $\frac{76}{132}$.

We need to simplify the fraction $\frac{76}{132}$.
Both numbers are even, divide by 2: $\frac{38}{66}$.
Both numbers are even, divide by 2: $\frac{19}{33}$.

The probability is $\frac{19}{33}$.
Here, $m=19$ and $n=33$.
We need to check if $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
Prime factors of 19: 19 (prime)
Prime factors of 33: 3, 11
Since there are no common prime factors, 19 and 33 are relatively prime.

The required value is $m+n = 19 + 33 = 52$.

Alternative approach: Consider the difference $D = |I-N|$. We need $D \leq 4$.
The possible values of $D$ are $1, 2, 3, 4$.

Consider the number of pairs $(I, N)$ such that $|I-N| = k$, where $1 \leq k \leq 4$.
If $|I-N| = 1$, the pairs are $(1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), \ldots, (11,12), (12,11)$.
Pairs are $(i, i+1)$ and $(i+1, i)$.
For $i=1$ to $11$, we have 11 pairs of the form $(i, i+1)$.
For $i=1$ to $11$, we have 11 pairs of the form $(i+1, i)$.
Total number of pairs with $|I-N|=1$ is $11 + 11 = 22$.

If $|I-N| = 2$, the pairs are $(1,3), (3,1), (2,4), (4,2), \ldots, (10,12), (12,10)$.
Pairs are $(i, i+2)$ and $(i+2, i)$.
For $i=1$ to $10$, we have 10 pairs of the form $(i, i+2)$.
For $i=1$ to $10$, we have 10 pairs of the form $(i+2, i)$.
Total number of pairs with $|I-N|=2$ is $10 + 10 = 20$.

If $|I-N| = 3$, the pairs are $(i, i+3)$ and $(i+3, i)$.
For $i=1$ to $9$, we have 9 pairs of the form $(i, i+3)$.
For $i=1$ to $9$, we have 9 pairs of the form $(i+3, i)$.
Total number of pairs with $|I-N|=3$ is $9 + 9 = 18$.

If $|I-N| = 4$, the pairs are $(i, i+4)$ and $(i+4, i)$.
For $i=1$ to $8$, we have 8 pairs of the form $(i, i+4)$.
For $i=1$ to $8$, we have 8 pairs of the form $(i+4, i)$.
Total number of pairs with $|I-N|=4$ is $8 + 8 = 16$.

Total number of pairs $(I, N)$ with $I \neq N$ such that $|I-N| \leq 4$ is the sum of the number of pairs for $|I-N|=1, 2, 3, 4$.
$22 + 20 + 18 + 16 = 76$.

This matches the previous result for the number of favorable outcomes.

Double-checking the problem statement: "departure gate has been changed to a different gate". This confirms that $I \neq N$.

Alternative way to think about the probability calculation:
Let $I$ be the initial gate. $P(I=i) = \frac{1}{12}$ for $i=1, \ldots, 12$.
Given the initial gate $I=i$, the new gate $N$ is chosen uniformly at random from the remaining 11 gates.
$P(N=j | I=i) = \frac{1}{11}$ for $j \neq i$.

We want the probability $P(|I-N| \leq 4)$.
$P(|I-N| \leq 4) = \sum_{i=1}^{12} P(|I-N| \leq 4 | I=i) P(I=i)$
$P(|I-N| \leq 4) = \frac{1}{12} \sum_{i=1}^{12} P(|i-N| \leq 4 | I=i)$

Consider the term $P(|i-N| \leq 4 | I=i)$. This is the probability that the new gate $N$ satisfies $|i-N| \leq 4$, given that $N \neq i$.
The possible values of $N$ are such that $|i-N| \leq 4$, $N \neq i$, and $1 \leq N \leq 12$.

If $I=1$, we need $|1-N| \leq 4$, $N \neq 1$. Possible $N = 2, 3, 4, 5$. 4 values.
$P(|1-N| \leq 4 | I=1) = \frac{4}{11}$.

If $I=2$, we need $|2-N| \leq 4$, $N \neq 2$. Possible $N = 1, 3, 4, 5, 6$. 5 values.
$P(|2-N| \leq 4 | I=2) = \frac{5}{11}$.

If $I=3$, we need $|3-N| \leq 4$, $N \neq 3$. Possible $N = 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7$. 6 values.
$P(|3-N| \leq 4 | I=3) = \frac{6}{11}$.

If $I=4$, we need $|4-N| \leq 4$, $N \neq 4$. Possible $N = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8$. 7 values.
$P(|4-N| \leq 4 | I=4) = \frac{7}{11}$.

If $I=5$, we need $|5-N| \leq 4$, $N \neq 5$. Possible $N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9$. 8 values.
$P(|5-N| \leq 4 | I=5) = \frac{8}{11}$.

If $I=6$, we need $|6-N| \leq 4$, $N \neq 6$. Possible $N = 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10$. 8 values.
$P(|6-N| \leq 4 | I=6) = \frac{8}{11}$.

Symmetry:
$P(|12-N| \leq 4 | I=12) = \frac{4}{11}$ (same as $I=1$)
$P(|11-N| \leq 4 | I=11) = \frac{5}{11}$ (same as $I=2$)
$P(|10-N| \leq 4 | I=10) = \frac{6}{11}$ (same as $I=3$)
$P(|9-N| \leq 4 | I=9) = \frac{7}{11}$ (same as $I=4$)
$P(|8-N| \leq 4 | I=8) = \frac{8}{11}$ (same as $I=5$)
$P(|7-N| \leq 4 | I=7) = \frac{8}{11}$ (same as $I=6$)

$P(|I-N| \leq 4) = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{11} \times (4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4)$
$P(|I-N| \leq 4) = \frac{1}{132} \times 76 = \frac{76}{132} = \frac{19}{33}$.

This confirms the probability calculation.

Final check of the question: "Find $m+n$".
$m = 19$, $n = 33$.
$m+n = 19 + 33 = 52$.

Consider potential pitfalls or common mistakes:
1. Forgetting the condition that the new gate is different from the initial gate.
2. Errors in counting the number of valid new gates for each initial gate, especially at the boundaries.
3. Not simplifying the fraction to its lowest terms.
4. Misinterpreting the distance between gates.

The distance between gates $i$ and $j$ is $100 |i-j|$.
We need $100 |I-N| \leq 400$, so $|I-N| \leq 4$.

Consider a simpler case: 3 gates.
Initial gate chosen at random (1, 2, 3).
New gate chosen at random from the other two.
Pairs of distinct gates: (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2). Total 6.
Distance limit, say 100 feet. $|I-N| \leq 1$.
Favorable pairs: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2). Total 4.
Probability = $\frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$.

Using the formula approach for 3 gates, distance limit 100 feet:
$|I-N| \leq 1$.
If $I=1$, $N=2$. 1 possibility. $P(|1-N| \leq 1 | I=1) = \frac{1}{2}$.
If $I=2$, $N=1, 3$. 2 possibilities. $P(|2-N| \leq 1 | I=2) = \frac{2}{2} = 1$.
If $I=3$, $N=2$. 1 possibility. $P(|3-N| \leq 1 | I=3) = \frac{1}{2}$.

Probability = $\frac{1}{3} (\frac{1}{2} + 1 + \frac{1}{2}) = \frac{1}{3} (2) = \frac{2}{3}$. Matches.

Consider the edge cases for the number of gates (12).
When the initial gate is near the ends (1 or 12), the number of reachable gates within 400 feet is limited.

Final check of the question wording: "arranged in a straight line", "exactly 100 feet between adjacent gates", "departure gate is assigned at random", "changed to a different gate, again at random".

The problem seems straightforward once the conditions are translated into mathematical inequalities and the counting is done carefully. The symmetry helps in reducing the amount of calculation needed.

<text>The probability is $\frac{19}{33}$.
Here, $m=19$ and $n=33$.
We need to check if $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
Prime factors of 19: 19 (prime)
Prime factors of 33: 3, 11
Since there are no common prime factors, 19 and 33 are relatively prime.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies that the fraction is in lowest terms by checking that the numerator and denominator are relatively prime, examining their prime factorizations.</explanation>
