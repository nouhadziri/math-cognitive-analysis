Problem:
Compute the number of triples $(f, g, h)$ of permutations on $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ such that $$ \begin{aligned} & f(g(h(x)))=h(g(f(x)))=g(x), \\ & g(h(f(x)))=f(h(g(x)))=h(x), \text { and } \\ & h(f(g(x)))=g(f(h(x)))=f(x) \end{aligned} $$ for all $x \in\{1,2,3,4,5\}$.

Domain: Combinatorics

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Let $f g$ represent the composition of permutations $f$ and $g$, where $(f g)(x)=f(g(x))$ for all $x \in\{1,2,3,4,5\}$. Evaluating fghfh in two ways, we get $$ f=g f h=(f g h) f h=f g h f h=f(g h f) h=f h h, $$ so $h h=1$. Similarly, we get $f, g$, and $h$ are all involutions. Then $$ f g h=g \Longrightarrow f g=g h $$ so $f g=g h=h f$. Let $x:=f g=g h=h f$. Then $$ x^{3}=(f g)(g h)(h f)=1 $$ We can also show that $f g=g h=h f$ along with $f, g, h$ being involutions is enough to recover the initial conditions, so we focus on satisfying these new conditions. If $x=1$, then $f=g=h$ is an involution. There are $1+\binom{5}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\binom{5}{2,2,1}=26$ involutions, so this case gives 26 solutions. Suppose $x \neq 1$. Then since $x^{3}=1, x$ is composed of a 3 -cycle and two fixed points, of which there are 20 choices. WLOG $x=(123)$. It can be checked that $\{1,2,3\}$ must map to itself for all of $f, g, h$ and also $\{4,5\}$. We can either have all of $f, g, h$ map 4 and 5 to themselves or each other. Restricted to $\{1,2,3\}$, they are some rotation of $(12),(23),(13)$. Each of the 20 cases thus gives $2 \cdot 3=6$ triples, so overall we get $20 \cdot 6=120$. The final answer is $26+120=146$.

<start>166</start>
<end>265</end>
<text>$$ f=g f h=(f g h) f h=f g h f h=f(g h f) h=f h h, $$

<end>333</end>
<text>Similarly, we get $f, g$, and $h$ are all involutions.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that the pattern discovered for h (that h²=1) can be similarly applied to f and g, identifying that all three permutations are involutions. This pattern recognition simplifies the problem significantly.</explanation>

<start>334</start>
<end>378</end>
<text>Then $$ f g h=g \Longrightarrow f g=g h $$</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies another pattern in the relationships between the permutations, recognizing that from one of the given conditions, they can derive a simpler relationship between compositions.</explanation>

<start>379</start>
<end>410</end>
<text>so $f g=g h=h f$. Let $x:=f g=g h=h f$.</text>

<explanation>The solver identifies a special case where x=1 and analyzes it separately, counting the number of possible solutions for this specific scenario. This demonstrates the ability to isolate and completely solve a particular case.</explanation>

<start>755</start>
<end>873</end>
<text>Suppose $x \neq 1$. Then since $x^{3}=1, x$ is composed of a 3-cycle and two fixed points, of which there are 20 choices.</text>
<explanation>The solver considers the complementary case where x≠1, and uses the constraint that x³=1 to determine the structure of x in this case. This shows systematic case analysis by exhaustively covering all possibilities.</explanation>

<text>There are $1+\binom{5}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\binom{5}{2,2,1}=26$ involutions, so this case gives 26 solutions.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies combinatorial formulas to count the number of involutions on a 5-element set, using binomial coefficients to account for different cycle structures. This demonstrates sophisticated combinatorial reasoning.</explanation>

<start>755</start>
<end>873</end>
<text>Suppose $x \neq 1$. Then since $x^{3}=1, x$ is composed of a 3-cycle and two fixed points, of which there are 20 choices.</text>
<explanation>The solver counts the number of permutations with a specific cycle structure (a 3-cycle and two fixed points), showing combinatorial reasoning about permutation types.</explanation>

<start>1001</start>
<end>1127</end>
<text>Each of the 20 cases thus gives $2 \cdot 3=6$ triples, so overall we get $20 \cdot 6=120$. The final answer is $26+120=146$.</text>
