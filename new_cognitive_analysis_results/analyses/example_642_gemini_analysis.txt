Problem:
B. How many times would the resolving power of the above microscope increase or decrease if the electron beam were replaced with the proton beam? Assume that the resolving power of the microscope (i.e. the smallest distance between two point objects whose circular images can be just separated) depends only on the wave properties of the particles.

Assume that the velocities of the electrons and protons before their acceleration are zero, and that there is no interaction between own magnetic moment of either electrons or protons and the magnetic field. Assume also that the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the moving particles can be neglected.

NOTE: Very often physicists use 1 electron-volt $(1 \mathrm{eV})$, and its derivatives such as 1 $\mathrm{keV}$ or $1 \mathrm{MeV}$, as a unit of energy. 1 electron-volt is the energy gained by the electron that passed the potential difference equal to $1 \mathrm{~V}$.

Perform the calculations assuming the following data:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\text { Rest energy of electron: } & E_{e}=m_{e} c^{2}=511 \mathrm{keV} \\
\text { Rest energy of proton: } & E_{p}=m_{p} c^{2}=938 \mathrm{MeV}
\end{array}
$$

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let $R$ be the resolving power of the microscope. The problem states that the resolving power depends only on the wave properties of the particles. The resolving power is related to the wavelength of the particle, $\lambda$. Specifically, the resolving power is proportional to the wavelength: $R \propto \lambda$.

The wavelength of a particle is given by the de Broglie wavelength: $\lambda = h/p$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $p$ is the momentum of the particle.

So, the resolving power is inversely proportional to the momentum: $R \propto 1/p$.

We need to find the ratio of the resolving power when using an electron beam to the resolving power when using a proton beam. Let $R_e$ be the resolving power for electrons and $R_p$ be the resolving power for protons.

The ratio is $R_e / R_p = (1/p_e) / (1/p_p) = p_p / p_e$.

We need to find the momentum of the electron and the proton. The particles are accelerated through a potential difference of $U = 50 \mathrm{kV}$.

The kinetic energy gained by a particle with charge $q$ accelerated through a potential difference $U$ is $K = qU$.

For an electron, the charge is $q_e = -e$, and the magnitude is $|q_e| = e$.
For a proton, the charge is $q_p = +e$.

The kinetic energy of the electron is $K_e = eU$.
The kinetic energy of the proton is $K_p = eU$.

Since the kinetic energies are the same, we have $K_e = K_p$.

Now, we need to relate the kinetic energy to the momentum. We need to consider if we should use classical or relativistic formulas.

Let's calculate the kinetic energy in Joules:
$U = 50 \mathrm{kV} = 50 \times 10^3 \mathrm{V}$
$e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$
$K_e = eU = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C} \times 50 \times 10^3 \mathrm{V} = 80.1 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{J}$

Let's compare this kinetic energy with the rest energy of the electron and proton.
Rest energy of electron $E_{0e} = 511 \mathrm{keV} = 511 \times 10^3 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{J} = 818.622 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{J}$
Rest energy of proton $E_{0p} = 938 \mathrm{MeV} = 938 \times 10^6 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{J} = 1502.676 \times 10^{-13} \mathrm{J}$

The kinetic energy of the electron ($80.1 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{J}$) is a significant fraction of its rest energy ($818.622 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{J}$). So, we should use relativistic formulas for the electron.

The kinetic energy of the proton ($80.1 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{J}$) is much smaller than its rest energy ($1502.676 \times 10^{-13} \mathrm{J}$). So, we can use classical formulas for the proton.

Relativistic formula for kinetic energy: $K = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2} - mc^2$
$K + mc^2 = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}$
$(K + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$
$(pc)^2 = (K + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = K^2 + 2Kmc^2 + (mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = K^2 + 2Kmc^2$
$p^2 c^2 = K(K + 2mc^2)$
$p = \frac{\sqrt{K(K + 2mc^2)}}{c}$

For the electron:
$K_e = eU = 50 \mathrm{keV}$
$m_e c^2 = 511 \mathrm{keV}$
$p_e = \frac{\sqrt{K_e(K_e + 2m_e c^2)}}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{50 \mathrm{keV} (50 \mathrm{keV} + 2 \times 511 \mathrm{keV})}}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{50 \mathrm{keV} (50 \mathrm{keV} + 1022 \mathrm{keV})}}{c}$
$p_e = \frac{\sqrt{50 \mathrm{keV} \times 1072 \mathrm{keV}}}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{53600 (\mathrm{keV})^2}}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{53600} \mathrm{keV}}{c}$
$p_e = \frac{231.517 \mathrm{keV}}{c}$

Classical formula for kinetic energy: $K = \frac{p^2}{2m}$
$p = \sqrt{2mK}$

For the proton:
$K_p = eU = 50 \mathrm{keV}$
$m_p c^2 = 938 \mathrm{MeV} = 938 \times 10^3 \mathrm{keV}$
$m_p = \frac{938 \times 10^3 \mathrm{keV}}{c^2}$
$p_p = \sqrt{2 m_p K_p} = \sqrt{2 \frac{938 \times 10^3 \mathrm{keV}}{c^2} \times 50 \mathrm{keV}} = \sqrt{\frac{93800 \times 10^3 (\mathrm{keV})^2}{c^2}}$
$p_p = \frac{\sqrt{93800 \times 10^3} \mathrm{keV}}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{9.38 \times 10^7} \mathrm{keV}}{c} = \frac{9685.04 \mathrm{keV}}{c}$

Now, we can find the ratio of the resolving powers:
$\frac{R_e}{R_p} = \frac{p_p}{p_e} = \frac{9685.04 \mathrm{keV}/c}{231.517 \mathrm{keV}/c} = \frac{9685.04}{231.517} = 41.83$

The resolving power with the electron beam is about 41.83 times greater than with the proton beam. This means the resolving power would decrease if the electron beam were replaced with the proton beam.

The factor by which the resolving power would decrease is $R_p / R_e = 1 / 41.83 = 0.0239$.

Let's double check the calculations.

Alternative approach: Use the de Broglie wavelength.
$\lambda = h/p$
$\frac{R_e}{R_p} = \frac{\lambda_e}{\lambda_p} = \frac{h/p_e}{h/p_p} = \frac{p_p}{p_e}$

Let's verify the relativistic calculation for the electron momentum.
$K_e = 50 \mathrm{keV}$
$E_{0e} = 511 \mathrm{keV}$
$E_e = K_e + E_{0e} = 50 + 511 = 561 \mathrm{keV}$
$E_e^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$
$(p_e c)^2 = E_e^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 = (561 \mathrm{keV})^2 - (511 \mathrm{keV})^2$
$(p_e c)^2 = 314721 (\mathrm{keV})^2 - 261121 (\mathrm{keV})^2 = 53600 (\mathrm{keV})^2$
$p_e c = \sqrt{53600} \mathrm{keV} = 231.517 \mathrm{keV}$
$p_e = \frac{231.517 \mathrm{keV}}{c}$  (Matches the previous calculation)

Let's verify the classical calculation for the proton momentum.
$K_p = 50 \mathrm{keV}$
$m_p c^2 = 938 \mathrm{MeV} = 938 \times 10^3 \mathrm{keV}$
$m_p = \frac{938 \times 10^3 \mathrm{keV}}{c^2}$
$K_p = \frac{p_p^2}{2m_p}$
$p_p^2 = 2 m_p K_p = 2 \frac{938 \times 10^3 \mathrm{keV}}{c^2} \times 50 \mathrm{keV} = \frac{93800 \times 10^3 (\mathrm{keV})^2}{c^2}$
$p_p = \frac{\sqrt{93800 \times 10^3} \mathrm{keV}}{c} = \frac{9685.04 \mathrm{keV}}{c}$ (Matches the previous calculation)

The ratio of resolving powers is $R_e / R_p = p_p / p_e = 41.83$.
This means the resolving power with electrons is about 42 times larger than with protons.

If the electron beam is replaced with the proton beam, the resolving power will decrease.
The factor of decrease is $R_p / R_e = 1 / 41.83 = 0.0239$.

The resolving power would decrease by a factor of approximately 41.83.

Let's think about the phrasing of the question: "How many times would the resolving power ... increase or decrease".

If the resolving power decreases, the answer should reflect a decrease.

Consider the ratio of the resolving power with the proton beam to the resolving power with the electron beam:
$\frac{R_p}{R_e} = \frac{p_e}{p_p} = \frac{231.517}{9685.04} = 0.0239$

The resolving power with the proton beam is about 0.0239 times the resolving power with the electron beam.
This means the resolving power would decrease by a factor of $\frac{1}{0.0239} = 41.83$.

Alternatively, we can directly say that the resolving power would decrease by a factor of 41.83.

The question asks "how many times".

If the resolving power with electrons is $R_e$ and with protons is $R_p$, and $R_e = 41.83 R_p$, then if we switch from electrons to protons, the new resolving power $R_p$ is $1/41.83$ times the old resolving power $R_e$.

Let's verify the units throughout the calculation.
Kinetic energy in Joules: $K = 80.1 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{J}$.
Rest energy of electron: $E_{0e} = 818.622 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{J}$.
Rest energy of proton: $E_{0p} = 1502.676 \times 10^{-13} \mathrm{J}$.

Electron momentum calculation (using Joules and kg):
$m_e c^2 = 818.622 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{J}$
$m_e = \frac{818.622 \times 10^{-16}}{(3 \times 10^8)^2} = 9.0958 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{kg}$
$K_e = 80.1 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{J}$
$p_e = \frac{\sqrt{K_e(K_e + 2m_e c^2)}}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{80.1 \times 10^{-16} (80.1 \times 10^{-16} + 2 \times 818.622 \times 10^{-16})}}{3 \times 10^8}$
$p_e = \frac{\sqrt{80.1 \times 10^{-16} (80.1 \times 10^{-16} + 1637.244 \times 10^{-16})}}{3 \times 10^8}$
$p_e = \frac{\sqrt{80.1 \times 10^{-16} \times 1717.344 \times 10^{-16}}}{3 \times 10^8} = \frac{\sqrt{137559.2544 \times 10^{-32}}}{3 \times 10^8}$
$p_e = \frac{3.7089 \times 10^{-14}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.2363 \times 10^{-22} \mathrm{kg m/s}$

Electron momentum calculation (using keV and c):
$p_e = \frac{231.517 \mathrm{keV}}{c} = \frac{231.517 \times 10^3 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = \frac{3.7089 \times 10^{-14}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.2363 \times 10^{-22} \mathrm{kg m/s}$ (Matches)

Proton momentum calculation (using Joules and kg):
$m_p c^2 = 1502.676 \times 10^{-13} \mathrm{J}$
$m_p = \frac{1502.676 \times 10^{-13}}{(3 \times 10^8)^2} = 1.6696 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{kg}$
$K_p = 80.1 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{J}$
$p_p = \sqrt{2 m_p K_p} = \sqrt{2 \times 1.6696 \times 10^{-27} \times 80.1 \times 10^{-16}}$
$p_p = \sqrt{267.482 \times 10^{-43}} = \sqrt{26.7482 \times 10^{-42}} = 5.1718 \times 10^{-21} \mathrm{kg m/s}$

Proton momentum calculation (using keV and c):
$p_p = \frac{9685.04 \mathrm{keV}}{c} = \frac{9685.04 \times 10^3 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = \frac{1.5515 \times 10^{-12}}{3 \times 10^8} = 5.1717 \times 10^{-21} \mathrm{kg m/s}$ (Matches)

Ratio of resolving powers:
$\frac{R_e}{R_p} = \frac{p_p}{p_e} = \frac{5.1718 \times 10^{-21}}{1.2363 \times 10^{-22}} = 41.83$

The resolving power with electrons is 41.83 times greater than with protons.
If we replace the electron beam with the proton beam, the resolving power will decrease by a factor of 41.83.

The question asks how many times the resolving power would increase or decrease. Since the resolving power decreases, we should state the factor of decrease.

Final check of the question wording and requirements. The question explicitly asks for the factor of increase or decrease.

Resolving power is inversely proportional to the momentum. Since the proton has a much larger momentum than the electron for the same kinetic energy (due to its larger mass), the resolving power will be smaller for protons.

The resolving power would decrease by a factor of approximately 41.8.
