Problem:
Dave arrives at an airport which has twelve gates arranged in a straight line with exactly $100$ feet between adjacent gates. His departure gate is assigned at random. After waiting at that gate, Dave is told the departure gate has been changed to a different gate, again at random. Let the probability that Dave walks $400$ feet or less to the new gate be a fraction $\frac{m}{n}$ , where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$ .

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so Dave is at an airport with twelve gates arranged in a straight line, and there's 100 feet between each adjacent gate. First, he gets assigned a random departure gate. Then, later, they change his gate to a different one, also at random. We need to find the probability that he has to walk 400 feet or less to the new gate. The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, let me break this down step by step. Let's see... There are twelve gates. Each gate is 100 feet apart. So the distance between gate 1 and gate 2 is 100 feet, gate 1 to gate 3 is 200 feet, and so on up to gate 1 to gate 12, which would be 1100 feet. But we care about when the distance is 400 feet or less. Since each gate is 100 feet apart, that translates to 4 gates apart or less. So, if Dave is at gate i, the new gate has to be within i ± 4 to be 400 feet or less away.

But since the gates are arranged in a straight line, gates at the ends have fewer adjacent gates. For example, if he's at gate 1, gates 2 to 5 are within 400 feet, but there are no gates before 1. Similarly, if he's at gate 12, gates 8 to 11 are within 400 feet behind him. So the number of gates within 400 feet depends on his current gate.

So the first thing is to model this as a probability problem where we have a departure gate assigned uniformly at random, then a new gate assigned uniformly at random from the remaining 11 gates. We need to compute the probability that the distance between the original and new gate is at most 400 feet.

Because the assignment is random, each initial gate has equal probability (1/12), and then given the initial gate, each of the other 11 gates is equally likely (1/11 chance). So the total probability is the average over all initial gates of the probability that a random different gate is within 4 gates away.

Therefore, the approach would be:

1. For each initial gate (1 through 12), determine how many gates are within 4 gates away (including both sides, but gates cannot be less than 1 or more than 12).
2. For each such initial gate, the count of valid gates would be from (current gate - 4) to (current gate + 4), excluding the current gate itself.
3. Then sum all these counts and divide by the total number of possible changes (which is 12*11, since for each initial gate, there are 11 possible new gates).
4. Simplify the fraction to get m/n and compute m + n.

Alternatively, since each initial gate is equally likely and each reassignment is equally likely, the average number of favorable cases over total cases would give the required probability.

Another way to think about it is symmetry. Since all gates are equivalent except for their position relative to the ends, maybe the number of gates within 400 feet varies depending on whether the initial gate is near the middle or near the ends.

So, let's categorize the gates based on their position. Gates 1 to 4 and 9 to 12 (if I'm counting right) will have fewer gates on one side, while gates 5 to 8 will have 4 gates on both sides. Wait, actually, for gate 1, gates within 4 gates are gates 2-5. For gate 2, gates 1,3-6. Gate 3: 1,2,4-7. Gate 4:1-3,5-8. Then gates 5-8: they can reach from (current -4) to (current +4), which for gate 5: 1-9 (but wait, 1 to 9 is 9 gates, but wait, wait. 5 -4 =1 and 5 +4 =9. So from 1 to 9, exluding 5. Wait, but 1 to 9 is gates 1-9, and 5 is somewhere in the middle. But that includes gates 1-4 on the left and 6-9 on the right. Similarly, gate 6: 2-10, gates 2-5 and 7-10. No, wait, actually, each mid gate (so gates 5-8) can reach 4 gates on each side.

Wait, hang on, no. Let me double-check.

Take gate 5: it's position 5. The distance to gate 1 would be 4 gates apart (positions 1-5 are 4 intervals, each 100 feet, so 400 feet). Similarly, gate 5 can go from gate 1 to gate 9? Wait, that seems too far. Wait, no. Let's think in terms of distance.

Wait, actual distance is number of gates between. Wait, adjacent gates are 100 feet apart. So, from gate i to gate j, the distance is |i - j| * 100 feet. So, distance of 400 feet or less would correspond to |i - j| ≤ 4.

Therefore, if the current gate is i, the new gate j must satisfy |i - j| ≤ 4. Since gates are from 1 to 12, and the new gate has to be different, then the number of favorable gates is the number of gates within |i -j | ≤4, excluding i itself. So for gates not near the end, there are 8 possible gates (4 on each side). But for gates near the ends, they would have fewer gates on one side.

For example, for gate 1: j can be 2,3,4,5 (since 1-1 is 0, which is excluded, then 1-2 is 1, up to 1-5, which is 4). So that's four gates. Similarly for gate 2: j could be 1,3,4,5,6. That's five gates. Wait, wait:

Wait, let's re-examine.

If we are at gate i, the number of gates j such that |i - j| ≤4 and j ≠i. For i=1: j can be 2,3,4,5 (since |1 -j| ≤4 implies j=1±k, but j has to be at least 1. So solutions: j=1,2,3,4,5. Exclude j=1, so 4 gates.

Similarly for gate 2: |2-j| ≤4 → j= -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6. But valid gates are 1 to 12, so j=1,2,3,4,5,6. Excluding 2, which leaves 1,3,4,5,6. So 5 gates.

Gate 3: |3 -j| ≤4 → j from -1 to 7. Actual gates 1-7, excluding 3. So that's gates 1,2,4,5,6,7. So 6 gates.

Gate 4: |4 -j| ≤4 → j from 0 to 8. Actual gates 1-8, excluding 4. So gates 1,2,3,5,6,7,8. So 7 gates.

Gate 5: |5 -j| ≤4 → j from 1 to 9, excluding 5. So gates 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. So 8 gates.

Similarly, gates 6 through 9 will mirror gates 5 through 8. Wait, let me check.

Wait, actually gates 5-8 will all have 8 gates within 4 gates. Then gates above 8 start to decrease. Gate 9: |9-j| ≤4 → j from 5 to 13. But gates go up to 12. So j=5-12, excluding 9: gates 5,6,7,8,10,11,12. That's 7 gates.

Gate 10: |10 - j| ≤4 → j from 6 to 14. So j=6-10, excluding 10, gives 6 gates. Wait, gates from 6-10, subtract 10, is gates 6,7,8,9.

Wait, no, hang on: |10 - j| ≤4 → j ≥ 10 -4 =6 and j ≤10 +4=14. Since gates go up to 12, so j=6-12. Exclude 10. So gates 6,7,8,9,11,12. That's 6 gates.

Gate 11: |11 - j| ≤4 → j=7-15. So j=7-12, exclude 11. So gates=7,8,9,10,12. That's 5 gates.

Gate 12: |12 -j| ≤4 →j=8-16. Gates 8-12. Excluding 12. Gates 8,9,10,11. So 4 gates.

Wait, so let me summarize the number of favorable gates for each initial gate:

Gate 1: 4
Gate 2: 5
Gate 3: 6
Gate 4:7
Gates 5-8:8 each
Gate 9:7
Gate 10:6
Gate 11:5
Gate 12:4

So let's verify gates 5 and 9:

For gate 5: |5 - j| ≤4 → j=1 to 9, excluding 5. So 8 gates:1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. Correct. 8.

Gate 9: |9 -j| ≤4 → j=5 to13, which becomes 5 to12. Exclude 9. So j=5,6,7,8,10,11,12. 7 gates. Correct.

Similarly, gate 8: |8 -j| <=4 → j=4-12. Exclude 8. So 4-7 and 9-12. That's 4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12. 8 gates. Wait, that seems different. Wait, gate numbers from 4 to 12 minus 8. It is 8 gates:

From 4 up to 8 - here, j=4,5,6,7,8. Wait, no, 8-j <=4? Let me recompute. The absolute value |8 -j| <=4, so j can be 8-4=4 up to 8+4=12. But exclude j=8. So the gates are 4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12. 8 gates. Yes.

Similarly for gate 7: |7 -j| <=4 → 3-11, excluding 7. So gates 3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11. 8 gates. Correct.

So gates 5-8 each have 8 gates. Gates before 5 have decreasing numbers, gates after 8 also have decreasing numbers.

So let me list all gates and their counts:

Gate 1: 4
Gate 2:5
Gate 3:6
Gate 4:7
Gate 5:8
Gate 6:8
Gate 7:8
Gate 8:8
Gate 9:7
Gate 10:6
Gate 11:5
Gate 12:4

Alright, total number of favorable cases when summing all gates. Each of these counts is per initial gate.

Since each initial gate is equally likely (probability 1/12), and the number of possible new gates is 11 (since different). So for each initial gate, the probability of reassigning to a gate within 400 feet is (number of favorable gates)/11. Therefore, the total probability is the average of all these (sum of (number of favorable gates)/11 ) divided by 12.

Wait, alternatively, since each initial gate has a count, total favorable pairs are sum_{i=1 to 12} (number of new gates for i). Since each initial gate is 12 possibilities, each with their own number of new gates, total favorable is (4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +8 +8 +8 +7 +6 +5 +4). Then the total possible pairs are 12 * 11, since for each initial gate, 11 new gates. So the probability is (sum of favorable) / (12*11).

Yes, that makes sense.

Therefore, first calculate the sum.

Let's compute:

Gates 1 and 12: 4 each → 8

Gates 2 and 11:5 each →10

Gates 3 and 10:6 each →12

Gates 4 and 9:7 each →14

Gates 5,6,7,8:8 each →8*4 =32

So total favorable gates:8 +10 +12 +14 +32 =8+10=18; 18 +12=30; 30 +14=44; 44 +32=76.

Wait, total sum is 76.

So total favorable pairs:76.

Total possible pairs:12*11 =132.

Therefore, probability is 76/132.

Simplify that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 4:76 ÷4=19; 132 ÷4=33.

So 19/33.

19 and 33. 19 is prime, 33 is 3*11. No common factors. So simplified fraction is 19/33.

Thus m=19, n=33. m+n=52.

Wait a second. Let me check my arithmetic again.

Sum of favorable gates:

Gates 1:4

2:5

3:6

4:7

5-8:8 each (8*4=32)

9:7

10:6

11:5

12:4

So add numbers in order:4+5=9, +6=15, +7=22, +32=54, +7=61, +6=67, +5=72, +4=76. Yes, 76. Correct.

Total possible pairs:12*11=132. 76/132 reduces to 19/33. Correct, because 76 ÷4 =19, 132 ÷4=33. So 19/33 is coprime, so m=19, n=33, m +n=52.

Wait, but let me just make sure that this answer makes sense.

Another way to check is to visualize the problem. For each initial gate, we count how many gates are within 4 gates away (excluding itself). Because the gates are arranged in a line, after the first few gates, the number of adjacent gates increase until you reach the middle gates where it's maximum.

So for initial gates 1-4, the number of favorable gates increase from 4 to 7.

Similarly from 9-12, the same counts in reverse.

For gates 5-8, which are the central gates, they have 8 gates each.

So when we averaged it out, it's like adding 4,5,6,7,8,8,8,8,7,6,5,4. The sum is 76. Then divided by 12*11. So 76/132=19/33≈0.575. That seems reasonable.

Alternatively, if we try for one gate, say gate 1. Probability is 4/11. For gate 2,5/11, etc. Then average all those. So (4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +8 +8 +8 +7 +6 +5 +4)/12 then /11? Wait: No, maybe the total is (4+5+6+7+8+8+8+8+7+6+5+4)=76. So total probability is76 / (12*11). So yes, same as before.

Alternatively, more precisely, probability per gate:

Each initial gate occurs with probability 1/12. Then, per initial gate, probability to select one of the favorable gates is (count)/11. So the total probability is:

(1/12) * [ (4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +8 +8 +8 +7 +6 +5 +4)/11 ]

Which is equal to (76)/(12*11) =76/132=19/33. Correct.

Therefore, the answer is 19/33, m +n =52. So, boxed answer should be \boxed{52}.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{52}

<text>Alright, let me break this down step by step. Let's see... There are twelve gates. Each gate is 100 feet apart. So the distance between gate 1 and gate 2 is 100 feet, gate 1 to gate 3 is 200 feet, and so on up to gate 1 to gate 12, which would be 1100 feet. But we care about when the distance is 400 feet or less. Since each gate is 100 feet apart, that translates to 4 gates apart or less.</text>

<text>Wait, actual distance is number of gates between. Wait, adjacent gates are 100 feet apart. So, from gate i to gate j, the distance is |i - j| * 100 feet. So, distance of 400 feet or less would correspond to |i - j| ≤ 4.</text>

<text>Therefore, if the current gate is i, the new gate j must satisfy |i - j| ≤ 4. Since gates are from 1 to 12, and the new gate has to be different, then the number of favorable gates is the number of gates within |i -j | ≤4, excluding i itself. So for gates not near the end, there are 8 possible gates (4 on each side). But for gates near the ends, they would have fewer gates on one side.

For example, for gate 1: j can be 2,3,4,5 (since 1-1 is 0, which is excluded, then 1-2 is 1, up to 1-5, which is 4). So that's four gates. Similarly for gate 2: j could be 1,3,4,5,6. That's five gates. Wait, wait:

Wait, let's re-examine.

If we are at gate i, the number of gates j such that |i - j| ≤4 and j ≠i. For i=1: j can be 2,3,4,5 (since |1 -j| ≤4 implies j=1±k, but j has to be at least 1. So solutions: j=1,2,3,4,5. Exclude j=1, so 4 gates.</text>
<explanation>The solver begins a systematic analysis of cases, starting with gates at the end of the line (gate 1) and working through different initial positions. They carefully count the number of gates within the distance constraint for each starting position, showing methodical enumeration of possibilities.</explanation>

<start>3444</start>
<end>4306</end>
<text>Similarly for gate 2: |2-j| ≤4 → j= -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6. But valid gates are 1 to 12, so j=1,2,3,4,5,6. Excluding 2, which leaves 1,3,4,5,6. So 5 gates.

Gate 3: |3 -j| ≤4 → j from -1 to 7. Actual gates 1-7, excluding 3. So that's gates 1,2,4,5,6,7. So 6 gates.

Gate 4: |4 -j| ≤4 → j from 0 to 8. Actual gates 1-8, excluding 4. So gates 1,2,3,5,6,7,8. So 7 gates.

Gate 5: |5 -j| ≤4 → j from 1 to 9, excluding 5. So gates 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. So 8 gates.

Similarly, gates 6 through 9 will mirror gates 5 through 8. Wait, let me check.</text>
<explanation>The solver continues their systematic analysis, methodically working through each possible starting gate and calculating the number of gates within the distance constraint. They are thorough in their approach, checking each case individually while also looking for patterns.</explanation>

<start>4307</start>
<end>5054</end>
<text>Wait, actually gates 5-8 will all have 8 gates within 4 gates. Then gates above 8 start to decrease. Gate 9: |9-j| ≤4 → j from 5 to 13. But gates go up to 12. So j=5-12, excluding 9: gates 5,6,7,8,10,11,12. That's 7 gates.

Gate 10: |10 - j| ≤4 → j from 6 to 14. So j=6-10, excluding 10, gives 6 gates. Wait, gates from 6-10, subtract 10, is gates 6,7,8,9.

Wait, no, hang on: |10 - j| ≤4 → j ≥ 10 -4 =6 and j ≤10 +4=14. Since gates go up to 12, so j=6-12. Exclude 10. So gates 6,7,8,9,11,12. That's 6 gates.

Gate 11: |11 - j| ≤4 → j=7-15. So j=7-12, exclude 11. So gates=7,8,9,10,12. That's 5 gates.

Gate 12: |12 -j| ≤4 →j=8-16. Gates 8-12. Excluding 12. Gates 8,9,10,11. So 4 gates.</text>
<explanation>The solver completes their systematic case analysis by examining the remaining gates (9-12). They carefully account for the constraint that gates only go up to 12, demonstrating thoroughness in their analysis by considering boundary conditions.</explanation>

Gate 2: 5
Gate 3: 6
Gate 4:7
Gates 5-8:8 each
Gate 9:7
Gate 10:6
Gate 11:5
Gate 12:4

So let's verify gates 5 and 9:

For gate 5: |5 - j| ≤4 → j=1 to 9, excluding 5. So 8 gates:1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. Correct. 8.

Gate 9: |9 -j| ≤4 → j=5 to13, which becomes 5 to12. Exclude 9. So j=5,6,7,8,10,11,12. 7 gates. Correct.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes a pattern in the results - the number of favorable gates increases from 4 to 8 as you move from gate 1 to gates 5-8, then decreases symmetrically back to 4 for gate 12. This pattern recognition helps organize the analysis and provides a check on the calculations.</explanation>

<start>6319</start>
<end>6668</end>
<text>So gates 5-8 each have 8 gates. Gates before 5 have decreasing numbers, gates after 8 also have decreasing numbers.

<start>6669</start>
<end>7283</end>
<text>Alright, total number of favorable cases when summing all gates. Each of these counts is per initial gate.

Since each initial gate is equally likely (probability 1/12), and the number of possible new gates is 11 (since different). So for each initial gate, the probability of reassigning to a gate within 400 feet is (number of favorable gates)/11. Therefore, the total probability is the average of all these (sum of (number of favorable gates)/11 ) divided by 12.

Wait, alternatively, since each initial gate has a count, total favorable pairs are sum_{i=1 to 12} (number of new gates for i). Since each initial gate is 12 possibilities, each with their own number of new gates, total favorable is (4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +8 +8 +8 +7 +6 +5 +4). Then the total possible pairs are 12 * 11, since for each initial gate, 11 new gates. So the probability is (sum of favorable) / (12*11).</text>
<explanation>The solver formulates the probability calculation mathematically, expressing it first as an average of conditional probabilities and then as a ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes. This demonstrates the ability to translate the problem into precise mathematical expressions.</explanation>

<start>8761</start>
<end>9121</end>
<text>Alternatively, more precisely, probability per gate:

Each initial gate occurs with probability 1/12. Then, per initial gate, probability to select one of the favorable gates is (count)/11. So the total probability is:

(1/12) * [ (4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +8 +8 +8 +7 +6 +5 +4)/11 ]

Which is equal to (76)/(12*11) =76/132=19/33. Correct.</text>
<explanation>The solver provides a more precise mathematical formulation of the probability calculation, using the law of total probability to express it as a weighted average.

<end>7879</end>
<text>Wait, total sum is 76.

So total favorable pairs:76.

Total possible pairs:12*11 =132.

Therefore, probability is 76/132.

Simplify that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 4:76 ÷4=19; 132 ÷4=33.

So 19/33.

19 and 33. 19 is prime, 33 is 3*11. No common factors. So simplified fraction is 19/33.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies their calculation of the total favorable cases, simplifies the fraction, and checks that the result is in lowest terms by examining the factors of the numerator and denominator. This demonstrates careful verification of results.</explanation>

<start>7880</start>

<text>Thus m=19, n=33. m+n=52.

Wait a second. Let me check my arithmetic again.

2:5

3:6

4:7

5-8:8 each (8*4=32)

9:7

10:6

11:5

12:4

So add numbers in order:4+5=9, +6=15, +7=22, +32=54, +7=61, +6=67, +5=72, +4=76. Yes, 76. Correct.</text>
<explanation>The solver double-checks their arithmetic for calculating the total number of favorable gates, showing diligence in verifying calculations. They perform the addition step-by-step to ensure accuracy.</explanation>

<start>8171</start>
<end>8760</end>
<text>Total possible pairs:12*11=132. 76/132 reduces to 19/33. Correct, because 76 ÷4 =19, 132 ÷4=33. So 19/33 is coprime, so m=19, n=33, m +n=52.

Wait, but let me just make sure that this answer makes sense.

Another way to check is to visualize the problem. For each initial gate, we count how many gates are within 4 gates away (excluding itself). Because the gates are arranged in a line, after the first few gates, the number of adjacent gates increase until you reach the middle gates where it's maximum.

So for initial gates 1-4, the number of favorable gates increase from 4 to 7.

Similarly from 9-12, the same counts in reverse.

For gates 5-8, which are the central gates, they have 8 gates each.

So when we averaged it out, it's like adding 4,5,6,7,8,8,8,8,7,6,5,4. The sum is 76. Then divided by 12*11. So 76/132=19/33≈0.575. That seems reasonable.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses multiple approaches to verify their answer. They check that the fraction is in lowest terms, and they also perform a reasonableness check by visualizing the problem and confirming that the pattern of counts makes sense given the physical arrangement of gates. This demonstrates thorough verification through different perspectives.</explanation>

SUMMARY_START
The most important cognitive skills demonstrated in this problem-solving trajectory are:

1. Problem Representation - The solver effectively translates the word problem into a mathematical framework, identifying the key variables and constraints.

2. Systematic Case Analysis - The solver methodically works through each possible starting gate position, carefully counting the number of gates within the distance constraint.

3. Pattern Recognition - The solver identifies symmetry in the problem structure, recognizing that the counts of favorable gates follow a pattern that increases toward the middle gates and then decreases.

4. Mathematical Formulation - The solver exp
