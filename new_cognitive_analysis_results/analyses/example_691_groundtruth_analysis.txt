Problem:
Suppose that  $X$  is a compact metric space and  $T: X\rightarrow X$  is a continous function. Prove that  $T$  has a returning point. It means there is a strictly increasing sequence  $n_i$  such that  $\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} T^{n_k}(x_0)=x_0$  for some  $x_0$ .

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Consider the space of real regular Borel measures on \(X\)**:
   - Let \(M(X)\) be the space of real regular Borel measures on \(X\). This space can be viewed as the dual space of \(C(X)\), the space of continuous real-valued functions on \(X\), with the weak-* topology.

2. **Define the action of \(T\) on measures**:
   - Define the action of \(T\) on a measure \(\mu \in M(X)\) by \(T\mu(A) = \mu(T^{-1}(A))\) for all Borel subsets \(A\) of \(X\). This defines a continuous map on the space of probability measures on \(X\).

3. **Use fixed point theory**:
   - The set of probability measures on \(X\) is a convex compact set in the weak-* topology. By the Banach-Alaoglu theorem, this set is compact. By the Schauder fixed-point theorem, there exists a probability measure \(\mu\) on \(X\) such that \(T\mu = \mu\). This means \(T\) is measure-preserving with respect to \(\mu\).

4. **Apply the Recurrence Theorem**:
   - By the Recurrence Theorem, for every Borel subset \(A\) of \(X\), the set \(S_A\) of those \(x \in A\) for which only finitely many of the points \(T^n(x)\), \(n \geq 1\), belong to \(A\) has measure zero.

5. **Construct a countable basis of open sets**:
   - Let \((U_n)_{n}\) be a countable basis of open sets for \(X\). Define \(S = \bigcup S_{U_n}\). Since \(S\) is a countable union of sets of measure zero, \(S\) itself has measure zero.

6. **Identify returning points**:
   - Every point \(x \in X \setminus S\) has the property that whenever \(x \in U\) (where \(U\) is an open subset of \(X\)), infinitely many of the points \(T^n(x)\) belong to \(U\). This implies that for such \(x\), there exists a strictly increasing sequence \(n_i\) such that \(\lim_{k \to \infty} T^{n_k}(x) = x\).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, any point \(x \in X \setminus S\) is a returning point, proving the existence of a returning point in \(X\).
