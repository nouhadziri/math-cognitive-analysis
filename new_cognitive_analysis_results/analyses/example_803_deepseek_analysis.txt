Problem:
In general, whenever an electric and a magnetic field are at an angle to each other, energy is transferred; for example, this principle is the reason electromagnetic radiation transfers energy. The power transferred per unit area is given by the Poynting vector:

$$
\vec{S}=\frac{1}{\mu_{0}} \vec{E} \times \vec{B}
$$

In each part of this problem, the last subpart asks you to verify that the rate of energy transfer agrees with the formula for the Poynting vector. Therefore, you should not use the formula for the Poynting vector before the last subpart!

A long, insulating cylindrical rod has radius $R$ and carries a uniform volume charge density $\rho$. A uniform external electric field $E$ exists in the direction of its axis. The rod moves in the direction of its axis at speed $v$.

Compute the Poynting vector, draw its direction on a diagram, and verify that it agrees with the rate of energy transfer.

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to compute the Poynting vector for this cylindrical rod that's charged and moving in an external electric field. Then check if the energy transfer rate from the Poynting vector matches the actual energy being transferred. But before the last part, I shouldn't use the Poynting vector formula directly, right? Wait, but the problem says in each part the last subpart is to verify using the Poynting vector, so maybe the main problem here has several subparts, but as presented, this is the main question. Hmm.

Let me parse the question again. It says, in this problem, the last subpart asks to verify that the rate of energy transfer agrees with the Poynting vector. Therefore, before that, we shouldn't use the Poynting vector. But here, the problem directly asks me to compute the Poynting vector, draw its direction, and verify it agrees with the rate of energy transfer. So maybe this is the last subpart? Possibly. So perhaps earlier parts would have asked about currents, fields, etc., but since they aren't here, I need to figure it out from scratch.

Okay. Let's start with the setup. There's a long insulating cylindrical rod with radius R, carrying uniform volume charge density ρ. It's in an external electric field E in the direction of its axis, which is the same direction it's moving at speed v. So, the rod is moving along its own axis, which is also the direction of the external E-field.

First, since the rod is moving, the charges in the rod are moving, so there is a current. The rod is insulating, so the charges can't flow through the material, but since it's moving as a whole, the charge density is moving, so that would create a current. The current density J should be ρ times the velocity v, right? Because current density is charge density times velocity. So J = ρv in the direction of motion, which is along the axis.

Now, there's an external electric field E along the axis. But also, since the rod is moving, the charges in the rod are moving, so in the lab frame, there might be magnetic effects. Wait, but ρ is volume charge density, and since it's moving, in the frame of the lab, we have a current which would generate a magnetic field. But since the rod is insulating, the charges aren't free to move, but the entire rod is moving, so the charges are moving with the rod. Therefore, the current is indeed J = ρv.

But since the rod is neutral? Wait, no. The problem states it has a uniform volume charge density ρ, so it's charged. Therefore, the rod has a net charge per unit volume ρ. Therefore, when it's moving at speed v, the current is J = ρv. But since it's a cylinder of radius R, the total current would be I = J * area = ρv * πR2. But maybe I need to find the magnetic field due to this current.

However, there's also the external electric field E. The Poynting vector is (1/μ0)(E × B). So, I need to find both E and B in the region where we are calculating S. The problem says "verify that the rate of energy transfer agrees with the formula for the Poynting vector." So probably, we need to compute the power either via mechanical work done on the rod or via the electromagnetic energy flux given by the Poynting vector.

Wait, the rod is moving in the direction of the external electric field. So, the external E-field is along the axis, same as the direction of motion. Hmm. Let's think. The external electric field would exert a force on the charges in the rod. The charges are ρ per unit volume, so the force per unit volume is ρE. Since the rod is moving at speed v, the power delivered per unit volume would be force times velocity, which is ρE*v. So the total power would be ρE*v multiplied by the volume. But what is the volume here? Per unit length, the volume would be πR2, so maybe the power per unit length is ρEvπR2. Is this correct?

But the problem says to verify the rate of energy transfer via the Poynting vector. So, if we compute the Poynting vector, integrate it over the surface of the rod, that should give the total power flowing into the rod. Wait, or maybe out of the rod? Let me be careful.

The Poynting vector represents the power per unit area flowing through a surface. So, if we consider the rod, the power transfer would be the flux of the Poynting vector over the surface of the rod. So to compute that, we need the E and B fields on the surface of the rod, then integrate S · dA over the cylinder.

So let me start by computing the electric and magnetic fields.

First, the external electric field E is given along the axis. In addition, the rod itself is charged with charge density ρ, so it produces its own electric field. Wait, that's a point I might have missed. The rod is a charged insulator with charge density ρ, so in the lab frame, it's a charged cylinder. By Gauss's law, the electric field inside the cylinder (r < R) due to the charge density ρ would be radial. Let me compute that.

Using Gauss's law for a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius r < R, length L:

The charge enclosed is ρ * πr2L.

The electric flux is E_rod * 2πrL.

Therefore, E_rod * 2πrL = ρ πr2L / ε0

So E_rod = (ρ r) / (2 ε0) in the radial direction. So inside the rod, the electric field due to the charge is radial and proportional to r. Outside the rod (r > R), the electric field would be as if all the charge is concentrated along the axis, i.e., E_rod = (ρ πR2 L) / (2π ε0 r L) ) = (ρ R2) / (2 ε0 r). But since the rod is moving, perhaps there's a magnetic field due to the current.

Wait, the rod's charge is moving with velocity v, which would create a current. The current density J = ρ v, as said earlier, directed along the axis. So the total current I is J * πR2 = ρ v π R2. So this current would produce a magnetic field. Using Ampère's law, for a circular loop of radius r around the cylinder.

For r > R: Ampère's law gives B * 2πr = μ0 I = μ0 ρ v π R2, so B = (μ0 ρ v R2) / (2 r). The direction is circumferential, i.e., circulating around the cylinder, direction given by the right-hand rule. Since the current is along the axis (direction of velocity v), the B field is tangential, circling the cylinder.

For r < R: The enclosed current is J * πr2 = ρ v π r2. Then Ampère's law gives B * 2πr = μ0 ρ v π r2, so B = (μ0 ρ v r) / 2. So inside the rod, the magnetic field increases linearly with r.

But in the problem, there's an external electric field E along the axis. So the total electric field at any point is the superposition of the external E and the internal E due to the rod's charge. However, the internal E is radial, while the external E is axial. So the total electric field is a combination of radial and axial components.

But when we compute the Poynting vector S = (1/μ0) E × B, we need the total E and total B. However, the external E is given. Wait, but maybe the external E is due to some external sources, so perhaps that E is present irrespective of the rod's own fields. So in the problem, we might have to consider both the external E and the fields generated by the rod's charge and current.

But let me recheck. The rod is placed in an external electric field E. So this external E is in addition to the electric field created by the rod's own charge. So the total electric field is the vector sum of the external E and the rod's own E. Similarly, the total magnetic field is due to the rod's current (since it's moving) and any external magnetic fields. But the problem mentions only an external electric field. So no external magnetic field. Therefore, B is entirely due to the rod's current.

Thus, at a point inside the rod (r < R), the electric field is the external E (axial) plus the rod's own radial E. The magnetic field B is circumferential due to the rod's current. So both E and B have components: E has axial and radial, and B is circumferential.

So the total E is the vector sum. Let me write down components:

Inside the rod (r < R):

Electric field:
- Axial component: E_external (let's denote as E)
- Radial component: E_rod = (ρ r) / (2 ε0) ẑ, wait no. Wait, wait, the rod's own electric field is radial. Wait, E_rod is radial, so in cylindrical coordinates, if the cylinder's axis is along the z-axis, then E_rod is in the radial direction (r-direction). The external E is along the z-axis. So total E has components in r and z.

Magnetic field:
Due to the current J = ρ v ẑ, which creates a circumferential B (φ-direction). For r < R, B = (μ0 ρ v r)/2 φ-direction.

So the total E and B vectors are:

E_total = E_external ẑ + E_rod r̂ = E ẑ + (ρ r)/(2 ε0) r̂

B_total = (μ0 ρ v r)/2 φ̂

Thus, when taking the cross product E × B, let's compute that:

First, E × B would be (E ẑ + (ρ r)/(2 ε0) r̂) × ( (μ0 ρ v r)/2 φ̂ )

We can expand this cross product:

First term: E ẑ × (μ0 ρ v r / 2 ) φ̂

Second term: (ρ r / 2 ε0 ) r̂ × (μ0 ρ v r / 2 ) φ̂

Compute each term.

First term: ẑ × φ̂ = -r̂ (using cylindrical coordinates cross product: ẑ × φ̂ = -r̂)

So first term is E * (μ0 ρ v r / 2 ) * (-r̂ )

Second term: r̂ × φ̂ = ẑ (since r̂ × φ̂ = ẑ )

Thus, the second term is (ρ r / 2 ε0 ) * (μ0 ρ v r / 2 ) * ẑ

Simplify the terms:

First term: - (E μ0 ρ v r ) / 2 * r̂

Second term: (μ0 ρ2 v r2 ) / (4 ε0 ) * ẑ

Therefore, the cross product E × B is:

S = (1/μ0) [ - (E μ0 ρ v r ) / 2 * r̂ + (μ0 ρ2 v r2 ) / (4 ε0 ) * ẑ ]

Simplify by factoring out μ0:

First term: - (E ρ v r)/2 * r̂

Second term: (ρ2 v r2 ) / (4 ε0 ) * ẑ

Thus, S = - (E ρ v r)/2 r̂ + (ρ2 v r2 )/(4 ε0 ) ẑ

Hmm. So the Poynting vector has a radial component and an axial component. But what is the physical significance?

Wait, to verify the rate of energy transfer, we'll probably need to compute the flux of the Poynting vector through the surface of the rod, i.e., over the cylindrical surface at r = R.

But let's first see what the direction of the Poynting vector is. The radial component is negative, meaning it's pointing inward (since r̂ is outward radial). The axial component is in the positive ẑ direction.

But before jumping into that, perhaps I should check if there's a simpler way. Alternatively, consider the power transfer via mechanical work. The external electric field does work on the charges in the rod as it moves.

The power delivered is force times velocity. The force on the rod due to the external E field is F = ρ * E * volume. Wait, force per unit volume is ρ E. Therefore, total force is ρ E V, where V is the volume. Then the power is F * v = ρ E V v.

But actually, per unit volume, it's ρ E v, and power per unit length would be ρ E v π R2, since volume per unit length is π R2. Therefore, total power (per unit length) P = ρ E v π R2.

Alternatively, the rate of work done on the charges by the electric field. Since the charges are moving with velocity v, the electric field does work at a rate of E * J, integrated over the volume. Wait, power per unit volume is E · J. Thus, total power is ∫ E · J dV. Since E is external and along ẑ, and J = ρ v ẑ, E · J = E ρ v. Therefore, total power is E ρ v times the volume, which matches above.

Therefore, P = E ρ v π R2 L (for a length L), so power per unit length is E ρ v π R2.

Now, we have to check if the Poynting vector calculation gives the same result. So integrate S · dA over the surface of the rod. So, consider the surface of the cylinder (r = R). The Poynting vector there (r = R) is S = - (E ρ v R)/2 r̂ + (ρ2 v R2 )/(4 ε0 ) ẑ

Thus, when taking the dot product with dA (which is outward normal, so radial), the axial component of S doesn't contribute. Only the radial component contributes. So the power flux is:

∫ S · dA = ∫ [ - (E ρ v R)/2 r̂ ] · (r̂ dA ) = - (E ρ v R)/2 ∫ dA over the cylindrical surface.

But wait, the surface area per unit length is 2π R * 1 (for unit length), so ∫ dA per unit length is 2π R. Therefore, ∫ S · dA per unit length is - (E ρ v R)/2 * 2π R = - E ρ v π R2.

But the sign is negative, meaning that the power is flowing into the cylinder (since S · dA is negative, the Poynting vector is directed inward). Therefore, the rate of energy transfer into the rod is P = E ρ v π R2 per unit length, which matches the mechanical power calculation above.

Therefore, the Poynting vector correctly accounts for the power being transferred into the rod by the external electric field performing work on the charges. So the direction of the Poynting vector is inward radially, which makes sense since energy is flowing into the rod.

Wait, but also there was an axial component in S, but at the surface of the rod (r=R), the axial component is (ρ2 v R2 )/(4 ε0 ) ẑ. However, when calculating the flux through the cylindrical surface, the axial component is parallel to the axis, and the area element of the cylindrical surface is radial. Therefore, the axial component of S does not contribute to the flux through the cylindrical surface. However, if we considered the ends of the cylinder, the axial component would contribute, but since the rod is long, and we are considering per unit length, the contribution from the ends is negligible. Also, the problem doesn't mention considering the ends.

Therefore, the entire flux is due to the radial component of S. Which is negative, indicating power flowing into the rod, matching the mechanical power.

Therefore, the Poynting vector's radial inward component correctly provides the rate of energy transfer, and the axial component might be related to some other energy flow, but since we don't have ends, it's not considered.

In terms of drawing the direction of the Poynting vector, at the surface of the rod (r=R), it has an inward radial component and an axial component. But since the flux is primarily due to the radial component, which is inward, so vectors pointing into the cylinder, spiraling inwards and upwards? Hmm, but maybe the direction is radially inward and in the axial direction. But the key is for the flux, but drawing on a diagram.

Alternatively, in cross-section, if you look at the cylinder, the E external is along the axis. The E_total would have a radial component due to the rod's charge, but perhaps the external E is given as the total E in the axial direction? Wait, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, actually, the problem says "the rod moves in the direction of its axis at speed v" and "the external electric field E exists in the direction of its axis". So possibly, the total E field isn't necessarily just the external one. However, if the rod is in an external field E, then perhaps in addition to its own field. Or maybe in the problem, the E mentioned is the total field. Wait, no, the wording is: "A uniform external electric field E exists in the direction of its axis."

So the total electric field is external E plus field due to the rod's charge. But when calculating the work done on the charges by the field, the charges are subject to the total electric field. Wait, but maybe the motion is due to some external force, maintaining velocity v despite the external E field. Hmm, but it says the rod is moving at speed v, so perhaps it's moving with constant velocity, so net force is zero.

But the problem is phrased as: "the rod moves in the direction of its axis at speed v". There may be forces acting on it to keep it moving at constant velocity, considering there is charge and external E field. If the external electric field is E, then the electric force on the rod would be, per unit volume, ρ E, so total force would be ρ E π R2 L. If it's moving at constant speed, there must be another force countering it, perhaps mechanical. But that's perhaps beyond the problem.

But in terms of energy transfer, the external electric field does work on the moving charges. So the power is indeed E ρ v π R2 per unit length. Therefore, the flux of the Poynting vector gives the same result.

But in our calculation, the flux of S is equal to - E ρ v π R2, which has the same magnitude but negative, indicating power flowing in.

Therefore, the answer is verified. So yeah, the Poynting vector is correctly giving the rate of energy transfer into the rod as calculated by mechanical work. Therefore, the verification is done.

Alternatively, let me check if other contributions might exist. For example, the internal electric field due to the rod's charge could do work as well. But since the rod is moving at constant velocity, perhaps we can consider the fields in a steady state. The charges in the rod are moving perpendicular to their own electric field (since the rod's E is radial, and velocity is axial), so there's no work done by the internal electric field. Only the external electric field is in the direction of motion, doing work.

Alternatively, considering Ohm's law for power dissipation, but since the rod is insulating, there is no current due to the electric field (except convection current due to the motion). Hmmm.

But given that the two methods (mechanical power and Poynting vector flux) agree, we can conclude that the Poynting vector correctly accounts for the energy transfer. Therefore, the direction of the Poynting vector is radially inward at the surface of the rod (due to the radial component of S), and its magnitude is such that the integral gives the correct power.

To summarize the steps:

1. The current density in the rod is J = ρ v ẑ.

2. The magnetic field inside the rod (r < R) is B = (μ0 ρ v r)/2 φ̂.

3. The total electric field is the external axial E plus the internal radial E_rod = (ρ r)/(2 ε0) r̂.

4. The Poynting vector S = (1/μ0) (E_total × B) evaluated at r = R.

5. The cross product E × B gives a radial and axial component, but only the radial contributes to the surface integral over the cylinder.

6. Integrating the radial component over the surface gives power inflow matching the mechanical work done by the external E field.

Therefore, the Poynting vector has radially inward direction (negative r̂ direction) at the surface, leading to energy inflow. The rate of energy transfer computed via the Poynting vector agrees with the mechanical power calculation.

**Final Answer**
The Poynting vector is radial inward with magnitude \(\frac{E \rho v R}{2}\) at the surface, and the rate of energy transfer is verified as \(\boxed{\pi R^2 \rho E v}\) per unit length.

So E_rod = (ρ r) / (2 ε0) in the radial direction. So inside the rod, the electric field due to the charge is radial and proportional to r.

<text>Now, we have to check if the Poynting vector calculation gives the same result. So integrate S · dA over the surface of the rod. So, consider the surface of the cylinder (r = R). The Poynting vector there (r = R) is S = - (E ρ v R)/2 r̂ + (ρ2 v R2 )/(4 ε0 ) ẑ

Thus, when taking the dot product with dA (which is outward normal, so radial), the axial component of S doesn't contribute. Only the radial component contributes. So the power flux is:

∫ S · dA = ∫ [ - (E ρ v R)/2 r̂ ] · (r̂ dA ) = - (E ρ v R)/2 ∫ dA over the cylindrical surface.

But wait, the surface area per unit length is 2π R * 1 (for unit length), so ∫ dA per unit length is 2π R. Therefore, ∫ S · dA per unit length is - (E ρ v R)/2 * 2π R = - E ρ v π R2.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies their result by calculating the energy flux through the surface of the rod using the Poynting vector. They correctly compute the surface integral and find that the magnitude matches their earlier mechanical work calculation. This demonstrates the ability to cross-check results using different approaches.</explanation>

<text>But the sign is negative, meaning that the power is flowing into the cylinder (since S · dA is negative, the Poynting vector is directed inward). Therefore, the rate of energy transfer into the rod is P = E ρ v π R2 per unit length, which matches the mechanical power calculation above.

Therefore, the Poynting vector correctly accounts for the power being transferred into the rod by the external electric field performing work on the charges. So the direction of the Poynting vector is inward radially, which makes sense since energy is flowing into the rod.</text>
<explanation>The solver interprets the negative sign in their calculation, recognizing that it indicates energy flowing into the rod. They confirm that this matches their mechanical power calculation, demonstrating their ability to verify results and ensure consistency between different approaches.</explanation>

<text>Now, there's an external electric field E along the axis. But also, since the rod is moving, the charges in the rod are moving, so in the lab frame, there might be magnetic effects. Wait, but ρ is volume charge density, and since it's moving, in the frame of the lab, we have a current which would generate a magnetic field. But since the rod is insulating, the charges aren't free to move, but the entire rod is moving, so the charges are moving with the rod. Therefore, the current is indeed J = ρv.</text>
<explanation>The solver catches themselves and reconsiders whether there would be a current in an insulating rod. They recognize their initial confusion, think through the physics more carefully, and correctly conclude that while the rod is insulating, the movement of the entire rod creates a current density. This shows metacognitive monitoring and self-correction.</explanation>

<text>But since the rod is neutral? Wait, no. The problem states it has a uniform volume charge density ρ, so it's charged. Therefore, the rod has a net charge per unit volume ρ. Therefore, when it's moving at speed v, the current is J = ρv. But since it's a cylinder of radius R, the total current would be I = J * area = ρv * πR2. But maybe I need to find the magnetic field due to this current.</text>
<explanation>The solver questions whether the rod is neutral, then corrects this misconception by referring back to the problem statement. This demonstrates metacognitive awareness of potential misunderstandings and the ability to check and correct them.</explanation>
