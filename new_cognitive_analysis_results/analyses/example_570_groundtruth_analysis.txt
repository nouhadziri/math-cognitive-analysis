Problem:
1.  At a certain moment, the time experienced by the particle is $\tau$. What reading $t_{0}$ on a stationary clock located at $x=0$ will be observed by the particle? After a long period of time, does the observed reading $t_{0}$ approach a certain value? If so, what is the value?

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
When the clock in the origin time is equal to $t_{0}$, it emits a signal that contain the information of its time. This signal will arrive at the particle at time $t$, while the particle position is at $x(t)$. We have

$$
c\left(t-t_{0}\right) =x(t)
\tag{20}
$$
$$
t-t_{0}=\frac{c}{g}\left(\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{g t}{c}\right)^{2}}-1\right)
$$
$$
t =\frac{t_{0}}{2} \frac{2-\frac{g t_{0}}{c}}{1-\frac{g t_{0}}{c}} .
\tag{21}
$$

When the information arrive at the particle, the particle's clock has a reading according to eq.(19). So we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{c}{g} \sinh \frac{g \tau}{c} & =\frac{t_{0}}{2} \frac{2-\frac{g t_{0}}{c}}{1-\frac{g t_{0}}{c}} \\
0 & =\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{g t_{0}}{c}\right)^{2}-\frac{g t_{0}}{c}\left(1+\sinh \frac{g \tau}{c}\right)+\sinh \frac{g \tau}{c} .
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\frac{g t_{0}}{c} =1+\sinh \frac{g \tau}{c} \pm \cosh \frac{g \tau}{c}
\tag{22}
$$

Using initial condition $t=0$ when $\tau=0$, we choose the negative sign

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{g t_{0}}{c} & =1+\sinh \frac{g \tau}{c}-\cosh \frac{g \tau}{c} \\
t_{0} & =\frac{c}{g}\left(1-e^{-\frac{g \tau}{c}}\right) .
\end{aligned}
\tag{23}
$$

As $\tau \rightarrow \infty, t_{0}=\frac{c}{g}$. So the clock reading will freeze at this value.
