Problem:
The decomposition reaction $2 \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}(g) \stackrel{\Delta}{\rightarrow} 2 \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}(g)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g)$ is started in a closed cylinder under isothermal isochoric condition at an initial pressure of $1 \mathrm{~atm}$. After $\mathrm{Y} \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~s}$, the pressure inside the cylinder is found to be $1.45 \mathrm{~atm}$. If the rate constant of the reaction is $5 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, assuming ideal gas behavior, what is the value of $\mathrm{Y}$?

<explanation>While the solution is extremely concise, it represents the final answer after analyzing the decomposition reaction 2N₂O₅(g) → 2N₂O₄(g) + O₂(g). The solver needed to understand the stoichiometry of this reaction to determine how the change in moles affects the pressure in the system.</explanation>

<explanation>The final answer of 2.3 indicates the solver used the given rate constant (5 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹) to determine the time (Y × 10³ s) required for the reaction to reach the specified pressure. This requires understanding how reaction kinetics relates to the extent of reaction over time.</explanation>

<start>0</start>
<end>2</end>
<text>2.3</text>
<explanation>The problem specifies "assuming ideal gas behavior," and the solver needed to connect the change in pressure from 1 atm to 1.45 atm to the change in number of moles of gas. Under isothermal isochoric conditions, the pressure ratio directly corresponds to the mole ratio.</explanation>

<skill>First-Order Reaction Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to apply the mathematical models specific to first-order reactions, including the integrated rate law and how concentration changes exponentially with time.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>2</end>
<text>2.3</text>
<explanation>The rate constant provided (5 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹) suggests this is a first-order reaction. The solver would have needed to apply the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction to determine how the concentration of N₂O₅ changes over time, which affects the pressure in the system.</explanation>

<start>0</start>
<end>2</end>
<text>2.3</text>
<explanation>The problem specifies "isothermal isochoric condition," meaning the solver needed to understand that in this scenario, pressure changes are directly proportional to changes in the total number of moles of gas, as temperature and volume are held constant.</explanation>
