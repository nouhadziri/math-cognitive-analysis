Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I've got this group theory problem here. Let's tackle part (a) first.

Problem a) says: Prove that \( H^x = H^y \) if and only if \( x^{-1}y \in H \). 

Alright, so \( H^x \) is the conjugate of subgroup H by element x, right? That is, \( H^x = \{ xhx^{-1} \mid h \in H \} \). Similarly for \( H^y \).

First, I need to show that if \( x^{-1}y \in H \), then \( H^x = H^y \). Then the converse, if \( H^x = H^y \), then \( x^{-1}y \in H \).

Let's start with the forward direction. Suppose \( x^{-1}y \in H \). Let’s denote \( h_0 = x^{-1}y \), so \( y = x h_0 \).

Then, \( H^y = (xh_0) H (xh_0)^{-1} = x h_0 H h_0^{-1} x^{-1} \).

But since H is a subgroup and \( h_0 \in H \), the conjugate \( h_0 H h_0^{-1} \) is just H because subgroups are closed under conjugation by their own elements. Therefore, \( H^y = x H x^{-1} = H^x \). So that shows that if \( x^{-1}y \in H \), then \( H^x = H^y \).

Now for the converse. Suppose \( H^x = H^y \). That means \( x H x^{-1} = y H y^{-1} \). Let’s rearrange this equality.

Starting with \( x H x^{-1} = y H y^{-1} \), if I multiply both sides on the left by \( y^{-1} \) and on the right by \( y \), I get:

\( y^{-1} x H x^{-1} y = H \).

Let’s denote \( z = y^{-1}x \), so then we have \( z H z^{-1} = H \), that is, z is in the normalizer of H in G. Wait, but we need more, right? Because the normalizer is the set of elements where conjugation leaves H invariant. But if H is not necessarily normal, the normalizer is just the set of elements z where \( z H z^{-1} = H \).

But in our case, since \( H^x = H^y \), we have that \( z H z^{-1} = H \), so z is in the normalizer N_G(H). But H could have a normalizer larger than H itself. Wait, but the problem states that H is a proper subgroup, so maybe there's some property I haven't considered yet?

Wait, hold on. The problem also gives another condition: for all \( x \in G - H \), \( H^x \cap H = \{e\} \). Maybe we need to use this condition.

Wait, but I need to check part (a). But part (a) doesn't mention the condition about the intersection, except maybe indirectly?

Wait, no—the initial problem setup says that H is a proper subgroup with H^x ∩ H = {e} for all x in G - H. So when solving part (a), we can use that condition? Hmm. Maybe not necessarily. Wait, let me check.

Problem a) is stated as a general problem under the given conditions. That is, the entire problem a) and b) operate under the premise that G is a group with m elements, H is a proper subgroup with n elements, and that for all x in G - H, \( H^x \cap H = \{e\} \). So in part (a), even though the intersection condition is given globally for the entire problem, perhaps part (a) can be proven without using the intersection condition. Because conjugation properties are more general. Wait, but actually the statement of part (a) is under the problem's initial conditions, which include the intersection condition. Hmm. Maybe part (a) requires the intersection condition. Wait.

Wait, maybe part (a) is true in general for any subgroup H with the given conjugation properties. Wait, let's see. If H is a subgroup such that H^x ∩ H = {e} for x not in H, then in part (a) perhaps there's something additional. But no, the first thought is that the conjugation of H by x and y gives the same conjugate subgroup iff x^{-1}y normalizes H. However, here since H^x ∩ H = {e} for x not in H, maybe the normalizer of H is H itself. Let me check.

Suppose x is not in H. Then, if x were in N_G(H), then H^x = H. But H^x ∩ H = {e}. But since H is a subgroup, if H^x = H, then H^x ∩ H = H. Therefore, unless H is trivial, this can't happen. Therefore, N_G(H) = H, because if any element x outside H normalizes H, then H^x would equal H, which would contradict the condition H^x ∩ H = {e} (unless H is trivial). So since H is a proper subgroup, and the intersection condition holds, the normalizer must be H itself. Therefore, in that case, if \( z H z^{-1} = H \), then z must be in H. So then, in the converse direction, where we had \( z H z^{-1} = H \), then z ∈ N_G(H) = H.

Therefore, in the converse: If H^x = H^y, then z ∈ N_G(H) = H, i.e., x^{-1}y = z ∈ H. Therefore, x^{-1}y ∈ H.

Thus, in the problem's setup, with H^x ∩ H = {e} for x ∉ H, that actually the normalizer of H is H itself, which allows us to conclude that if \( H^x = H^y \), then x^{-1}y must be in H, since z = x^{-1}y normalizes H and therefore must be in H.

So, perhaps that's the line of reasoning. Therefore, part (a) is proven both directions. Let me write it again step by step.

Forward direction: If x^{-1}y ∈ H, then H^y = H^{xh} = H^x, since conjugating by an element of H doesn't change the conjugation (since H is a subgroup).

Conversely, if H^x = H^y, then as above, z = y^{-1}x is in N_G(H). Since H^x = H^y implies zHz^{-1} = H, so z normalizes H. However, if z were not in H, then since N_G(H) is a subgroup containing H, but given the problem's condition that for any x not in H, H^x ∩ H = {e}, this would lead to a contradiction. Because if z ∉ H, then since z normalizes H, H^z = H. Therefore, H ∩ H^z = H ∩ H = H. But H must contain at least e and more elements since it's a subgroup. However, by problem condition, for any x ∉ H, H^x ∩ H = {e}. But here z is not in H, yet H^z ∩ H = H, which is impossible unless H is trivial. But since H is a proper subgroup, it's not the entire group, but it's allowed to have size more than 1. So this leads to a contradiction, hence z must be in H. Therefore, N_G(H) = H. Hence, if H^x = H^y, then z = y^{-1}x ∈ H, which implies x^{-1}y ∈ H.

So the key was that H^x ∩ H = {e} for x ∉ H forces the normalizer of H to be H itself. Hence, part (a) relies on that given condition. Cool, that makes sense.

Moving on to part (b): Find the number of elements of the set \( \bigcup_{x \in G} H^x \) as a function of m and n.

So we need to compute the size of the union of all conjugates of H in G. Let me denote this union as \( \mathcal{U} = \bigcup_{x \in G} H^x \).

We need to find |U|.

First, since H is a subgroup, its conjugates H^x are also subgroups, each of order n because conjugation is an automorphism. However, from part (a), different conjugates H^x and H^y are equal if x^{-1}y ∈ H, otherwise they are distinct.

Wait, but actually part (a) says H^x = H^y iff x^{-1}y ∈ H, which is equivalent to saying that y ∈ Hx. Therefore, the number of distinct conjugates of H is equal to the number of cosets of H in G. Wait, but in general, the number of conjugates of a subgroup H is equal to [G : N_G(H)]. In our case, as established before, N_G(H) = H, so the number of conjugates is [G : H] = m/n. Since |G| = m, |H| = n.

Hence, there are m/n distinct conjugates of H in G. Now, the union U is the union of all these m/n subgroups, each of size n. However, they can overlap. The problem gives that for any x not in H, H^x ∩ H = {e}. Wait, but perhaps more generally, for two different conjugates H^x and H^y, their intersection is {e}? Let me check.

Suppose H^x and H^y are two different conjugates. If x and y are in different cosets of H, which they are, then suppose H^x ≠ H^y. If z ∈ H^x ∩ H^y, then z = x h x^{-1} = y k y^{-1} for some h, k ∈ H. So this implies that:

x h x^{-1} = y k y^{-1}

Rearranging, (y^{-1}x) h (x^{-1}y) = k.

Let’s denote w = y^{-1}x. Then, w h w^{-1} = k. Hence, w h w^{-1} ∈ H. Since h ∈ H and k ∈ H.

Therefore, w h w^{-1} ∈ H. So this says that w conjugates h into H. However, w is y^{-1}x. If w is not in H, then since H^w ∩ H = {e}, hence any element in H^w ∩ H must be e. Therefore, if w ∉ H, then only the identity element is in both H^w and H. Wait, but h is in H, and w h w^{-1} is in H.

But here, the conjugation by w (where w ∉ H, since x and y are in different cosets) of an element h in H leads to an element k in H. But since H^w ∩ H = {e}, hence k must be e, and so w h w^{-1} = e => h = e. Therefore, z = x h x^{-1} = x e x^{-1} = e.

Hence, if H^x and H^y are distinct conjugates, then their intersection is {e}.

Is that correct?

Let me verify. Suppose H^x and H^y are two distinct conjugates, so xH ≠ yH (since H^x = H^y iff x^{-1}y ∈ H). Then, for any element z in H^x ∩ H^y, we have z must be e.

Yes, because if we take z = x h x^{-1} = y k y^{-1}, then as shown earlier, y^{-1}x h x^{-1}y = k. Let me check again.

Let z = x h x^{-1} = y k y^{-1}. Then, h = x^{-1} y k y^{-1} x. Let w = y^{-1} x. Then, h = w^{-1} k w. So, h is a conjugate of k by w^{-1}, meaning h is in H^{w^{-1}}.

But if w = y^{-1}x is not in H (since x and y are in different cosets), then H^{w^{-1}} and H intersect only at e. But h and k are in H, so h is in H^{w^{-1}} ∩ H = {e}, hence h = e and thus z = x h x^{-1} = e. Similarly, k must be e.

Therefore, only the identity is in the intersection of two distinct conjugates of H. Therefore, all the conjugates H^x intersect each other only at e.

Therefore, the union U is the union of [G : H] = m/n subgroups, each of size n, and pairwise intersecting only at e. Therefore, the total number of elements in U is:

Number of conjugates * (size of each conjugate - 1) + 1

Because all conjugates share the identity element, so we have to subtract 1 for each conjugate after the first one.

So, the formula would be:

|U| = (m/n) * (n - 1) + 1 = m - (m/n) + 1. But hold on, that is m*(1 - 1/n) + 1, which simplifies to m - m/n + 1.

Wait, let's check with an example. Let’s take G = S_3, and H = {e, (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}, a cyclic subgroup of order 3. But S_3 has order 6, so m=6, n=3.

But H is normal in S_3, since index 2, but in the problem H is a proper subgroup with conjugates intersecting only at e. Wait, H in S_3 is normal, so all conjugates are H itself, so the union would just be H, which has 3 elements. But according to the formula m - m/n +1 = 6 - 6/3 +1 = 6 - 2 +1 = 5, which is wrong. So clearly, my formula is flawed.

But in this case, because H is normal, all conjugates are the same, so union is H itself. But in the problem setup, the condition that H^x ∩ H = {e} when x ∉ H would not hold if H is normal, since then H^x = H for all x, hence for x ∉ H, H^x ∩ H = H, which is not just {e}. Therefore, in the problem's setup, H cannot be normal. Thus, such groups where this condition holds must have H not normal, and all its conjugates intersect H only at e. 

So in such cases, when we have multiple conjugates, each overlapping only at e, the union would be as I thought. However, in the normal case, that doesn't hold, which is consistent because in the problem's conditions H is not normal.

So assuming that all conjugates of H intersect each other only at e, which we proved above, then the union's cardinality would be:

Number of conjugates * (size of H - 1) + 1.

Because each conjugate has n elements, shares only the identity with others, so n - 1 new elements per conjugate.

Number of conjugates is [G : H] = m/n. So it's (m/n)*(n - 1) +1= m - m/n +1.

But in the problem statement, let me verify with the condition. Let's take an example.

Take G = S_3, and H = {e, (12)}, which is a subgroup of order 2. Let's check if for x ∉ H, H^x ∩ H = {e}. 

The conjugates of H in S3 are {e, (12)}, {e, (13)}, {e, (23)}. Take x = (13), which is not in H. Then H^x = {e, (13)(12)(13)} = {e, (23)}. Then H^x ∩ H = {e}, so satisfies the condition. Similarly, for x = (23), H^x = {e, (23)(12)(23)} = {e, (13)}, and intersection is also {e}. Similarly, for x=(123), it's more complicated. Let's conjugate H by (123).

First, (123)H(123)^{-1} = { (123)e(123)^{-1}, (123)(12)(123)^{-1 } } = {e, (23)}. So the conjugate is {e, (23)}. The intersection with H is still {e}. So yes, all conjugates generated by elements not in H meet H only at e.

So in this example, H has three conjugates, each with 2 elements. Their union is {e, (12), (13), (23)}}, which has 4 elements. According to the formula, m = 6, n = 2, so 6/2 = 3 conjugates. (6/2)*(2 -1) +1= 3*1 +1=4, which matches.

Similarly, in the example we have 4 elements, which is correct.

So the formula |U| = (m/n)(n -1) +1 seems to hold here. So in general, since the problem's conditions enforce that all distinct conjugates intersect only at e, then the formula is as above. Therefore, the answer should be (m/n)(n -1) +1, which simplifies to m - m/n +1. But let me verify the calculation again.

Number of conjugates is m/n. Each conjugate has n elements. The intersection of any two conjugates is {e}, so the total union is:

First conjugate contributes n elements.

Each subsequent conjugate contributes n - 1 new elements (since e is already counted).

Hence total elements = n + ( (m/n -1)*(n -1) )

Which is n + (m/n -1)(n -1) = n + ( (m/n)(n -1) - (n -1) ) = n + m(n -1)/n - (n -1)

= n - (n -1) + m(n -1)/n

= 1 + m(n -1)/n

Which is the same as (m(n -1))/n +1. Yes, that's equal to m - m/n +1, since m(n -1)/n = m - m/n.

Therefore, both forms are acceptable. So writing either m - m/n +1 or 1 + m(n -1)/n, but the simplest form would be m - m/n +1.

Wait, but 1 + m(n -1)/n is equal to (n + m(n -1))/n = (n + mn -m)/n = (mn -m + n)/n = m(n -1) + n)/n. But perhaps there's a better way to write it. Maybe m - (m -n)/n? Wait, m - m/n +1 = (m n - m)/n +1 = (m(n -1) ) /n +1, which is the same as above.

Alternatively, |U| = (m - m/n) +1. Maybe that's acceptable.

But let's also verify with our example: m =6, n=2. m - m/n +1=6 -3 +1=4, correct. Another example, m=6, H of order 3 (if possible). But in our previous example with n=3, but in S_3, subgroups of order 3 are normal, but in problem conditions, the H is such that H^x ∩ H={e} for x ∉ H, so not normal. Wait, but if H is order 3 in S_3, then conjugating gives same subgroup, but H is normal, hence in that case, H^x is always H, so the intersection with H is H, which contradicts the problem's condition. Hence such a subgroup H of order 3 cannot satisfy the condition. So in S_3, the possible H must be non-normal, of order 2.

In general, the formula |U| = m - m/n +1 seems correct.

But wait, in the case where m = n +1? That can't happen unless H is the whole group, but H is a proper subgroup. So m must be larger.

Alternatively, let's check another group. Take G = A4, which has 12 elements. Let H be a subgroup of order 3. But A4's subgroups of order 3 are Sylow subgroups, each isomorphic to C3. The number of conjugates is 4, since the Sylow 3-subgroups are 4 in A4. However, these subgroups intersect trivially? Wait, in A4, any two Sylow 3-subgroups intersect trivially, right?

Wait, the Sylow 3-subgroups in A4 have order 3, and each is generated by a 3-cycle. The intersection of two different 3-cycles would be trivial because they generate different subgroups. So if H is a Sylow 3-subgroup in A4, then conjugates are other 3-cycles, so the union would be all the 3-cycles (8 elements) plus the identity. Wait, but since each conjugate has 3 elements (including identity), the number of elements.

Wait, no. Each Sylow 3-subgroup in A4 is {e, (123), (132)}. There are 4 such subgroups. Their union would be {e, all the 3-cycles}. There are 8 3-cycles in A4 plus the identity, so union has 9 elements. Therefore, according to the formula: m =12, n=3. Then |U| =12 -12/3 +1=12 -4 +1=9, which matches. Yes, that works.

Therefore, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the answer for part (b) is m - m/n +1, which simplifies to m - (m/n) +1. Alternatively, written as (m(n -1))/n +1, but m - m/n +1 is simplest. Therefore, the number of elements in the union of all conjugates is \( m - \frac{m}{n} + 1 \).

I think that's right. Let me confirm one last example.

Take G= D4, the dihedral group of order 8, and H a non-normal subgroup of order 2. Let’s say H is generated by a reflection. Then, the number of conjugates of H in D4 is 2 or 4?

In D4, conjugacy classes of reflections: there are two classes, each with two reflections, assuming H is one reflection. Wait, actually, in D4, generated by r (rotation) and s (reflection), the elements are {e, r, r2, r3, s, sr, sr2, sr3}. The reflections are {s, sr, sr2, sr3}. Depending on the presentation, sometimes reflections conjugate among themselves. If H = {e, s}, then conjugating by r gives {e, sr2}, conjugating by r2 gives {e, s}, conjugating by r3 gives {e, sr2}, conjugating by sr would give... hmm, let me double-check.

But actually in D4, the conjugacy classes: the reflections fall into two conjugacy classes: {s, sr2} and {sr, sr3}. So if H is {e, s}, then H^x would be {e, s} when x is in H or perhaps? Wait, no.

Wait, if H is {e, s}, then conjugating by r would give {e, r s r−1} = {e, sr2}, so conjugate H by r is {e, sr2}. Similarly, conjugating r again would give {e, s}.

Therefore, there are two conjugates: {e, s} and {e, sr2}. So the number of conjugates is 2. Then [G : H] = 8/2 =4, but since the normalizer of H in G? Wait, because if you have H = {e, s}, then normalizer N_G(H): what elements g in G satisfy gHg^{-1} = H. Since H has two elements: e and s. So g s g^{-1} must be s or e. But e is fixed. So g must satisfy g s g^{-1} =s. So that elements that commute with s. s is a reflection, which in D4 commute only with itself, and the identity and maybe some others. Wait, in D4, does the center include sr2? Wait, the center of D4 is {e, r2}. So Z(G)= {e, r2}. So s does not commute with r or r^3. But s does commute with s and sr2. Wait, if we take g ∈ N_G(H), then g s g^{-1} ∈ H. H is {e, s}, so g must satisfy g s g^{-1} = s or e. But e is not possible unless g s g^{-1} =e, but that would mean s=e, which is false. Therefore, N_G(H) = {g | g s g^{-1} =s } = centralizer of s in G. Which in D4, the centralizer of s is {e, s, r2, sr2}. Therefore, the normalizer N_G(H) is of order 4. Then number of conjugates [G : N_G(H)] =8/4=2. So two conjugates, so union's size is 2*(2-1) +1=3. However, in reality, the union of H and its conjugate H^r = {e, sr2}, their union is {e, s, sr2}, which has 3 elements. Correct, which matches.

But according to our formula, m=8, n=2, gives |U|=8 -8/2 +1=8 -4 +1=5. Wait, this is a discrepancy!

Wait, wait, contradiction here. In our problem, we assumed that H^x ∩ H ={e} for x ∉ H. But in this D4 example, when x = r2, H^{r2} = {e, r2 s r^{-2}} = {e, s}, which is H itself. So the conjugate by x=r2 is H itself. But r2 is in N_G(H) \ H, since H has order 2, and normalizer has order 4. So according to the problem's condition, for x in G - H, H^x ∩ H = {e}, but in D4 we have some x not in H (for example, x = r2) for which H^x = H, hence H^x ∩ H = H. So the problem's setup is not satisfied here.

Therefore, such an H in D4 (subgroup of order 2 generated by a reflection) does not satisfy the problem's condition. Therefore, in order to find valid examples, we must have that the normalizer of H is H itself, which in the previous S3 case that's true when H is a non-normal subgroup.

Therefore, H can only be such that N_G(H) = H, so the number of conjugates is [G:H]. This is ensured by the problem's conditions since H^x ∩ H = {e} for x ∉ H, as in, an element outside H doesn't normalize H. Hence, for those groups/math setups where the given conditions hold: H is a proper subgroup with the property that any conjugate of H by an element not in H intersects H only in e. Then, N_G(H)= H. Thus, the number of conjugates is [G:H].

Therefore, coming back to D4: If we can’t use H the subgroup generated by a reflection because it does not satisfy the problem's condition. So perhaps consider another group.

But anyway, in the problem's case, since N_G(H)=H, so number of conjugates is m/n. Each conjugate has order n, pairwise intersections {e}. So the formula |U|=(m/n)*(n-1)+1 holds.

Hence, part (b) answer is that the number of elements is \( m - \frac{m}{n} + 1 \). This expression can also be written as \( \frac{m(n -1)}{n} + 1 \), but simplifying, \( m - \frac{m}{n} + 1 \) is more straightforward.

Therefore, the final answer should be \( m - \frac{m}{n} + 1 \).

Hence:

For part (a), we proved H^x = H^y iff x^{-1}y ∈ H using the problem's conditions.

For part (b), the number of elements in the union is \( m - \frac{m}{n} +1 \).

**Final Answer**

a) \boxed{H^x = H^y \text{ if and only if } x^{-1}y \in H}

b) \boxed{m - \dfrac{m}{n} + 1}

<definition>The ability to identify recurring structures, relationships, or regularities in mathematical objects or processes, allowing for generalization and abstraction.</definition>

<start>5207</start>
<end>5381</end>
<text>Therefore, the union U is the union of [G : H] = m/n subgroups, each of size n, and pairwise intersecting only at e. Therefore, the total number of elements in U is:

Number of conjugates * (size of each conjugate - 1) + 1</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes a pattern in how the elements of the union are distributed, identifying that each conjugate contributes (n-1) new elements plus the shared identity element, which leads to a general counting formula.</explanation>

<start>5382</start>
<end>5485</end>
<text>Because all conjugates share the identity element, so we have to subtract 1 for each conjugate after the first one.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes the pattern of overlap between the conjugate subgroups, specifically that they all share exactly one element (the identity), which is crucial for correctly counting the union.</explanation>

<start>6891</start>
<end>7093</end>
<text>Number of conjugates is m/n. Each conjugate has n elements. The intersection of any two conjugates is {e}, so the total union is:

First conjugate contributes n elements.

Each subsequent conjugate contributes n - 1 new elements (since e is already counted).</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes the pattern in how elements contribute to the union, breaking down the counting process into a clear structure that accounts for the overlap pattern between conjugates.</explanation>

<skill>Verification through Examples</skill>
<definition>The ability to test and validate mathematical hypotheses or formulas by applying them to specific, concrete examples and checking if the results match expectations.</definition>

<start>5728</start>
<end>6097</end>
<text>Wait, let's check with an example. Let's take G = S_3, and H = {e, (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}, a cyclic subgroup of order 3. But S_3 has order 6, so m=6, n=3.

But H is normal in S_3, since index 2, but in the problem H is a proper subgroup with conjugates intersecting only at e. Wait, H in S_3 is normal, so all conjugates are H itself, so the union would just be H, which has 3 elements. But according to the formula m - m/n +1 = 6 - 6/3 +1 = 6 - 2 +1 = 5, which is wrong.</text>
<explanation>The solver tests their formula with a specific example (S₃ with a subgroup of order 3), realizes the formula gives an incorrect result, and identifies that the example doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions, showing the importance of verification.</explanation>

<start>7765</start>
<end>8223</end>
<text>Wait, no. Each Sylow 3-subgroup in A4 is {e, (123), (132)}. There are 4 such subgroups. Their union would be {e, all the 3-cycles}. There are 8 3-cycles in A4 plus the identity, so union has 9 elements. Therefore, according to the formula: m =12, n=3. Then |U| =12 -12/3 +1=12 -4 +1=9, which matches. Yes, that works.

Therefore, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the answer for part (b) is m - m/n +1, which simplifies to m - (m/n) +1.</text>
<explanation>The solver tests their formula with a specific example (A₄ with Sylow 3-subgroups), calculates both the actual size of the union and the result from their formula, and confirms they match, validating their solution.</explanation>

<start>8426</start>
<end>8854</end>
<text>Therefore, there are two conjugates: {e, s} and {e, sr2}. So the number of conjugates is 2. Then [G : H] = 8/2 =4, but since the normalizer of H in G? Wait, because if you have H = {e, s}, then normalizer N_G(H): what elements g in G satisfy gHg^{-1} = H. Since H has two elements: e and s. So g s g^{-1} must be s or e. But e is fixed. So g must satisfy g s g^{-1} =s. So that elements that commute with s. s is a reflection, which in D4 commute only with itself, and the identity and maybe some others.</text>
<explanation>The solver tests their understanding with a detailed example from D₄, working through the specific elements and conjugation relationships to verify their understanding of normalizers and conjugate subgroups.</explanation>

<skill>Metacognitive Monitoring</skill>
<definition>The ability to actively monitor one's own thinking processes, identify errors or gaps in reasoning, and adjust strategies accordingly.</definition>

<start>2224</start>
<end>2429</end>
<text>Wait, hold on. The problem also gives another condition: for all \( x \in G - H \), \( H^x \cap H = \{e\} \). Maybe we need to use this condition.

Wait, but I need to check part (a). But part (a) doesn't mention the condition about the intersection, except maybe indirectly?</text>
<explanation>The solver realizes they may have overlooked a key condition from the problem statement and pauses to reconsider whether this condition is relevant to solving part (a), showing active monitoring of their solution approach.</explanation>

<start>5486</start>
<end>5727</end>
<text>So, the formula would be:

|U| = (m/n) * (n - 1) + 1 = m - (m/n) + 1. But hold on, that is m*(1 - 1/n) + 1, which simplifies to m - m/n + 1.

Wait, let's check with an example. Let's take G = S_3, and H = {e, (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}, a cyclic subgroup of order 3.</text>
<explanation>The solver derives a formula but immediately questions it, deciding to verify it with an example. This shows metacognitive monitoring as they recognize the need to validate their mathematical derivation.</explanation>

<start>9241</start>
<end>9594</end>
<text>Wait, wait, contradiction here. In our problem, we assumed that H^x ∩ H ={e} for x ∉ H. But in this D4 example, when x = r2, H^{r2} = {e, r2 s r^{-2}} = {e, s}, which is H itself. So the conjugate by x=r2 is H itself. But r2 is in N_G(H) \ H, since H has order 2, and normalizer has order 4. So according to the problem's condition, for x in G - H, H^x ∩ H = {e}, but in D4 we have some x not in H (for example, x = r2) for which H^x = H</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies a contradiction in their example, recognizing that the D₄ example doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions. This demonstrates strong metacognitive monitoring as they catch their own error and adjust their understanding.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Synthesis</skill>
<definition>The ability to integrate multiple mathematical concepts, techniques, or results to form a coherent solution or insight, often connecting different areas of mathematics.</definition>

<start>2723</start>
<end>3010</end>
<text>Suppose x is not in H. Then, if x were in N_G(H), then H^x = H. But H^x ∩ H = {e}. But since H is a subgroup, if H^x = H, then H^x ∩ H = H. Therefore, unless H is trivial, this can't happen. Therefore, N_G(H) = H, because if any element x outside H normalizes H, then H^x would equal H, which would contradict the condition H^x ∩ H = {e} (unless H is trivial).</text>
<explanation>The solver synthesizes concepts of normalizers, conjugate subgroups, and the problem's intersection condition to derive the crucial insight that N_G(H) = H, connecting these group-theoretic concepts to advance the solution.</explanation>

<start>5108</start>
<end>5206</end>
<text>Therefore, only the identity is in the intersection of two distinct conjugates of H. Therefore, all the conjugates H^x intersect each other only at e.</text>
<explanation>The solver synthesizes their previous deductions to establish a key property about the structure of conjugate subgroups in this problem, which becomes essential for counting the elements in their union.</explanation>

<start>9595</start>
<end>9939</end>
<text>Hence H^x ∩ H = H. So the problem's setup is not satisfied here.

Therefore, such an H in D4 (subgroup of order 2 generated by a reflection) does not satisfy the problem's condition. Therefore, in order to find valid examples, we must have that the normalizer of H is H itself, which in the previous S3 case that's true when H is a non-normal subgroup.

Therefore, H can only be such that N_G(H) = H, so the number of conjugates is [G:H].</text>
<explanation>The solver synthesizes their findings from multiple examples to formulate a general characterization of subgroups that satisfy the problem's conditions, connecting the concepts of normalizers, conjugates, and the intersection property.</explanation>
