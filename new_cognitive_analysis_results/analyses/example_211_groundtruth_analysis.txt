Problem:
(d) The one-dimensional diffusion equation (also called the "heat equation") is given (for a free particle) by

$$
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=a \frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial x^{2}}
\tag{5}
$$

A spatial wave can be written as $\sim e^{i k x}$ (larger $k$ 's correspond to waves oscillating on smaller length scales). Guessing a solution $\psi(x, t)=A e^{i k x-i \omega t}$, find $\omega$ in terms of k. A relationship of this time is called a "dispersion relation."

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Consider the given differential equation:

$$
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=a \frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial x^{2}}
\tag{28}
$$

We can plug in $\psi(x, t)=A e^{i k x-i \omega t}$ to find

$$
-i \omega A e^{i k x-i \omega t}=-k^{2} a A e^{i k x-i \omega t}
\tag{29}
$$

so that

$$
\omega=-i k^{2} a
\tag{30}
$$

# Analysis of Cognitive Skills in Mathematical Problem-Solving

<skill>Mathematical Substitution</skill>
<definition>The ability to replace variables or expressions with specific values or functions in mathematical equations to simplify or solve problems.</definition>

<start>45</start>
<end>94</end>
<text>We can plug in $\psi(x, t)=A e^{i k x-i \omega t}$ to find</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates substitution by taking the guessed solution form and explicitly stating they will plug it into the original differential equation. This is a fundamental technique in solving differential equations where an ansatz (educated guess) is substituted to verify if it satisfies the equation.</explanation>

<skill>Differentiation</skill>
<definition>The ability to apply derivative operations to functions to determine rates of change, which is essential for solving differential equations.</definition>

<text>$$
-i \omega A e^{i k x-i \omega t}=-k^{2} a A e^{i k x-i \omega t}
\tag{29}
$$</text>
<explanation>This line shows the result after computing the partial derivatives. The solver has implicitly differentiated the guessed solution with respect to time (left side: ∂ψ/∂t giving -iω term) and twice with respect to space (right side: ∂²ψ/∂x² giving -k² term). This demonstrates the ability to correctly apply differentiation rules to exponential functions.</explanation>

<skill>Equation Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to rearrange, simplify, or transform equations to isolate variables or derive new relationships while maintaining mathematical equivalence.</definition>

<start>177</start>
<end>214</end>
<text>so that

$$
\omega=-i k^{2} a
\tag{30}
$$</text>
<explanation>The solver manipulates the equation from step (29) to isolate ω. They recognize that since the exponential terms appear on both sides of the equation, they can be canceled out. Then they solve for ω by dividing both sides by -iA and rearranging to get the final dispersion relation. This demonstrates algebraic manipulation skills to derive the requested relationship.</explanation>

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>

\tag{29}
$$

so that

$$
\omega=-i k^{2} a
\tag{30}
$$</text>
<explanation>The entire solution process demonstrates mathematical insight as the solver immediately recognizes that the exponential form given in the problem is precisely the type of solution that works for this class of differential equations. They efficiently move from the equation to the dispersion relation without unnecessary steps, showing a deep understanding of how wave-like solutions behave in diffusion equations.</explanation>
