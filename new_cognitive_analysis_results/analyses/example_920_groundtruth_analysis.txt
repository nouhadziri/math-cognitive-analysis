Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
To prove the given integral identity, we will follow the steps outlined in the proposed solution and provide detailed calculations and justifications.

1. **Express the integral as a difference of two integrals:**
   \[
   I = \int_{\pi/6}^{\pi/3} \frac{x}{\sin x} \, dx = I_1 - I_2,
   \]
   where
   \[
   I_1 = \int_0^{\pi/3} \frac{x}{\sin x} \, dx \quad \text{and} \quad I_2 = \int_0^{\pi/6} \frac{x}{\sin x} \, dx.
   \]

2. **Evaluate \( I_2 \):**
   According to the reference provided, we have:
   \[
   I_2 = \frac{4C}{3} - \frac{\pi}{6} \ln(2 + \sqrt{3}),
   \]
   where \( C = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)^2} \) is the Catalan constant.

3. **Evaluate \( I_1 \) using integration by parts:**
   Let \( u = x \) and \( dv = \frac{dx}{\sin x} \). Then \( du = dx \) and \( v = \ln(\tan(x/2)) \). Applying integration by parts:
   \[
   I_1 = \left. x \ln(\tan(x/2)) \right|_0^{\pi/3} - \int_0^{\pi/3} \ln(\tan(x/2)) \, dx.
   \]
   Evaluating the boundary term:
   \[
   \left. x \ln(\tan(x/2)) \right|_0^{\pi/3} = \frac{\pi}{3} \ln(\tan(\pi/6)) = \frac{\pi}{3} \ln\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = -\frac{\pi}{6} \ln 3.
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   I_1 = -\frac{\pi}{6} \ln 3 - J,
   \]
   where
   \[
   J = \int_0^{\pi/3} \ln(\tan(x/2)) \, dx.
   \]

4. **Evaluate \( J \) using substitution:**
   Let \( \sqrt{3} \tan(x/2) = t \). Then \( x = 2 \tan^{-1}(t/\sqrt{3}) \) and \( dx = \frac{2 \, dt}{\sqrt{3}(1 + t^2/3)} \). The limits change from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = \pi/3 \) to \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \). Thus,
   \[
   J = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \int_0^1 \frac{\ln(t/\sqrt{3})}{1 + t^2/3} \, dt.
   \]
   This can be split into two integrals:
   \[
   J = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \int_0^1 \frac{\ln t}{1 + t^2/3} \, dt - \frac{\ln 3}{\sqrt{3}} \int_0^1 \frac{dt}{1 + t^2/3}.
   \]
   The second integral is:
   \[
   \int_0^1 \frac{dt}{1 + t^2/3} = \sqrt{3} \int_0^1 \frac{dt}{\sqrt{3} + t^2} = \sqrt{3} \left[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{t}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \right]_0^1 = \frac{\pi}{6}.
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   J = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \int_0^1 \frac{\ln t}{1 + t^2/3} \, dt - \frac{\pi}{6} \ln 3.
   \]

5. **Evaluate the series representation of the integral:**
   Using the series expansion \( \frac{1}{1 + t^2/3} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(-\frac{t^2}{3}\right)^n \), we get:
   \[
   \int_0^1 \frac{\ln t}{1 + t^2/3} \, dt = \int_0^1 \ln t \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(-\frac{t^2}{3}\right)^n \, dt = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)^n \int_0^1 t^{2n} \ln t \, dt.
   \]
   The integral \( \int_0^1 t^{2n} \ln t \, dt \) is evaluated using integration by parts:
   \[
   \int_0^1 t^{2n} \ln t \, dt = \left[ \frac{t^{2n+1} \ln t}{2n+1} \right]_0^1 - \int_0^1 \frac{t^{2n+1}}{2n+1} \, dt = -\frac{1}{(2n+1)^2}.
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \int_0^1 \frac{\ln t}{1 + t^2/3} \, dt = -\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{3^n (2n+1)^2}.
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   J = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{3^n (2n+1)^2} - \frac{\pi}{6} \ln 3.
   \]

6. **Combine the results:**
   \[
   I_1 = -\frac{\pi}{6} \ln 3 - J = -\frac{\pi}{6} \ln 3 + \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{3^n (2n+1)^2} + \frac{\pi}{6} \ln 3 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{3^n (2n+1)^2}.
   \]

7. **Final expression for \( I \):**
   \[
   I = I_1 - I_2 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{3^n (2n+1)^2} - \left( \frac{4C}{3} - \frac{\pi}{6} \ln(2 + \sqrt{3}) \right).
   \]

8. **Simplify the final result:**
   \[
   I = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{3^n (2n+1)^2} - \frac{4C}{3} + \frac{\pi}{6} \ln(2 + \sqrt{3}).
   \]

Thus, we have proved the given integral identity.
