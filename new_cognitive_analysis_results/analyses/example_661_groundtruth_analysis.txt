Problem:
An ellipse has foci at $(9, 20)$ and $(49, 55)$ in the $xy$ -plane and is tangent to the $x$ -axis. What is the length of its major axis?

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
85

Analysis:
I need to analyze the cognitive skills demonstrated in the provided solution to the ellipse problem. However, the thinking trajectory provided is extremely minimal, containing only the answer "85" without any workings or explanation. This makes it challenging to identify specific cognitive skills from the solution process.

Since I don't have access to the solver's actual thinking process, I can only make limited observations based on the correct answer provided.

<explanation>The correct answer of 85 indicates the solver must have retrieved and applied the formula for an ellipse, particularly understanding that the length of the major axis equals 2a, where a is the semi-major axis. The solver likely recalled that for an ellipse, if c is the distance from the center to a focus, and a is the semi-major axis, then a^2 = b^2 + c^2, where b is the semi-minor axis. Additionally, they would have needed to know that for any point on the ellipse, the sum of distances to the two foci equals 2a.</explanation>

<explanation>Arriving at the correct answer suggests the solver visualized the ellipse in the coordinate plane, understood the geometric meaning of the foci, and correctly determined how the tangency condition with the x-axis constrains the ellipse. This requires spatial reasoning to mentally position the ellipse and understand its orientation relative to the coordinate system.</explanation>

<explanation>The correct answer indicates the solver successfully worked with the coordinates of the foci (9,20) and (49,55) to determine properties of the ellipse. This likely involved finding the center of the ellipse, calculating the distance between foci, and applying the tangency condition to determine the semi-minor axis length.</explanation>

<explanation>To arrive at the answer of 85, the solver likely decomposed the problem into steps: (1) finding the center of the ellipse, (2) calculating the distance between foci, (3) determining how the tangency condition constrains the ellipse, and (4) applying the appropriate formula to find the major axis length.</explanation>
