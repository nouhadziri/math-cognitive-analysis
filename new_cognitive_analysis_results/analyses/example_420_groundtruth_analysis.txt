<text>112</text>
<explanation>The solver has arrived at the specific numerical answer of 112, which demonstrates their ability to work with precise numerical values and understand their properties in the context of the inequality. This shows number sense in identifying the exact integer that satisfies the given constraints.</explanation>

<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>112</text>
<explanation>Although the thinking trajectory only shows the final answer, reaching this answer would require manipulating the inequality $\frac{8}{15} < \frac{n}{n + k} < \frac{7}{13}$ to determine constraints on n and k. The solver would need to rearrange terms, cross-multiply, and solve for the variables to arrive at 112 as the answer.</explanation>

<definition>The ability to compare and understand the relative sizes of fractions, including converting fractions to common forms for comparison.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>112</text>
<explanation>The problem involves comparing the fraction $\frac{n}{n + k}$ with the bounds $\frac{8}{15}$ and $\frac{7}{13}$. Finding the solution requires understanding how these fractions relate to each other and how changing the values of n and k affects their relationship.</explanation>

<skill>Constraint Satisfaction</skill>
<definition>The ability to find values that simultaneously satisfy multiple constraints or conditions in a problem.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>112</text>
<explanation>The problem requires finding a value of n for which there is exactly one integer k satisfying the given inequality. This involves understanding how the constraints interact and finding the specific value that meets all conditions simultaneously.</explanation>

<skill>Optimization</skill>
<definition>The ability to find maximum or minimum values that satisfy given constraints.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>112</text>
<explanation>The problem asks for the "largest positive integer n," which is an optimization problem. The solver needed to determine not just any value that works, but specifically the maximum possible value, which they identified as 112.</explanation>

<definition>The ability to determine when a mathematical problem has exactly one solution or when a specific condition is satisfied uniquely.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>112</text>
<explanation>The problem specifically asks for n where there is a "unique integer k" satisfying the inequality. This requires analyzing when exactly one value of k works for a given n, which is a sophisticated form of mathematical reasoning about uniqueness.</explanation>
