Problem:
A scientist studies the stress response of barley to increased temperatures and finds a protein which contributes to heat tolerance through the stabilisation of cell membrane. The scientist is very happy and wants to create a heat-tolerant cultivar of diploid wheat. Using databases, they find a heat tolerance protein homologue and start analysing its accumulation under heat stress. Soon enough, the scientist discovers this protein is not synthesised in the wheat cultivar they study. There are many possible reasons for such behaviour, including:
Answer Choices:
(A) The proteolysis process disrupts a quaternary structure of the protein, preserving only a tertiary structure
(B) A stop-codon occurs in the 5’-UTR region of the gene encoding the target protein
(C) A miRNA targets the protein, which makes exonucleases cut it immediately after the end of translation and before processing in ER
(D) Trimethylation of lysine of H3 histone in position 27 at the promoter of the gene encoding the target protein

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
The correct answer is “Trimethylation of lysine of H3 histone in position 27 at the promoter of the gene encoding the target protein” because, according to the known properties of the histone code, trimethylation of H3K27 leads to repression of gene expression, which would prevent protein synthesis.
Incorrect answers:
“The proteolysis process disrupts a quaternary structure of the protein preserving only a tertiary structure” – proteolysis targets peptide bonds while a quaternary structure of proteins is mostly maintained through non-covalent interactions. Also, proteolysis targets a primary structure, making preserving the tertiary structure impossible.
“A stop-codon occurs in the 5’-UTR region of the gene encoding the target protein” – as 5’-UTR is an untranslated region, there is no reason why stop-codon in this region would stop protein translation.
“A miRNA targets the protein, which makes exonucleases cut it immediately after the end of translation and before processing in ER” – miRNAs do not target proteins, and exonucleases do not cut them.

Answer: D

<text>according to the known properties of the histone code, trimethylation of H3K27 leads to repression of gene expression, which would prevent protein synthesis</text>
<explanation>The solver applies specialized knowledge about epigenetic mechanisms, specifically understanding that trimethylation of H3K27 (lysine 27 on histone H3) is a repressive mark that prevents gene expression. This is advanced domain knowledge in molecular biology and epigenetics that allows them to correctly identify the mechanism that would prevent protein synthesis.</explanation>

<text>proteolysis targets peptide bonds while a quaternary structure of proteins is mostly maintained through non-covalent interactions. Also, proteolysis targets a primary structure, making preserving the tertiary structure impossible</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates detailed knowledge of protein structure and proteolysis. They understand the hierarchy of protein structures (primary, tertiary, quaternary), the nature of bonds that maintain these structures, and how proteolysis specifically affects them. This specialized biochemistry knowledge allows them to evaluate why option A is incorrect.</explanation>

<end>667</end>
<text>as 5'-UTR is an untranslated region, there is no reason why stop-codon in this region would stop protein translation</text>
<explanation>The solver applies knowledge about gene structure and translation mechanisms, specifically understanding that the 5'-UTR (5' untranslated region) is not translated into protein, making a stop codon in this region irrelevant to protein synthesis. This demonstrates specialized knowledge in molecular biology and genetics.</explanation>

<start>669</start>
<end>751</end>
<text>miRNAs do not target proteins, and exonucleases do not cut them</text>
<explanation>The solver applies knowledge about miRNA function and exonuclease activity, correctly identifying that miRNAs target mRNAs (not proteins) and that exonucleases degrade nucleic acids (not proteins). This demonstrates specialized knowledge in molecular biology and gene regulation mechanisms.</explanation>

<skill>Critical Evaluation</skill>
<definition>The ability to assess the validity, accuracy, or quality of information, arguments, or solutions. This includes identifying flaws in reasoning, inconsistencies, or contradictions.</definition>

<start>180</start>
<end>751</end>
<text>Incorrect answers:
"The proteolysis process disrupts a quaternary structure of the protein preserving only a tertiary structure" – proteolysis targets peptide bonds while a quaternary structure of proteins is mostly maintained through non-covalent interactions. Also, proteolysis targets a primary structure, making preserving the tertiary structure impossible.
"A stop-codon occurs in the 5'-UTR region of the gene encoding the target protein" – as 5'-UTR is an untranslated region, there is no reason why stop-codon in this region would stop protein translation.
"A miRNA targets the protein, which makes exonucleases cut it immediately after the end of translation and before processing in ER" – miRNAs do not target proteins, and exonucleases do not cut them.</text>
<explanation>The solver systematically evaluates each incorrect answer option, identifying specific scientific inaccuracies or logical flaws in each one. For each option, they pinpoint exactly why the proposed mechanism would not explain the observed phenomenon (protein not being synthesized). This demonstrates a methodical approach to critically evaluating multiple possibilities against established scientific principles.</explanation>

<skill>Logical Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to form conclusions, judgments, or inferences from facts or premises. This includes deductive reasoning (applying general principles to specific cases) and inductive reasoning (deriving general principles from specific observations).</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>179</end>
<text>The correct answer is "Trimethylation of lysine of H3 histone in position 27 at the promoter of the gene encoding the target protein" because, according to the known properties of the histone code, trimethylation of H3K27 leads to repression of gene expression, which would prevent protein synthesis.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses deductive reasoning to connect the general principle (H3K27 trimethylation represses gene expression) to the specific case (the protein is not being synthesized in wheat). They form a logical chain: if H3K27 trimethylation represses gene expression, and gene expression is necessary for protein synthesis, then H3K27 trimethylation would prevent protein synthesis, which matches the observed phenomenon.</explanation>

<start>537</start>
<end>667</end>
<text>as 5'-UTR is an untranslated region, there is no reason why stop-codon in this region would stop protein translation</text>
<explanation>The solver uses logical reasoning to deduce that a stop codon in an untranslated region cannot affect translation. The reasoning follows: if the 5'-UTR is not translated (premise), then a stop codon in this region would not be read by the translation machinery (logical inference), therefore it cannot cause translation termination (conclusion).</explanation>

<skill>Elimination Strategy</skill>
<definition>A problem-solving approach where incorrect options are systematically identified and removed, narrowing down the possible solutions until the correct answer remains.</definition>

<start>180</start>
