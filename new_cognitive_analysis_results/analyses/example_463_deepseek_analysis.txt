Problem:
Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set $\lbrace1,2,3,\ldots,10\rbrace$ Let $n$ be the number of sets of two non-empty disjoint subsets of $\mathcal{S}$ . (Disjoint sets are defined as sets that have no common elements.) Find the remainder obtained when $n$ is divided by $1000$ .

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Alright, so I need to figure out how many sets of two non-empty disjoint subsets of the set S = {1,2,3,...,10} there are. And then find the remainder when that number is divided by 1000. Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem statement again. We have the set S with elements from 1 to 10. We are to find the number of sets (which are unordered) consisting of two non-empty, disjoint subsets of S. Disjoint here means that the two subsets have no elements in common. And since we're talking about sets of subsets, the order doesn't matter. So, for example, if A and B are two such subsets, then the set {A, B} is the same as {B, A}, so we don't want to count those twice.

Okay, so to approach this, maybe I can first think about ordered pairs of disjoint subsets and then adjust for the overcounting due to order. Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Another idea: each element in S can be in one of three states relative to the two subsets. Either it's in the first subset, or in the second subset, or in neither. But since the subsets must be non-empty and disjoint, we need to exclude the cases where all elements are in neither subset or all elements are assigned to only one subset.

Wait, maybe using inclusion-exclusion here? Let's see.

For each element, we can assign it to be in subset A, subset B, or neither. So for each of the 10 elements, there are 3 choices. So that would be 3^10 total possible assignments. However, this counts ordered pairs (A, B) where A and B could be empty. But the problem specifies that both subsets must be non-empty and disjoint.

So to account for the non-empty condition, we have to subtract the cases where A is empty or B is empty. But since A and B are in ordered pairs, if we subtract the cases where A is empty and the cases where B is empty, we might be over-subtracting the case where both are empty. Wait, but since we are considering ordered pairs, actually the number of ordered pairs (A, B) where A and B are disjoint (possibly empty) is 3^10. Then the number of ordered pairs where both A and B are non-empty and disjoint would be 3^10 - 2^10 - 2^10 + 1, applying inclusion-exclusion. Because:

Total: 3^10

Subtract the cases where A is empty: 2^10 (since each element must be in B or neither)

Subtract the cases where B is empty: 2^10 (each element in A or neither)

But now we've subtracted the case where both A and B are empty twice, so we need to add it back once. That case is 1 (all elements are in neither). So the formula is:

3^10 - 2*2^10 + 1 = 3^10 - 2^{11} + 1

Calculate this value:

First, compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049

Next, compute 2^11. 2^10=1024, so 2^11=2048

Hence, 59049 - 2048 + 1 = 59049 - 2048 is 57001, then +1 is 57002.

Wait, hold on. Let me check that arithmetic again:

59,049 - 2,048:

Start with 59,049 - 2,000 = 57,049

Then subtract 48 more: 57,049 - 48 = 57,001

Then add 1: 57,001 +1 = 57,002. Right, so 57,002 ordered pairs (A, B) where A and B are non-empty disjoint subsets.

But the problem is asking for the number of sets {A, B}, which are unordered. So each unordered pair is counted twice in the ordered pairs, except when A = B. Wait, but since A and B are disjoint and non-empty, A cannot equal B unless A and B are both empty, which they aren't. So, for each unordered pair {A, B}, there are two ordered pairs: (A, B) and (B, A). Therefore, the number of unordered pairs would be 57,002 / 2 = 28,501.

But before I accept that, let me verify.

Suppose we have two distinct non-empty disjoint subsets A and B. Then (A, B) and (B, A) are two different ordered pairs but correspond to the same unordered set {A, B}. However, if A and B are the same set, which would require them both to be empty, but since they have to be non-empty, this case doesn't exist. Therefore, all ordered pairs (A, B) with A ≠ B and both non-empty and disjoint correspond to unordered pairs, with each unordered pair being counted twice. Therefore, the number of unordered pairs is indeed half the number of ordered pairs.

So 57,002 divided by 2 is 28,501. Then the answer would be 28,501. Wait, but 57,002 over 2 is 28,501. Let me confirm this division: 57,002 ÷ 2: 28,500.5? Wait, no, 57,002 /2 is 28,501 exactly because 57,002 is even. Right, because 28,501 *2 =57,002. That checks out.

But now, is there a mistake because of elements being in neither A nor B?

Wait, maybe not. Since when considering ordered pairs, we already allowed elements to be in neither A nor B. But we required A and B to be non-empty. Therefore, the formula 3^10 - 2^{11} +1 gives ordered pairs where A and B are non-empty. So dividing by 2 gives the number of unordered pairs.

But let me check this with a smaller set.

Suppose S = {1}. Then S has 1 element. Then the possible subsets: any two non-empty disjoint subsets. But wait, the only non-empty subset is {1}. There are no two non-empty disjoint subsets, since the other non-empty subsets must contain 1. Wait. So n =0. Let's check according to our formula.

3^1 - 2^2 +1= 3 -4 +1=0. Then the number of unordered pairs is 0/2=0. Correct.

Another example: S={1,2}. Then 3^2 - 2^3 +1= 9 -8 +1=2. So ordered pairs:2, unordered pairs:1. Let's see. The possible unordered pairs {A,B} where A and B are non-empty and disjoint. The possible such pairs are:

{A,B} = {{1},{2}} and that's it. Also, maybe { {1}, {2} }, { {1,2}, ... } but wait, {1,2} and something else? Wait, another possible pair could be { {1}, {2} }, or perhaps { {1}, { } } but since the subsets need to be non-empty. So yes, only one unordered pair: { {1}, {2} }, right? But according to our formula, we have 2 ordered pairs: ({1}, {2}) and ({2}, {1}), but 0 others. So 2 ordered pairs, resulting in 1 unordered pair. Which matches. So that's correct. Therefore, for S={1,2}, n=1. 28,501 might be the correct answer.

But wait, the question is phrased as: "the number of sets of two non-empty disjoint subsets". So {A,B}, where A and B are non-empty, disjoint, and A ≠ B? Wait, actually, in set notation, {A,B} can't have A=B, because sets cannot have duplicate elements. Therefore, the count is indeed over pairs where A and B are distinct. But in our calculation, when we took ordered pairs (A,B) where A and B are disjoint and non-empty, then dividing by 2 gives the number of unordered pairs where A ≠ B. So our method is correct.

Wait, then, given that, 28,501 would be the answer. However, let me make sure that there isn't any mistake in the formula. Is 3^10 - 2*2^10 + 1 the correct count of ordered pairs?

Let me think. If we imagine that for each element, we choose whether it's in A, in B, or in neither. Then, each such assignment corresponds to an ordered pair (A,B) where A and B are disjoint.

But in order for both A and B to be non-empty, there must be at least one element in A and at least one element in B.

Alternatively, we can model this as all possibilities minus the ones where A is empty minus the ones where B is empty plus the case where both are empty. Wait, that's inclusion-exclusion.

Total number of ordered pairs (A,B) where A and B are disjoint: Each element can be in A, B, or neither. So 3^10. Now, from that, subtract the cases where A is empty (so all elements are in B or neither: 2^10), and subtract the cases where B is empty (so all elements are in A or neither: 2^10), but then add back the case where both A and B are empty (since we subtracted that twice). So number is 3^10 - 2*2^10 +1.

Yes, exactly. So that's 57002, as calculated earlier.

Then, since the problem asks for unordered pairs {A,B}, we need to divide the number of ordered pairs by 2 because each unordered pair is counted twice. Hence, 57002 / 2 = 28501.

Therefore, the answer is 28501. Now, we need to compute 28501 modulo 1000. Which would be 28501 ÷ 1000 = 28*1000=28000, with 501 left over. So 28501 mod 1000 is 501.

Hence, the remainder when n is divided by 1000 is 501. Hmm. Wait, but I have to check all this again for errors. Let me verify.

First, let's recapitulate:

Total ordered pairs: 3^10 = 59049

Subtract cases where A is empty: 2^10 = 1024. Because each element can be in B or neither.

Subtract cases where B is empty: 2^10 = 1024. Each element in A or neither.

But we subtracted the case where both A and B are empty twice, so add back 1.

So 59049 - 1024 - 1024 +1 = 59049 - 2048 + 1 = 59049 - 2047 = Let me calculate 59049 - 2000 = 57049, then minus 47: 57049 - 47 = 57002. So that matches.

Ordered pairs:57002

Unordered pairs:57002 /2=28501. 28501/1000 is 28.501, so mod 1000 is 501.

Yes.

Wait, but just to make sure, let's take a simple example where the answer is known.

Take S={1,2}. Then the formula would give 3^2 -2*2^2 +1 =9 -8 +1=2 ordered pairs. Then since 2/2=1 unordered pair. Which is indeed correct: only { {1}, {2} } as the unordered pair.

Another example: S={1,2,3}. Let's compute with formula.

Total ordered pairs: 3^3 -2*2^3 +1 =27 -16 +1=12.

Unordered pairs:12 /2=6. Let's list them.

Possible unordered pairs {A,B} where A and B are non-empty disjoint subsets.

Possible subsets:

1. A={1}, B={2}

2. A={1}, B={3}

3. A={2}, B={3}

4. A={1}, B={2,3}

5. A={2}, B={1,3}

6. A={3}, B={1,2}

Total 6, which matches. So the formula works here. So seems correct.

Therefore, my confidence is growing.

Thus, the number is 28501 and mod 1000 is 501. Hence, the answer is 501.

But just to be absolutely sure, let me check the final calculation:

28,501 divided by 1000. 28*1000=28,000. 28,501 -28,000=501. Yep. So 501.

Therefore, the remainder is 501.

I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{501}
