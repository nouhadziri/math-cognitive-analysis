Problem:
Let $A$ be a $2n \times 2n$ matrix, with entries chosen independently at random. Every entry is chosen to be 0 or 1, each with probability $1/2$. Find the expected value of $\det(A-A^t)$ (as a function of $n$), where $A^t$ is the transpose of $A$.

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the expected value of the determinant of the matrix $B = A - A^t$, where $A$ is a $2n \times 2n$ random matrix with entries $0$ or $1$ with probability $1/2$.

The entries of $A$ are $a_{ij}$, where $1 \le i, j \le 2n$. The entries of $A^t$ are $a_{ji}$.
The entries of $B = A - A^t$ are $b_{ij} = a_{ij} - a_{ji}$.

Consider the properties of the entries $b_{ij}$.
$a_{ij}, a_{ji} \in \{0, 1\}$, with $P(a_{ij}=0) = P(a_{ij}=1) = 1/2$.
The pairs $(a_{ij}, a_{ji})$ can take values $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)$ each with probability $1/4$ (due to independence).

The possible values of $b_{ij} = a_{ij} - a_{ji}$:
- If $(a_{ij}, a_{ji}) = (0,0)$, $b_{ij} = 0 - 0 = 0$. Probability $1/4$.
- If $(a_{ij}, a_{ji}) = (0,1)$, $b_{ij} = 0 - 1 = -1$. Probability $1/4$.
- If $(a_{ij}, a_{ji}) = (1,0)$, $b_{ij} = 1 - 0 = 1$. Probability $1/4$.
- If $(a_{ij}, a_{ji}) = (1,1)$, $b_{ij} = 1 - 1 = 0$. Probability $1/4$.

So, the distribution of $b_{ij}$:
$P(b_{ij} = 0) = P((0,0)) + P((1,1)) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$.
$P(b_{ij} = 1) = P((1,0)) = 1/4$.
$P(b_{ij} = -1) = P((0,1)) = 1/4$.

The matrix $B = A - A^t$ is a skew-symmetric matrix, since $B^t = (A - A^t)^t = A^t - (A^t)^t = A^t - A = -(A - A^t) = -B$.
So, $b_{ji} = -b_{ij}$. This can also be seen from $b_{ji} = a_{ji} - a_{ij} = -(a_{ij} - a_{ji}) = -b_{ij}$.

The determinant of a skew-symmetric matrix of even size is the square of its Pfaffian.
We need to find $E[\det(B)]$.

Consider the case when $n=1$. $A$ is $2 \times 2$.
$A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$
$A^t = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21} \\ a_{12} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$
$B = A - A^t = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11}-a_{11} & a_{12}-a_{21} \\ a_{21}-a_{12} & a_{22}-a_{22} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & b_{12} \\ -b_{12} & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, where $b_{12} = a_{12} - a_{21}$.

$\det(B) = 0 \cdot 0 - b_{12} \cdot (-b_{12}) = b_{12}^2 = (a_{12} - a_{21})^2$.

The distribution of $a_{12} - a_{21}$:
Values: $0, 1, -1$.
$P(a_{12} - a_{21} = 0) = P((0,0) \text{ or } (1,1)) = 1/2$.
$P(a_{12} - a_{21} = 1) = P((1,0)) = 1/4$.
$P(a_{12} - a_{21} = -1) = P((0,1)) = 1/4$.

$E[(a_{12} - a_{21})^2] = (0)^2 \cdot P(0) + (1)^2 \cdot P(1) + (-1)^2 \cdot P(-1)$
$= 0 \cdot (1/2) + 1 \cdot (1/4) + 1 \cdot (1/4) = 0 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$.

So, for $n=1$, $E[\det(A-A^t)] = 1/2$.

Consider the case when $n=2$. $A$ is $4 \times 4$.
$B = A - A^t$ is a $4 \times 4$ skew-symmetric matrix.
$\det(B) = (Pf(B))^2$, where $Pf(B)$ is the Pfaffian of $B$.

The Pfaffian of a $4 \times 4$ skew-symmetric matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b_{12} & b_{13} & b_{14} \\ -b_{12} & 0 & b_{23} & b_{24} \\ -b_{13} & -b_{23} & 0 & b_{34} \\ -b_{14} & -b_{24} & -b_{34} & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is $b_{12}b_{34} - b_{13}b_{24} + b_{14}b_{23}$.

We need to find $E[(b_{12}b_{34} - b_{13}b_{24} + b_{14}b_{23})^2]$.
Expand the square:
$E[b_{12}^2 b_{34}^2 + b_{13}^2 b_{24}^2 + b_{14}^2 b_{23}^2 - 2 b_{12}b_{34}b_{13}b_{24} + 2 b_{12}b_{34}b_{14}b_{23} - 2 b_{13}b_{24}b_{14}b_{23}]$

The entries $b_{ij}$ are independent for $i < j$.
$E[b_{ij}] = 0 \cdot (1/2) + 1 \cdot (1/4) + (-1) \cdot (1/4) = 0$.
$E[b_{ij}^2] = 0^2 \cdot (1/2) + 1^2 \cdot (1/4) + (-1)^2 \cdot (1/4) = 0 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$.

Consider the terms in the expectation:
$E[b_{12}^2 b_{34}^2] = E[b_{12}^2] E[b_{34}^2] = (1/2) \cdot (1/2) = 1/4$.
Similarly, $E[b_{13}^2 b_{24}^2] = 1/4$, $E[b_{14}^2 b_{23}^2] = 1/4$.

Consider the cross terms, e.g., $E[b_{12}b_{34}b_{13}b_{24}]$.
The indices are $12, 34, 13, 24$. All are distinct pairs.
$E[b_{12}b_{34}b_{13}b_{24}] = E[b_{12}] E[b_{34}] E[b_{13}] E[b_{24}] = 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 = 0$.

Consider $E[b_{12}b_{34}b_{14}b_{23}]$. The pairs are $12, 34, 14, 23$.
All indices are distinct, so the terms are independent.
$E[b_{12}b_{34}b_{14}b_{23}] = E[b_{12}] E[b_{34}] E[b_{14}] E[b_{23}] = 0$.

So, $E[\det(B)] = E[(Pf(B))^2] = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 - 0 + 0 - 0 = 3/4$.

Let's verify the formula for Pfaffian squared.
$\det(B) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_{2n}} sgn(\sigma) \prod_{i=1}^{2n} b_{i, \sigma(i)}$
We need the expectation of this sum.

Consider the terms in the determinant expansion.
A term is $\prod_{i=1}^{2n} b_{i, \sigma(i)}$.
The expectation of this term is $E[\prod_{i=1}^{2n} b_{i, \sigma(i)}]$.

If $\sigma(i) = i$ for some $i$, then $b_{i, \sigma(i)} = b_{ii} = a_{ii} - a_{ii} = 0$.
The product is 0.

If the permutation $\sigma$ has a 1-cycle, the term is 0.

Consider permutations consisting of disjoint 2-cycles.
A term in the determinant corresponds to a permutation.
If the permutation is a product of transpositions $(i_1, j_1)(i_2, j_2)...(i_n, j_n)$ where all indices are distinct.
The term is $b_{i_1 j_1} b_{i_2 j_2} ... b_{i_n j_n}$ or $b_{j_1 i_1} b_{j_2 i_2} ... b_{j_n i_n}$.

Example $n=1$, $2n=2$. Permutations of $\{1, 2\}$ are $(1)(2)$ and $(1, 2)$.
$\det(B) = b_{11}b_{22} - b_{12}b_{21} = 0 \cdot 0 - b_{12}(-b_{12}) = b_{12}^2$.

Example $n=2$, $2n=4$. Permutations of $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$.
Terms involve products of 4 entries $b_{i, \sigma(i)}$.
Consider the permutation $(1, 2)(3, 4)$. Term: $b_{12} b_{21} b_{34} b_{43} = b_{12}(-b_{12}) b_{34}(-b_{34}) = b_{12}^2 b_{34}^2$.
Expectation $E[b_{12}^2 b_{34}^2] = E[b_{12}^2] E[b_{34}^2] = 1/2 \cdot 1/2 = 1/4$. Sign is $+1$.

Consider the permutation $(1, 3)(2, 4)$. Term: $b_{13} b_{31} b_{24} b_{42} = b_{13}(-b_{13}) b_{24}(-b_{24}) = b_{13}^2 b_{24}^2$.
Expectation $E[b_{13}^2 b_{24}^2] = 1/4$. Sign is $+1$.

Consider the permutation $(1, 4)(2, 3)$. Term: $b_{14} b_{41} b_{23} b_{32} = b_{14}(-b_{14}) b_{23}(-b_{23}) = b_{14}^2 b_{23}^2$.
Expectation $E[b_{14}^2 b_{23}^2] = 1/4$. Sign is $+1$.

Consider the permutation $(1, 2, 3, 4)$. Term: $b_{12} b_{23} b_{34} b_{41} = b_{12} b_{23} b_{34} (-b_{14})$.
Expectation $E[b_{12} b_{23} b_{34} (-b_{14})] = E[b_{12}] E[b_{23}] E[b_{34}] E[-b_{14}] = 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 = 0$.

In general, for a permutation $\sigma$, the term is $\prod_{i=1}^{2n} b_{i, \sigma(i)}$.
The expectation is non-zero only if the term can be written as a product of squares $b_{ij}^2$.
This happens when the permutation consists of disjoint transpositions.

Consider a perfect matching of the indices $\{1, 2, ..., 2n\}$.
A perfect matching corresponds to a product of $n$ disjoint transpositions.
Let $M = \{\{i_1, j_1\}, \{i_2, j_2\}, ..., \{i_n, j_n\}\}$ be a perfect matching, where $i_k < j_k$.
The permutation is $(i_1, j_1)(i_2, j_2)...(i_n, j_n)$.
The term in the determinant is $b_{i_1 j_1} b_{j_1 i_1} ... b_{i_n j_n} b_{j_n i_n} = (-1)^n b_{i_1 j_1}^2 ... b_{i_n j_n}^2$.
The sign of the permutation is $(-1)^n$.
The contribution to the determinant is $(-1)^n \prod_{k=1}^n b_{i_k j_k}^2$.
The expectation is $(-1)^n E[\prod_{k=1}^n b_{i_k j_k}^2] = (-1)^n \prod_{k=1}^n E[b_{i_k j_k}^2] = (-1)^n (1/2)^n$.

Consider a perfect matching. The number of perfect matchings of $2n$ elements is $(2n-1)!! = \frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}$.

Consider the term in the determinant expansion corresponding to a perfect matching.
Let the perfect matching be formed by pairs $(p_1, q_1), (p_2, q_2), ..., (p_n, q_n)$, where $p_k < q_k$.
The permutation is $(p_1 q_1)(p_2 q_2)...(p_n q_n)$. Sign is $(-1)^n$.
The term is $b_{p_1 q_1} b_{q_1 p_1} ... b_{p_n q_n} b_{q_n p_n} = (b_{p_1 q_1}(-b_{p_1 q_1})) ... (b_{p_n q_n}(-b_{p_n q_n}))$
$= (-1)^n b_{p_1 q_1}^2 ... b_{p_n q_n}^2$.
Expectation is $(-1)^n (1/2)^n$.

The determinant is the sum over all permutations.
Consider permutations that are products of disjoint transpositions.
These correspond to perfect matchings.

Number of perfect matchings of $2n$ elements:
Choose the partner for 1 in $2n-1$ ways.
Choose the partner for the smallest remaining element in $2n-3$ ways.
...
Number of perfect matchings = $(2n-1)(2n-3)...1 = (2n-1)!!$.

Each perfect matching contributes $(-1)^n (1/2)^n$ to the expected determinant.
Expected determinant = (number of perfect matchings) $\times (-1)^n (1/2)^n$
$= (2n-1)!! \times (-1)^n (1/2)^n$.

Let's check the cases $n=1, 2$.
$n=1$: $(2 \cdot 1 - 1)!! = 1!! = 1$. Expected det = $1 \times (-1)^1 (1/2)^1 = -1/2$.

Something is wrong with the sign.

Let's re-evaluate the determinant expansion for a skew-symmetric matrix.
$\det(B) = \sum_{\pi \in S_{2n}} sgn(\pi) \prod_{i=1}^{2n} b_{i, \pi(i)}$.

Consider a permutation $\pi$ that is a product of disjoint transpositions.
Let $\pi = (i_1 j_1) (i_2 j_2) ... (i_n j_n)$, where $i_k < j_k$.
The sign of $\pi$ is $(-1)^n$.
The term is $b_{i_1 j_1} b_{j_1 i_1} ... b_{i_n j_n} b_{j_n i_n} = (-1)^n b_{i_1 j_1}^2 ... b_{i_n j_n}^2$.
Expectation of the term is $(-1)^n (1/2)^n$.

The expected determinant is the sum of the expectations of the terms.
We need to sum over all permutations.

If a permutation has a cycle of length $> 2$, the expectation of the corresponding term is 0.
Example: $b_{12} b_{23} b_{31}$. $E[b_{12} b_{23} b_{31}] = E[b_{12}] E[b_{23}] E[b_{31}] = 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 = 0$.

The only permutations that contribute to the expected determinant are those consisting of disjoint transpositions.

Consider a perfect matching $M = \{\{i_1, j_1\}, ..., \{i_n, j_n\}\}$, $i_k < j_k$.
This corresponds to a term in the determinant expansion.
The permutation can be written as a product of transpositions in many ways.
The term is $\prod_{k=1}^n b_{i_k j_k} b_{j_k i_k} = \prod_{k=1}^n (-b_{i_k j_k}^2) = (-1)^n \prod_{k=1}^n b_{i_k j_k}^2$.

The number of perfect matchings is $(2n-1)!!$.
Each perfect matching contributes $(-1)^n (1/2)^n$ to the expected determinant.

Expected determinant = $\sum_{\text{perfect matchings } M} E[\text{term corresponding to } M]$

Consider a perfect matching $m = \{\{p_1, q_1\}, ..., \{p_n, q_n\}\}$, $p_i < q_i$.
The contribution to the determinant from this matching involves a permutation with sign $(-1)^n$.
The term is $(-1)^n b_{p_1 q_1}^2 ... b_{p_n q_n}^2$.
Expectation is $(-1)^n (1/2)^n$.

Summing over all $(2n-1)!!$ perfect matchings:
Expected determinant $= (2n-1)!! \times (-1)^n (1/2)^n$.

Let's check with $n=1$. Expected det $= 1 \times (-1)^1 (1/2)^1 = -1/2$.
Our direct calculation for $n=1$ gave $1/2$.

Where is the mistake?

The determinant of a skew-symmetric matrix is the square of the Pfaffian.
$E[\det(B)] = E[(Pf(B))^2]$.

Consider the definition of the Pfaffian.
$Pf(B) = \sum_{\pi \in \mathcal{M}_{2n}} sgn(\pi) \prod_{i=1}^n b_{\pi(2i-1), \pi(2i)}$,
where $\mathcal{M}_{2n}$ is the set of permutations $\pi$ of $\{1, ..., 2n\}$ such that
$\pi(1) < \pi(3) < ... < \pi(2n-1)$ and $\pi(2i-1) < \pi(2i)$ for $i=1, ..., n$.
These permutations correspond to perfect matchings.

Example $n=1$. $Pf(B) = b_{12}$.
$\det(B) = b_{12}^2$. $E[\det(B)] = E[b_{12}^2] = 1/2$.

Example $n=2$. $Pf(B) = b_{12}b_{34} - b_{13}b_{24} + b_{14}b_{23}$.
$E[(Pf(B))^2] = E[(b_{12}b_{34} - b_{13}b_{24} + b_{14}b_{23})^2] = 3/4$.

Consider the structure of the terms in the determinant.
Terms correspond to permutations. Only permutations that are products of disjoint transpositions contribute to the expectation.

Consider a perfect matching $M = \{\{i_1, j_1\}, ..., \{i_n, j_n\}\}$, $i_k < j_k$.
The term in the determinant corresponding to a permutation that realizes this matching is
$sgn(\sigma) b_{\sigma(1), \sigma(2)} b_{\sigma(3), \sigma(4)} ... b_{\sigma(2n-1), \sigma(2n)}$,
where the pairs $(\sigma(2k-1), \sigma(2k))$ are the pairs in the matching.

If we fix a perfect matching, there are $2^n n!$ permutations that correspond to it.
Example $n=1$, matching $\{\{1, 2\}\}$. Permutation $(1, 2)$. Term $b_{12}$. Sign $-1$.
Term in det: $-b_{12} b_{21} = -b_{12}(-b_{12}) = b_{12}^2$.

Example $n=2$, matching $\{\{1, 2\}, \{3, 4\}\}$.
Permutations: $(1, 2)(3, 4)$, sign $+1$, term $b_{12} b_{34}$.
Permutation $(3, 4)(1, 2)$, sign $+1$, term $b_{34} b_{12}$.
Permutation $(1, 2, 3, 4)$ and others do not contribute.

Consider the contribution of a perfect matching to the determinant.
Let the matching be given by pairs $(p_1, q_1), ..., (p_n, q_n)$, $p_i < q_i$.
Consider a permutation $\sigma$ such that the cycles are $(p_1 q_1), ..., (p_n q_n)$.
Sign of $\sigma$ is $(-1)^n$.
Term in determinant: $b_{p_1 q_1} b_{q_1 p_1} ... b_{p_n q_n} b_{q_n p_n} = (-1)^n b_{p_1 q_1}^2 ... b_{p_n q_n}^2$.

The expected value of the term is $(-1)^n (1/2)^n$.

Summing over all $(2n-1)!!$ perfect matchings:
Expected determinant $= \sum_{M} E[\text{term associated with } M]$.

Consider the determinant formula using permutations.
Each term corresponds to a permutation.
Expectation of a term is non-zero only if the permutation is a product of disjoint transpositions.
Consider a permutation that is a product of $n$ disjoint transpositions.
Let the transpositions be $(i_1, j_1), ..., (i_n, j_n)$.
The term is $sgn(\sigma) b_{i_1 j_1} b_{j_1 i_1} ... b_{i_n j_n} b_{j_n i_n}$.
Sign is $(-1)^n$. Term is $(-1)^n (-1)^n b_{i_1 j_1}^2 ... b_{i_n j_n}^2 = b_{i_1 j_1}^2 ... b_{i_n j_n}^2$.
Expectation is $(1/2)^n$.

Consider a perfect matching. The number of permutations that correspond to this matching is $2^n n!$.
The terms in the determinant corresponding to these permutations all have the same expectation $(1/2)^n$.

Consider a perfect matching $M$. The contribution to the determinant comes from permutations that realize this matching.
If the matching is $\{\{1, 2\}, \{3, 4\}, ...\}$, the permutations involve pairing the elements.

The expected value is the sum of expectations of terms in the determinant.
Terms with non-zero expectation come from permutations that are products of disjoint transpositions.
Consider a set of $n$ disjoint pairs from $\{1, ..., 2n\}$.
Number of ways to form such pairs is $(2n-1)!!$.
For each set of pairs, say $\{(i_1, j_1), ..., (i_n, j_n)\}$, the expectation of the corresponding term is $(1/2)^n$.

Expected determinant = (number of ways to form $n$ disjoint pairs) $\times (1/2)^n$
$= (2n-1)!! \times (1/2)^n$.
$(2n-1)!! = \frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}$.
Expected determinant = $\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!} \times \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{(2n)!}{4^n n!}$.

Check with $n=1$. Expected det = $2! / (4^1 \cdot 1!) = 2 / 4 = 1/2$. Matches.
Check with $n=2$. Expected det = $4! / (4^2 \cdot 2!) = 24 / (16 \cdot 2) = 24 / 32 = 3/4$. Matches.

<text>Consider the case when $n=1$. $A$ is $2 \times 2$.
$A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$
$A^t = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21} \\ a_{12} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$
$B = A - A^t = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11}-a_{11} & a_{12}-a_{21} \\ a_{21}-a_{12} & a_{22}-a_{22} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & b_{12} \\ -b_{12} & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, where $b_{12} = a_{12} - a_{21}$.

$\det(B) = 0 \cdot 0 - b_{12} \cdot (-b_{12}) = b_{12}^2 = (a_{12} - a_{21})^2$.

The distribution of $a_{12} - a_{21}$:
Values: $0, 1, -1$.
$P(a_{12} - a_{21} = 0) = P((0,0) \text{ or } (1,1)) = 1/2$.
$P(a_{12} - a_{21} = 1) = P((1,0)) = 1/4$.
$P(a_{12} - a_{21} = -1) = P((0,1)) = 1/4$.

$E[(a_{12} - a_{21})^2] = (0)^2 \cdot P(0) + (1)^2 \cdot P(1) + (-1)^2 \cdot P(-1)$
$= 0 \cdot (1/2) + 1 \cdot (1/4) + 1 \cdot (1/4) = 0 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$.

So, for $n=1$, $E[\det(A-A^t)] = 1/2$.</text>
<explanation>The solver examines the simplest case (n=1) in detail, working through the calculation step by step to gain insight into the general pattern. This concrete example serves as a foundation for understanding the general case.</explanation>

<start>2325</start>
<end>3155</end>
<text>Consider the case when $n=2$. $A$ is $4 \times 4$.
$B = A - A^t$ is a $4 \times 4$ skew-symmetric matrix.
$\det(B) = (Pf(B))^2$, where $Pf(B)$ is the Pfaffian of $B$.

The Pfaffian of a $4 \times 4$ skew-symmetric matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & b_{12} & b_{13} & b_{14} \\ -b_{12} & 0 & b_{23} & b_{24} \\ -b_{13} & -b_{23} & 0 & b_{34} \\ -b_{14} & -b_{24} & -b_{34} & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is $b_{12}b_{34} - b_{13}b_{24} + b_{14}b_{23}$.

We need to find $E[(b_{12}b_{34} - b_{13}b_{24} + b_{14}b_{23})^2]$.
Expand the square:
$E[b_{12}^2 b_{34}^2 + b_{13}^2 b_{24}^2 + b_{14}^2 b_{23}^2 - 2 b_{12}b_{34}b_{13}b_{24} + 2 b_{12}b_{34}b_{14}b_{23} - 2 b_{13}b_{24}b_{14}b_{23}]$</text>

<text>Let's check the cases $n=1, 2$.
$n=1$: $(2 \cdot 1 - 1)!! = 1!! = 1$. Expected det = $1 \times (-1)^1 (1/2)^1 = -1/2$.

Something is wrong with the sign.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies a discrepancy between their current approach and the earlier calculation for n=1. This demonstrates critical self-monitoring and the ability to recognize when something doesn't align with previous results.</explanation>

<text>Where is the mistake?

The determinant of a skew-symmetric matrix is the square of the Pfaffian.
$E[\det(B)] = E[(Pf(B))^2]$.</text>
<explanation>After detecting an inconsistency, the solver explicitly questions their approach and returns to fundamental principles about skew-symmetric matrices to identify where the error might be.</explanation>

<text>Check with $n=1$. Expected det = $2! / (4^1 \cdot 1!) = 2 / 4 = 1/2$. Matches.
Check with $n=2$. Expected det = $4! / (4^2 \cdot 2!) = 24 / (16 \cdot 2) = 24 / 32 = 3/4$. Matches.</text>

$P(b_{ij} = 1) = P((1,0)) = 1/4$.
$P(b_{ij} = -1) = P((0,1)) = 1/4$.</text>

<text>The entries $b_{ij}$ are independent for $i < j$.
$E[b_{ij}] = 0 \cdot (1/2) + 1 \cdot (1/4) + (-1) \cdot (1/4) = 0$.
$E[b_{ij}^2] = 0^2 \cdot (1/2) + 1^2 \cdot (1/4) + (-1)^2 \cdot (1/4) = 0 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$.</text>

The sign of the permutation is $(-1)^n$.
The contribution to the determinant is $(-1)^n \prod_{k=1}^n b_{i_k j_k}^2$.
The expectation is $(-1)^n E[\prod_{k=1}^n b_{i_k j_k}^2] = (-1)^n \prod_{k=1}^n E[b_{i_k j_k}^2] = (-1)^n (1/2)^n$.</text>
