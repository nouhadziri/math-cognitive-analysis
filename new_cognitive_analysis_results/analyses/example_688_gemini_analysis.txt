Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the Lebesgue measure of the union of line segments connecting points on the x-axis to points on the line y=1, where the x-coordinate of the lower point and the x-coordinate of the upper point are related by a continuous function $f(t)$. We also need to find the minimum of this measure over all such continuous functions $f$.

Let the segment $\overline{A_tB_t}$ connect the point $A_t = (t, 0)$ to the point $B_t = (f(t), 1)$.
The line segment $\overline{A_tB_t}$ can be parameterized as:
\[ P(s) = (1-s)A_t + sB_t = (1-s)(t, 0) + s(f(t), 1) = ((1-s)t + sf(t), s) \]
where $0 \leq s \leq 1$.

The union of all these segments is the set $S = \bigcup_{t \in [0,1]} \overline{A_tB_t}$.
A point $(x, y)$ belongs to $S$ if and only if there exists a $t \in [0,1]$ and an $s \in [0,1]$ such that:
\[ x = (1-s)t + sf(t) \]
\[ y = s \]

Since $0 \leq y = s \leq 1$, we have $y \in [0, 1]$.
Given a point $(x, y)$ with $y \in [0, 1]$, we need to find if there exists a $t \in [0, 1]$ such that:
\[ x = (1-y)t + yf(t) \]
\[ x - yt = t - yt + yf(t) \]
\[ x - yt = t(1-y) + yf(t) \]

Let $g(t, y) = (1-y)t + yf(t)$. We are looking for conditions such that $x = g(t, y)$ for some $t \in [0, 1]$.

Consider a fixed $y \in [0, 1]$. The cross-section of the set $S$ at height $y$ is the set of $x$ values such that $(x, y) \in S$. This occurs if $x = (1-y)t + yf(t)$ for some $t \in [0, 1]$.

Let $h_y(t) = (1-y)t + yf(t)$. Since $f(t)$ is continuous on $[0, 1]$, $h_y(t)$ is also continuous on $[0, 1]$.
As $t$ ranges from $0$ to $1$, $h_y(t)$ ranges from $h_y(0) = yf(0)$ to $h_y(1) = (1-y) + yf(1)$.
By the Intermediate Value Theorem, the range of $h_y(t)$ is the interval $[\min(yf(0), (1-y)+yf(1)), \max(yf(0), (1-y)+yf(1))]$.

The cross-section of $S$ at height $y$ is the interval $[\min(yf(0), 1-y+yf(1)), \max(yf(0), 1-y+yf(1))]$.
The length of this interval is $|(1-y) + y(f(1) - f(0))|$.

The Lebesgue measure of $S$ can be found using Fubini's theorem:
\[ m(S) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} m(\{x: (x, y) \in S\}) dy \]
Since the set is contained between $y=0$ and $y=1$, the integral becomes:
\[ m(S) = \int_{0}^{1} m(\{x: (x, y) \in S\}) dy \]
The set $\{x: (x, y) \in S\}$ is the interval $[\min(yf(0), 1-y+yf(1)), \max(yf(0), 1-y+yf(1))]$, and its measure is the length of the interval, which is $|1-y + y(f(1) - f(0))|$.

So, the measure of $S$ is:
\[ m(S) = \int_{0}^{1} |1-y + y(f(1) - f(0))| dy \]

Let $c = f(1) - f(0)$. Then the integrand is $|1 + y(c-1)|$.
Case 1: $c = 1$. The integrand is $|1| = 1$. $m(S) = \int_{0}^{1} 1 dy = 1$.
Case 2: $c > 1$. Then $c-1 > 0$. $1 + y(c-1) > 0$ for $y \in [0, 1]$.
$m(S) = \int_{0}^{1} (1 + y(c-1)) dy = [y + \frac{y^2}{2}(c-1)]_{0}^{1} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(c-1) = 1 + \frac{f(1) - f(0) - 1}{2} = \frac{1 + f(1) - f(0)}{2}$.
Case 3: $c < 1$. Then $c-1 < 0$.
We need to find when $1 + y(c-1) = 0$, i.e., $y = \frac{-1}{c-1} = \frac{1}{1-c}$.
Since $c < 1$, $1-c > 0$.
If $c \leq 0$, then $1-c \geq 1$, so $\frac{1}{1-c} \leq 1$.
If $0 < c < 1$, then $0 < 1-c < 1$, so $\frac{1}{1-c} > 1$.

Subcase 3.1: $c \leq 0$. Then $0 \leq \frac{1}{1-c} \leq 1$.
$m(S) = \int_{0}^{\frac{1}{1-c}} (1 + y(c-1)) dy + \int_{\frac{1}{1-c}}^{1} -(1 + y(c-1)) dy$
$\int (1 + y(c-1)) dy = y + \frac{y^2}{2}(c-1)$
$[y + \frac{y^2}{2}(c-1)]_{0}^{\frac{1}{1-c}} = \frac{1}{1-c} + \frac{1}{2(1-c)^2}(c-1) = \frac{1}{1-c} - \frac{1}{2(1-c)} = \frac{1}{2(1-c)}$
$[-y - \frac{y^2}{2}(c-1)]_{\frac{1}{1-c}}^{1} = (-1 - \frac{1}{2}(c-1)) - (-\frac{1}{1-c} - \frac{1}{2(1-c)^2}(c-1))$
$= -1 - \frac{c-1}{2} + \frac{1}{1-c} - \frac{c-1}{2(1-c)^2}$
$= -1 - \frac{c-1}{2} + \frac{1}{1-c} + \frac{1}{2(1-c)}$
$= -1 - \frac{c-1}{2} + \frac{3}{2(1-c)}$
$m(S) = \frac{1}{2(1-c)} - 1 - \frac{c-1}{2} + \frac{3}{2(1-c)} = \frac{4}{2(1-c)} - 1 - \frac{c-1}{2} = \frac{2}{1-c} - 1 - \frac{c-1}{2}$
$= \frac{4 - 2(1-c) - (1-c)(c-1)}{2(1-c)} = \frac{4 - 2 + 2c + (1-c)^2}{2(1-c)} = \frac{2 + 2c + 1 - 2c + c^2}{2(1-c)} = \frac{3 + c^2}{2(1-c)}$

Subcase 3.2: $0 < c < 1$. Then $\frac{1}{1-c} > 1$. The integrand $1 + y(c-1)$ is always positive on $[0, 1]$.
$m(S) = \int_{0}^{1} (1 + y(c-1)) dy = 1 + \frac{c-1}{2} = \frac{1 + c}{2} = \frac{1 + f(1) - f(0)}{2}$.

Combining the cases:
If $f(1) - f(0) \geq 1$, $m(S) = \frac{1 + f(1) - f(0)}{2}$.
If $0 \leq f(1) - f(0) < 1$, $m(S) = \frac{1 + f(1) - f(0)}{2}$.
If $f(1) - f(0) < 0$, $m(S) = \frac{3 + (f(1) - f(0))^2}{2(1 - (f(1) - f(0)))}$.

Let $d = f(1) - f(0)$.
If $d \geq 0$, $m(S) = \frac{1+d}{2}$.
If $d < 0$, $m(S) = \frac{3+d^2}{2(1-d)}$.

We need to find the minimum of $m(S)$ over all continuous functions $f$. This means finding the minimum over all possible values of $d = f(1) - f(0)$.

Since $f$ is continuous on $[0, 1]$, by the Extreme Value Theorem, $f$ attains its minimum and maximum values. Let $m = \min_{t \in [0, 1]} f(t)$ and $M = \max_{t \in [0, 1]} f(t)$.
The range of $f$ is $[m, M]$.
The value of $d = f(1) - f(0)$ can range from $m - M$ to $M - m$.

Consider the function $g(d)$:
$g(d) = \frac{1+d}{2}$ for $d \geq 0$.
$g(d) = \frac{3+d^2}{2(1-d)}$ for $d < 0$.

For $d \geq 0$, the minimum of $\frac{1+d}{2}$ occurs at $d=0$, with value $\frac{1}{2}$.
For $d < 0$, we need to find the minimum of $\frac{3+d^2}{2(1-d)}$.
Let $h(d) = \frac{3+d^2}{2(1-d)}$.
$h'(d) = \frac{2d \cdot 2(1-d) - (3+d^2) \cdot 2(-1)}{(2(1-d))^2} = \frac{4d(1-d) + 2(3+d^2)}{4(1-d)^2}$
$= \frac{4d - 4d^2 + 6 + 2d^2}{4(1-d)^2} = \frac{-2d^2 + 4d + 6}{4(1-d)^2} = \frac{-d^2 + 2d + 3}{2(1-d)^2}$
Set $h'(d) = 0$, so $-d^2 + 2d + 3 = 0$, or $d^2 - 2d - 3 = 0$.
$(d-3)(d+1) = 0$. The roots are $d = 3$ and $d = -1$.
Since we are considering $d < 0$, the critical point is $d = -1$.

We need to check the sign of $h'(d)$ for $d < 0$. The denominator is always positive.
The numerator is $-d^2 + 2d + 3$.
If $d < -1$, e.g., $d = -2$, numerator is $-4 - 4 + 3 = -5 < 0$. $h'(d) < 0$.
If $-1 < d < 0$, e.g., $d = -0.5$, numerator is $-0.25 - 1 + 3 = 1.75 > 0$. $h'(d) > 0$.
So $h(d)$ decreases for $d < -1$ and increases for $-1 < d < 0$.
The minimum occurs at $d = -1$.

The minimum value of $h(d)$ is $h(-1) = \frac{3+(-1)^2}{2(1-(-1))} = \frac{3+1}{2(2)} = \frac{4}{4} = 1$.

Now, we need to consider the range of $d = f(1) - f(0)$.
The possible values of $d$ are in the interval $[m - M, M - m]$.
Since $m \leq f(0) \leq M$ and $m \leq f(1) \leq M$,
$m - M \leq f(1) - f(0) \leq M - m$.
So, $m - M \leq d \leq M - m$.
Note that $m - M \leq 0$.

If the minimum of $g(d)$ occurs in the allowed range of $d$, then that is the minimum measure.

The minimum of $\frac{1+d}{2}$ for $d \geq 0$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ at $d=0$.
The minimum of $\frac{3+d^2}{2(1-d)}$ for $d < 0$ is $1$ at $d=-1$.

Consider the case when the range of $d$ includes $0$. This happens if $m \leq f(0), f(1) \leq M$, which is always true.
If $0$ is in the range of $d$, then we can choose a function such that $f(1) - f(0) = 0$.
Example: $f(t) = c$, a constant function. Then $d = c - c = 0$.
For such a function, $m(S) = \frac{1+0}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$.

If the range of $d$ includes $-1$, then we can choose a function such that $f(1) - f(0) = -1$.
Example: $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 0$. We can find a continuous function with these values, e.g., $f(t) = 1 - t$.
For such a function, $m(S) = 1$.

Let's reconsider the geometry.
The set $S$ is the region bounded by the lines connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(f(0), 1)$ and $(1, 0)$ to $(f(1), 1)$.

The boundary curves are given by the lines passing through $(t, 0)$ and $(f(t), 1)$.
The line equation is $y = \frac{1-0}{f(t)-t} (x-t)$, if $f(t) \neq t$.
$(f(t)-t)y = x-t$, so $x = t + y(f(t)-t)$.

Let's verify the measurability of the set $S$.
The map $\Phi: [0, 1] \times [0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $\Phi(t, s) = ((1-s)t + sf(t), s)$ has continuous components, so it is continuous.
The domain $[0, 1] \times [0, 1]$ is compact. The image of a compact set under a continuous map is compact, hence closed and bounded, and thus Lebesgue-measurable.
$S = \Phi([0, 1] \times [0, 1])$. So $S$ is Lebesgue-measurable.

Minimum of the measure.
We found that the measure is $\int_{0}^{1} |1 + y(f(1) - f(0) - 1)| dy$.
Let $c = f(1) - f(0)$. The integral is $\int_{0}^{1} |1 + y(c-1)| dy$.

If $c = 1$, measure is 1.
If $c > 1$, measure is $\frac{1+c}{2}$. Minimum is when $c$ is minimum, i.e., $c > 1$.
If $c < 1$, measure depends on the sign change of $1 + y(c-1)$.

Let's consider specific continuous functions $f$.
If $f(t) = t$, then $c = 1 - 0 = 1$. Measure is 1. The region is the triangle with vertices $(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)$.
If $f(t) = 0$, then $c = 0 - 0 = 0$. Measure is $\int_{0}^{1} |1 - y| dy = \int_{0}^{1} (1 - y) dy = [y - \frac{y^2}{2}]_{0}^{1} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$. The region is the triangle with vertices $(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1)$.
If $f(t) = 1$, then $c = 1 - 1 = 0$. Measure is $\frac{1}{2}$. The region is the triangle with vertices $(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)$.

If $f(t) = 1 - t$, then $c = 0 - 1 = -1$.
Measure is $\int_{0}^{1} |1 - 2y| dy = \int_{0}^{1/2} (1 - 2y) dy + \int_{1/2}^{1} (2y - 1) dy$
$= [y - y^2]_{0}^{1/2} + [y^2 - y]_{1/2}^{1} = (\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4}) + ((1 - 1) - (\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2}))$
$= \frac{1}{4} + (0 - (-\frac{1}{4})) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$.

It seems my calculation of the measure was slightly off. Let's recheck.

The region $S$ can be described as the set of points $(x, y)$ such that $0 \leq y \leq 1$ and $\min(yf(0), (1-y)+yf(1)) \leq x \leq \max(yf(0), (1-y)+yf(1))$.

The measure is $\int_{0}^{1} |\underbrace{(1-y) + yf(1)}_{x_{right}} - \underbrace{yf(0)}_{x_{left}}| dy = \int_{0}^{1} |1 - y + y(f(1) - f(0))| dy$.
Assuming $yf(0) < (1-y)+yf(1)$, then $y(f(0) - f(1)) < 1-y$.

Consider the geometry again. The region is swept by the line segment from $(t, 0)$ to $(f(t), 1)$.

If $f(t) = t$, segments connect $(t, 0)$ to $(t, 1)$. Union is the rectangle $[0, 1] \times [0, 1]$, measure 1.
$f(1) - f(0) = 1 - 0 = 1$. Integral is $\int_{0}^{1} |1 - y + y(1)| dy = \int_{0}^{1} 1 dy = 1$.

If $f(t) = 0$, segments connect $(t, 0)$ to $(0, 1)$. The region is the triangle with vertices $(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0)$.
$f(1) - f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0$. Integral is $\int_{0}^{1} |1 - y| dy = \frac{1}{2}$.

If $f(t) = 1$, segments connect $(t, 0)$ to $(1, 1)$. The region is the triangle with vertices $(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)$.
$f(1) - f(0) = 1 - 1 = 0$. Integral is $\int_{0}^{1} |1 - y| dy = \frac{1}{2}$.

If $f(t) = 1 - t$, segments connect $(t, 0)$ to $(1-t, 1)$.
$f(1) - f(0) = 0 - 1 = -1$. Integral is $\int_{0}^{1} |1 - y + y(-1)| dy = \int_{0}^{1} |1 - 2y| dy = \frac{1}{2}$.

The minimum value of the measure is related to the minimum of $\int_{0}^{1} |1 + y(f(1) - f(0) - 1)| dy$.
Let $d = f(1) - f(0)$. We need to minimize $\int_{0}^{1} |1 + y(d-1)| dy$.

If $d = 1$, integral is 1.
If $d > 1$, integral is $\int_{0}^{1} (1 + y(d-1)) dy = 1 + \frac{d-1}{2} = \frac{1+d}{2}$. Minimum is when $d$ is minimum $> 1$.
If $d < 1$, let $k = 1 - d > 0$. Integral is $\int_{0}^{1} |1 - ky| dy$.
If $1 - k \geq 0$, i.e., $k \leq 1$, $d \geq 0$. $\int_{0}^{1} (1 - ky) dy = [y - \frac{ky^2}{2}]_{0}^{1} = 1 - \frac{k}{2} = 1 - \frac{1-d}{2} = \frac{2 - 1 + d}{2} = \frac{1+d}{2}$.
If $1 - k < 0$, i.e., $k > 1$, $d < 0$.
$\int_{0}^{1/k} (1 - ky) dy + \int_{1/k}^{1} (ky - 1) dy = [y - \frac{ky^2}{2}]_{0}^{1/k} + [\frac{ky^2}{2} - y]_{1/k}^{1}$
$= (\frac{1}{k} - \frac{k}{2k^2}) + (\frac{k}{2} - 1 - (\frac{k}{2k^2} - \frac{1}{k})) = (\frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{2k}) + (\frac{k}{2} - 1 - \frac{1}{2k} + \frac{1}{k})$
$= \frac{1}{2k} + \frac{k}{2} - 1 - \frac{1}{2k} + \frac{1}{k} = \frac{k}{2} - 1 + \frac{1}{k} = \frac{k^2 - 2k + 2}{2k} = \frac{(1-d)^2 - 2(1-d) + 2}{2(1-d)}$
$= \frac{1 - 2d + d^2 - 2 + 2d + 2}{2(1-d)} = \frac{1+d^2}{2(1-d)}$.

So, measure is $\frac{1+d}{2}$ if $d \geq 0$, and $\frac{1+d^2}{2(1-d)}$ if $d < 0$.
Minimum of $\frac{1+d}{2}$ for $d \geq 0$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ at $d=0$.
Minimum of $\frac{1+d^2}{2(1-d)}$ for $d < 0$. Derivative is $\frac{2d \cdot 2(1-d) - (1+d^2) \cdot 2(-1)}{4(1-d)^2} = \frac{4d - 4d^2 + 2 + 2d^2}{4(1-d)^2} = \frac{-2d^2 + 4d + 2}{4(1-d)^2}$.
Set $-2d^2 + 4d + 2 = 0$, $d^2 - 2d - 1 = 0$. $d = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4(-1)}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{2}$.
Since $d < 0$, we have $d = 1 - \sqrt{2}$.
Value at $d = 1 - \sqrt{2}$: $\frac{1 + (1 - \sqrt{2})^2}{2(1 - (1 - \sqrt{2}))} = \frac{1 + 1 - 2\sqrt{2} + 2}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{4 - 2\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} - 1$.
$\sqrt{2} - 1 \approx 1.414 - 1 = 0.414$.

Minimum of the measure is $\frac{1}{2}$. This is achieved when $f(1) - f(0) = 0$, e.g., $f(t) = constant$.

<text>Case 3: $c < 1$. Then $c-1 < 0$.
We need to find when $1 + y(c-1) = 0$, i.e., $y = \frac{-1}{c-1} = \frac{1}{1-c}$.
Since $c < 1$, $1-c > 0$.
If $c \leq 0$, then $1-c \geq 1$, so $\frac{1}{1-c} \leq 1$.
If $0 < c < 1$, then $0 < 1-c < 1$, so $\frac{1}{1-c} > 1$.

<explanation>The solver further subdivides Case 3 into subcases based on the sign of c, showing nested case analysis. For each subcase, they develop specific integration approaches and perform detailed calculations to find the measure. This demonstrates systematic problem decomposition based on parameter conditions.</explanation>

<skill>Calculus Techniques</skill>
<definition>The ability to apply calculus methods such as integration, differentiation, and optimization to solve mathematical problems.</definition>

<start>1467</start>
<end>1900</end>
<text>Since the set is contained between $y=0$ and $y=1$, the integral becomes:
\[ m(S) = \int_{0}^{1} m(\{x: (x, y) \in S\}) dy \]
The set $\{x: (x, y) \in S\}$ is the interval $[\min(yf(0), 1-y+yf(1)), \max(yf(0), 1-y+yf(1))]$, and its measure is the length of the interval, which is $|1-y + y(f(1) - f(0))|$.

So, the measure of $S$ is:
\[ m(S) = \int_{0}^{1} |1-y + y(f(1) - f(0))| dy \]</text>
<explanation>The solver applies integration techniques to calculate the Lebesgue measure, using knowledge of measure theory and Fubini's theorem to convert a geometric problem into a definite integral. They correctly identify the integration bounds and integrand based on the cross-section analysis.</explanation>

<start>5276</start>
<end>5681</end>
<text>If $d < 1$, let $k = 1 - d > 0$. Integral is $\int_{0}^{1} |1 - ky| dy$.
If $1 - k \geq 0$, i.e., $k \leq 1$, $d \geq 0$. $\int_{0}^{1} (1 - ky) dy = [y - \frac{ky^2}{2}]_{0}^{1} = 1 - \frac{k}{2} = 1 - \frac{1-d}{2} = \frac{2 - 1 + d}{2} = \frac{1+d}{2}$.
If $1 - k < 0$, i.e., $k > 1$, $d < 0$.
$\int_{0}^{1/k} (1 - ky) dy + \int_{1/k}^{1} (ky - 1) dy = [y - \frac{ky^2}{2}]_{0}^{1/k} + [\frac{ky^2}{2} - y]_{1/k}^{1}$</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates advanced integration techniques by handling absolute value functions in the integrand. They correctly split the integration domain when the integrand changes sign and apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate the resulting integrals.</explanation>

<skill>Optimization</skill>
<definition>The ability to find maximum or minimum values of functions, often using techniques from calculus such as finding critical points and analyzing derivatives.</definition>

<start>3810</start>
<end>4326</end>
<text>For $d \geq 0$, the minimum of $\frac{1+d}{2}$ occurs at $d=0$, with value $\frac{1}{2}$.
For $d < 0$, we need to find the minimum of $\frac{3+d^2}{2(1-d)}$.
Let $h(d) = \frac{3+d^2}{2(1-d)}$.
$h'(d) = \frac{2d \cdot 2(1-d) - (3+d^2) \cdot 2(-1)}{(2(1-d))^2} = \frac{4d(1-d) + 2(3+d^2)}{4(1-d)^2}$
$= \frac{4d - 4d^2 + 6 + 2d^2}{4(1-d)^2} = \frac{-2d^2 + 4d + 6}{4(1-d)^2} = \frac{-d^2 + 2d + 3}{2(1-d)^2}$
Set $h'(d) = 0$, so $-d^2 + 2d + 3 = 0$, or $d^2 - 2d - 3 = 0$.
$(d-3)(d+1) = 0$. The roots are $d = 3$ and $d = -1$.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies optimization techniques to find the minimum value of the measure. They compute the derivative of the function, set it equal to zero to find critical points, and then analyze these points to determine which gives the minimum value. This shows a systematic approach to optimization problems.</explanation>

<start>6036</start>
<end>6510</end>
<text>Minimum of $\frac{1+d}{2}$ for $d \geq 0$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ at $d=0$.
Minimum of $\frac{1+d^2}{2(1-d)}$ for $d < 0$. Derivative is $\frac{2d \cdot 2(1-d) - (1+d^2) \cdot 2(-1)}{4(1-d)^2} = \frac{4d - 4d^2 + 2 + 2d^2}{4(1-d)^2} = \frac{-2d^2 + 4d + 2}{4(1-d)^2}$.
Set $-2d^2 + 4d + 2 = 0$, $d^2 - 2d - 1 = 0$. $d = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4(-1)}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{2}$.
Since $d < 0$, we have $d = 1 - \sqrt{2}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver again demonstrates optimization skills by finding critical points of a different function. They take the derivative, set it to zero, and solve the resulting quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. They correctly identify which critical point is relevant to the domain of interest (d < 0).</explanation>

<text>Let's consider specific continuous functions $f$.
If $f(t) = t$, then $c = 1 - 0 = 1$. Measure is 1. The region is the triangle with vertices $(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)$.
If $f(t) = 0$, then $c = 0 - 0 = 0$. Measure is $\int_{0}^{1} |1 - y| dy = \int_{0}^{1} (1 - y) dy = [y - \frac{y^2}{2}]_{0}^{1} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$. The region is the triangle with vertices $(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1)$.
If $f(t) = 1$, then $c = 1 - 1 = 0$. Measure is $\frac{1}{2}$. The region is the triangle with vertices $(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)$.

If $f(t) = 1 - t$, then $c = 0 - 1 = -1$.</text>
<explanation>The solver tests specific examples of continuous functions to verify their general formulas and gain insight into the problem. They choose simple functions (constant, identity, etc.) and calculate the resulting measure for each, which helps confirm their derivations and understand the geometric interpretation.</explanation>

<skill>Error Detection and Correction</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify mistakes or inconsistencies in one's work and make appropriate corrections.</definition>

<start>4328</start>
<end>4440</end>
<text>We need to check the sign of $h'(d)$ for $d < 0$. The denominator is always positive.
The numerator is $-d^2 + 2d + 3$.</text>
<explanation>The solver checks the sign of the derivative to confirm whether the critical point is indeed a minimum, showing careful verification of their optimization work.</explanation>
