Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the number of distinct values of $z=|x-y|$, where $x$ and $y$ are three-digit integers between $100$ and $999$, inclusive, and $y$ is the number formed by reversing the digits of $x$.

Let the three digits of $x$ be $a, b, c$, where $a \in \{1, 2, ..., 9\}$ and $b, c \in \{0, 1, ..., 9\}$.
Then $x = 100a + 10b + c$.
The number formed by reversing the digits of $x$ is $y = 100c + 10b + a$.

We are given that $100 \le x \le 999$, which is consistent with the representation of $x$ using three digits.
The range of $x$ implies $1 \le a \le 9$, $0 \le b \le 9$, $0 \le c \le 9$.

The value of $z$ is $|x-y| = |(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a)|$.
$z = |100a + 10b + c - 100c - 10b - a|$
$z = |99a - 99c|$
$z = |99(a - c)|$
$z = 99 |a - c|$

We need to find the number of distinct values of $z$. This depends on the possible values of $|a - c|$.

The digits $a$ and $c$ are from the digits of $x$.
$a$ is the hundreds digit of $x$, so $1 \le a \le 9$.
$c$ is the units digit of $x$, so $0 \le c \le 9$.

The possible values of $a - c$:
Smallest value: $a=1, c=9 \implies a-c = 1 - 9 = -8$.
Largest value: $a=9, c=0 \implies a-c = 9 - 0 = 9$.

The range of $a - c$ is $[-8, 9]$.
The possible integer values of $a - c$ are $-8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.

The possible values of $|a - c|$ are $|-8|, |-7|, ..., |-1|, |0|, |1|, ..., |9|$, which are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.
The possible values of $|a - c|$ are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.

Now, we need to check if all these values of $|a - c|$ can be achieved given the constraints on $a$ and $c$.

Case 1: $|a - c| = 0 \implies a = c$.
Possible pairs $(a, c)$: $(1, 1), (2, 2), ..., (9, 9)$. These are possible since $1 \le a \le 9$ and $0 \le c \le 9$.

Case 2: $|a - c| = 1 \implies a - c = 1$ or $a - c = -1$.
If $a - c = 1$, pairs $(a, c)$: $(1, 0), (2, 1), ..., (9, 8)$.
If $a - c = -1$, pairs $(a, c)$: $(1, 2), (2, 3), ..., (8, 9)$.

Case 3: $|a - c| = 2 \implies a - c = 2$ or $a - c = -2$.
If $a - c = 2$, pairs $(a, c)$: $(2, 0), (3, 1), ..., (9, 7)$.
If $a - c = -2$, pairs $(a, c)$: $(1, 3), (2, 4), ..., (7, 9)$.

...

Case 9: $|a - c| = 8 \implies a - c = 8$ or $a - c = -8$.
If $a - c = 8$, pair $(a, c)$: $(8, 0), (9, 1)$.
If $a - c = -8$, pair $(a, c)$: $(1, 9)$.

Case 10: $|a - c| = 9 \implies a - c = 9$ or $a - c = -9$.
If $a - c = 9$, pair $(a, c)$: $(9, 0)$.
If $a - c = -9$, not possible since $a \ge 1$.

The possible values of $|a - c|$ are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.
There are $10$ possible values for $|a - c|$.

Now, the possible values of $z = 99 |a - c|$.
When $|a - c| = 0$, $z = 99 \times 0 = 0$.
When $|a - c| = 1$, $z = 99 \times 1 = 99$.
When $|a - c| = 2$, $z = 99 \times 2 = 198$.
...
When $|a - c| = 9$, $z = 99 \times 9 = 891$.

The distinct values of $z$ are $99 \times k$, where $k \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
The distinct values of $z$ are $0, 99, 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792, 891$.

There are $10$ distinct values of $z$.

Let's double-check the constraints.
$x, y$ are between $100$ and $999$, inclusive.
$x = 100a + 10b + c$
$y = 100c + 10b + a$

If $z = 0$, then $|a - c| = 0$, so $a = c$.
Example: $x = 121, y = 121, z = 0$.

If $z = 99$, then $|a - c| = 1$.
Example: $a = 2, c = 1, b = 0 \implies x = 201, y = 102, z = |201 - 102| = 99$.
Example: $a = 1, c = 2, b = 0 \implies x = 102, y = 201, z = |102 - 201| = 99$.

If $z = 891$, then $|a - c| = 9$.
Example: $a = 9, c = 0, b = 0 \implies x = 900, y = 009 = 9$. This is not allowed since $y$ must be between $100$ and $999$.

The reversal of the digits of $x$ must also be a number between $100$ and $999$.
$100 \le y \le 999$
$100 \le 100c + 10b + a \le 999$

Since $y$ is a three-digit number, its first digit (hundreds digit) cannot be zero.
The hundreds digit of $y$ is $c$. So, $c \ge 1$.
This means $1 \le c \le 9$.

Now, reconsider the possible values of $|a - c|$.
$1 \le a \le 9$
$1 \le c \le 9$

The possible values of $a - c$:
Smallest value: $a=1, c=9 \implies a-c = -8$.
Largest value: $a=9, c=1 \implies a-c = 8$.

The range of $a - c$ is $[-8, 8]$.
The possible integer values of $a - c$ are $-8, -7, ..., 0, ..., 7, 8$.

The possible values of $|a - c|$ are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.
There are $9$ possible values for $|a - c|$.

Let's check if all these values of $|a - c|$ can be achieved given the constraints $1 \le a \le 9$ and $1 \le c \le 9$.

Case 1: $|a - c| = 0 \implies a = c$.
Possible pairs $(a, c)$: $(1, 1), (2, 2), ..., (9, 9)$.

Case 2: $|a - c| = 1 \implies a - c = 1$ or $a - c = -1$.
If $a - c = 1$, pairs $(a, c)$: $(2, 1), (3, 2), ..., (9, 8)$.
If $a - c = -1$, pairs $(a, c)$: $(1, 2), (2, 3), ..., (8, 9)$.

Case 8: $|a - c| = 7 \implies a - c = 7$ or $a - c = -7$.
If $a - c = 7$, pairs $(a, c)$: $(8, 1), (9, 2)$.
If $a - c = -7$, pairs $(a, c)$: $(1, 8), (2, 9)$.

Case 9: $|a - c| = 8 \implies a - c = 8$ or $a - c = -8$.
If $a - c = 8$, pair $(a, c)$: $(9, 1)$.
If $a - c = -8$, pair $(a, c)$: $(1, 9)$.

The possible values of $|a - c|$ are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.
There are $9$ possible values for $|a - c|$.

The distinct values of $z = 99 |a - c|$.
When $|a - c| = 0$, $z = 0$.
When $|a - c| = 1$, $z = 99$.
When $|a - c| = 2, z = 198$.
...
When $|a - c| = 8, z = 99 \times 8 = 792$.

The distinct values of $z$ are $99 \times k$, where $k \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$.
The distinct values of $z$ are $0, 99, 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792$.

There are $9$ distinct values of $z$.

Let's verify the constraints with an example where $|a - c| = 8$.
If $|a - c| = 8$, possible pairs $(a, c)$ are $(9, 1)$ and $(1, 9)$.

If $(a, c) = (9, 1)$, let $b = 0$.
$x = 901, y = 109$.
$z = |901 - 109| = 792$.
$z = 99 \times |9 - 1| = 99 \times 8 = 792$.

If $(a, c) = (1, 9)$, let $b = 0$.
$x = 109, y = 901$.
$z = |109 - 901| = |-792| = 792$.
$z = 99 \times |1 - 9| = 99 \times 8 = 792$.

Consider the constraints carefully.
$x$ and $y$ are both integers between $100$ and $999$, inclusive.
$100 \le x \le 999$
$100 \le y \le 999$

$x = 100a + 10b + c$
$y = 100c + 10b + a$

The condition $100 \le x \le 999$ implies $1 \le a \le 9$, $0 \le b \le 9$, $0 \le c \le 9$.
The condition $100 \le y \le 999$ implies $1 \le c \le 9$, $0 \le b \le 9$, $0 \le a \le 9$.

Combining these, we have:
$1 \le a \le 9$
$0 \le b \le 9$
$1 \le c \le 9$

So, $a \in \{1, ..., 9\}$ and $c \in \{1, ..., 9\}$.

The possible values of $|a - c|$, where $a, c \in \{1, ..., 9\}$.
Smallest value of $|a - c|$ is $0$ (when $a = c$).
Largest value of $|a - c|$ is $8$ (when $a=1, c=9$ or $a=9, c=1$).

Consider the difference $a - c$.
$a \in \{1, ..., 9\}$, $c \in \{1, ..., 9\}$.
Smallest value of $a - c$: $1 - 9 = -8$.
Largest value of $a - c$: $9 - 1 = 8$.
Range of $a - c$: $[-8, 8]$.
Possible values of $a - c$: $-8, -7, ..., 0, ..., 7, 8$.

Possible values of $|a - c|$: $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.
There are $9$ possible values for $|a - c|$.

The distinct values of $z = 99 |a - c|$ are:
$99 \times 0 = 0$
$99 \times 1 = 99$
$99 \times 2 = 198$
$99 \times 3 = 297$
$99 \times 4 = 396$
$99 \times 5 = 495$
$99 \times 6 = 594$
$99 \times 7 = 693$
$99 \times 8 = 792$

There are $9$ distinct values of $z$.

Alternative way to think about the range of $|a - c|$.
Consider a $9 \times 9$ grid of $(a, c)$ values, where $1 \le a \le 9$ and $1 \le c \le 9$.
The value of $|a - c|$ corresponds to the absolute difference between the row and column index (if we index from 1).

Example:
a\c | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
-------------------------
1   | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
2   | 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
3   | 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
4   | 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5
5   | 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4
6   | 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3
7   | 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2
8   | 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1
9   | 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

The values of $|a - c|$ in the grid are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.

The number of distinct values of $z$ is the number of distinct values of $99 |a - c|$.
Since $99$ is a positive constant, the number of distinct values of $z$ is the number of distinct values of $|a - c|$.

Double-checking the problem statement:
$x$ and $y$ are both integers between $100$ and $999$, inclusive.
$y$ is the number formed by reversing the digits of $x$.
$z = |x - y|$.

We need the number of distinct values of $z$.

Example values of $x$:
$x = 123, y = 321, z = |123 - 321| = |-198| = 198$.
$a=1, b=2, c=3$. $|a - c| = |1 - 3| = 2$. $z = 99 \times 2 = 198$.

$x = 987, y = 789, z = |987 - 789| = 198$.
$a=9, b=8, c=7$. $|a - c| = |9 - 7| = 2$. $z = 99 \times 2 = 198$.

Consider the edge cases.
Smallest $x = 100, y = 001 = 1$. This violates the condition on $y$.
Smallest $x$ such that $y$ is also in the range:
If $x = 101, y = 101, z = 0$. $|a - c| = |1 - 1| = 0$.
If $x = 110, y = 011 = 11$. This violates the condition on $y$.

We need $c \neq 0$ for $y$ to be a three-digit number.
If $x = 100$, $a=1, b=0, c=0$. $y=001=1$. Not valid.

The constraint that $y$ is between $100$ and $999$ implies that the hundreds digit of $y$, which is $c$, must be non-zero. So $c \ge 1$.
Similarly, the constraint that $x$ is between $100$ and $999$ implies that the hundreds digit of $x$, which is $a$, must be non-zero. So $a \ge 1$.

So, $1 \le a \le 9$ and $1 \le c \le 9$.

The number of distinct values of $z$ is equal to the number of distinct values of $|a - c|$, where $a, c \in \{1, ..., 9\}$.

The possible values of $|a - c|$ are $0, 1, ..., 8$. There are $9$ such values.
The distinct values of $z$ are $99 \times 0, 99 \times 1, ..., 99 \times 8$.
These are $0, 99, 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792$.
There are $9$ distinct values.

$x, y$ are between $100$ and $999$, inclusive.
$x = 100a + 10b + c$
$y = 100c + 10b + a$

If $z = 0$, then $|a - c| = 0$, so $a = c$.
Example: $x = 121, y = 121, z = 0$.

If $z = 99$, then $|a - c| = 1$.
Example: $a = 2, c = 1, b = 0 \implies x = 201, y = 102, z = |201 - 102| = 99$.

<text>The distinct values of $z$ are $99 \times k$, where $k \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
The distinct values of $z$ are $0, 99, 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792, 891$.

There are $10$ distinct values of $z$.</text>
<explanation>The solver initially concludes there are 10 distinct values of z, but later realizes this is incorrect after discovering additional constraints. This demonstrates monitoring of their own solution process.</explanation>

<text>The distinct values of $z = 99 |a - c|$ are:
$99 \times 0 = 0$
$99 \times 1 = 99$
$99 \times 2 = 198$
$99 \times 3 = 297$
$99 \times 4 = 396$
$99 \times 5 = 495$
$99 \times 6 = 594$
$99 \times 7 = 693$
$99 \times 8 = 792$

There are $9$ distinct values of $z$.</text>
<explanation>After recognizing the additional constraint that c ≥ 1, the solver revises their conclusion to 9 distinct values. This shows metacognitive awareness and willingness to revise earlier conclusions based on new insights.</explanation>

SUMMARY_START
The most important cognitive skills demonstrated in this mathematical problem-solving trajectory are:

1. Problem Representation - The solver effectively translates the problem into mathematical variables and expressions, creating a foundation for the solution.

2. Algebraic Manipulation - The simplification of z = |x-y| to z = 99|a-c| represents a critical insight that transforms the problem into a manageable form.

3. Constraint Analysis - The careful examination of constraints, particularly recognizing that both x and y must be three-digit numbers, leads to the correct range of possible values.

4. Verification and Testing - The solver tests their solution with specific examples and edge cases, which helps identify issues and confirm the final answer.

5. Refinement of Solution - When the solver discovers that c must be at least 1, they revise their analysis, demonstrating the ability to incorporate new insights and adjust the solution accordingly.
