Problem:
Compute the mean molecular speed v in the light gas hydrogen (H2) in m/s

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1750.0

Analysis:
The thinking trajectory provided is very minimal, consisting only of the final answer "1750.0" without showing the intermediate steps or reasoning. This makes it difficult to identify specific cognitive skills demonstrated during the problem-solving process. However, I can analyze what might have happened based on the answer provided.

<text>1750.0</text>
<explanation>The solver must have recalled the formula for mean molecular speed in gases, which is v = √(8RT/πM), where R is the gas constant, T is temperature, and M is molar mass. The fact that they arrived at a specific numerical answer suggests they retrieved this formula and the necessary constants for hydrogen gas.</explanation>
