Problem:
A token starts at the point $(0,0)$ of an $xy$ -coordinate grid and then makes a sequence of six moves. Each move is 1 unit in a direction parallel to one of the coordinate axes. Each move is selected randomly from the four possible directions and independently of the other moves. The probability the token ends at a point on the graph of $|y|=|x|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ , where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$ .

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the probability that a token, starting at $(0,0)$ and making six random moves of length 1 unit parallel to the axes, ends at a point on the graph of $|y|=|x|$. The graph of $|y|=|x|$ consists of the lines $y=x$, $y=-x$. The points on this graph have coordinates $(a, a)$ or $(a, -a)$ or $(-a, a)$ or $(-a, -a)$, where $a$ is an integer.

The token makes six moves, each of length 1, in the directions North, South, East, West, with equal probability $\frac{1}{4}$ for each direction. Let the number of moves in the positive $x$, negative $x$, positive $y$, negative $y$ directions be $n_E, n_W, n_N, n_S$ respectively.
We have $n_E + n_W + n_N + n_S = 6$, where $n_E, n_W, n_N, n_S \ge 0$.

The final position of the token after six moves is $(x, y)$, where:
$x = n_E - n_W$
$y = n_N - n_S$

The total number of possible sequences of six moves is $4^6$, since each of the 6 moves has 4 independent choices of direction.

We need the token to end on the graph of $|y|=|x|$, which means $|n_N - n_S| = |n_E - n_W|$.
This implies $n_N - n_S = n_E - n_W$ or $n_N - n_S = -(n_E - n_W)$.

Case 1: $n_N - n_S = n_E - n_W$
$n_N + n_W = n_E + n_S$

We also know $n_E + n_W + n_N + n_S = 6$.
Substituting $n_N + n_W = n_E + n_S$, we get $2(n_E + n_S) = 6$, so $n_E + n_S = 3$.
Similarly, $2(n_N + n_W) = 6$, so $n_N + n_W = 3$.

We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the system:
$n_E + n_S = 3$
$n_N + n_W = 3$

The number of solutions to $a+b=k$ in non-negative integers is $k+1$.
Number of solutions for $n_E + n_S = 3$ is $3+1 = 4$. The solutions are $(3,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,3)$.
Number of solutions for $n_N + n_W = 3$ is $3+1 = 4$. The solutions are $(3,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,3)$.

For each pair of solutions $(n_E, n_S)$ and $(n_N, n_W)$ that satisfy the conditions, we need to find the number of sequences of 6 moves that correspond to these numbers. This is given by the multinomial coefficient $\binom{6}{n_E, n_W, n_N, n_S} = \frac{6!}{n_E! n_W! n_N! n_S!}$.

We need to sum this over all combinations of $(n_E, n_W, n_N, n_S)$ satisfying $n_E+n_S=3$, $n_N+n_W=3$.

Let's consider the possible values of $(n_E, n_S)$: $(3,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,3)$.
Let's consider the possible values of $(n_N, n_W)$: $(3,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,3)$.

We can form pairs of these solutions. For example, if $(n_E, n_S) = (3,0)$ and $(n_N, n_W) = (3,0)$, then $(n_E, n_W, n_N, n_S) = (3,0,3,0)$. The number of sequences is $\frac{6!}{3!0!3!0!} = \frac{720}{6 \cdot 1 \cdot 6 \cdot 1} = \frac{720}{36} = 20$.

Let's organize the sums:
Sum over $(n_E, n_S)$ such that $n_E+n_S=3$:
- $(3,0)$: $n_E=3, n_S=0$
- $(2,1)$: $n_E=2, n_S=1$
- $(1,2)$: $n_E=1, n_S=2$
- $(0,3)$: $n_E=0, n_S=3$

Sum over $(n_N, n_W)$ such that $n_N+n_W=3$:
- $(3,0)$: $n_N=3, n_W=0$
- $(2,1)$: $n_N=2, n_W=1$
- $(1,2)$: $n_N=1, n_W=2$
- $(0,3)$: $n_N=0, n_W=3$

Consider the contribution to the number of favorable outcomes for Case 1.
Sum over all combinations of $(n_E, n_W, n_N, n_S)$ such that $n_E+n_S=3, n_N+n_W=3$.
This can be viewed as choosing 3 moves to be horizontal (E or W) and 3 moves to be vertical (N or S).
Number of ways to choose 3 horizontal moves out of 6 is $\binom{6}{3}$.
For the 3 horizontal moves, the number of ways to have $n_E$ East and $n_W$ West moves such that $n_E+n_W=3$ is the coefficient of $x^3$ in $(x+x^{-1})^3 = x^3 + 3x + 3x^{-1} + x^{-3}$.
Alternatively, consider the projection onto the x-axis. After 3 horizontal moves, the displacement is $n_E - n_W$.
The possible displacements are $3-0=3, 2-1=1, 1-2=-1, 0-3=-3$.
Number of sequences of 3 horizontal moves: $2^3 = 8$.
Displacement 3: EEE (1 way)
Displacement 1: EEW, EWE, WEE (3 ways)
Displacement -1: WW E, WEW, EWW (3 ways)
Displacement -3: WWW (1 way)

Consider the projection onto the y-axis. After 3 vertical moves, the displacement is $n_N - n_S$.
Possible displacements: $3, 1, -1, -3$.

Let's use a combinatorial argument. We have 6 moves, 3 horizontal and 3 vertical.
Consider the sequence of H (horizontal) and V (vertical) moves. $\binom{6}{3}$ such sequences.
For the 3 horizontal moves, the final x-displacement needs to be considered.
Let the horizontal moves be chosen. There are $2^3 = 8$ ways these moves can be E or W.
Let the vertical moves be chosen. There are $2^3 = 8$ ways these moves can be N or S.
Total number of sequences of 6 moves is $4^6$.

Consider the final position $(x, y)$.
$x = n_E - n_W$, $y = n_N - n_S$.
We are in Case 1 if $y = x$, so $n_N - n_S = n_E - n_W$, or $n_N + n_W = n_E + n_S = 3$.

Let's use a different approach. Consider the net displacement in the x and y directions after 6 moves.
Let the moves be represented by vectors: $(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)$.
Let the number of moves in each direction be $n_E, n_W, n_N, n_S$.
Final position $(n_E - n_W, n_N - n_S)$.
We need $|n_N - n_S| = |n_E - n_W|$.

Consider the symmetry of the problem. The probability of ending at $(a, b)$ is the same as ending at $(\pm a, \pm b)$.

Let $X_i$ be the change in x-coordinate at move $i$, $Y_i$ be the change in y-coordinate at move $i$.
$X_i \in \{1, -1, 0\}$, $Y_i \in \{1, -1, 0\}$.
$(X_i, Y_i) \in \{(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)\}$ with probability $\frac{1}{4}$ each.

Final position $(X, Y) = (\sum_{i=1}^6 X_i, \sum_{i=1}^6 Y_i)$.
We need $P(|Y|=|X|)$.

Let the number of East, West moves be $n_e, n_w$, and North, South moves be $n_n, n_s$.
$n_e+n_w+n_n+n_s = 6$.
$X = n_e - n_w$, $Y = n_n - n_s$.
We need $|n_n - n_s| = |n_e - n_w|$.

Consider the distribution of $X = n_e - n_w$.
Consider the distribution of $Y = n_n - n_s$.

Let $h = n_e - n_w$, $v = n_n - n_s$.
We need $|v| = |h|$, so $v = h$ or $v = -h$.

Case 1: $v = h \implies n_n - n_s = n_e - n_w \implies n_n + n_w = n_e + n_s$.
Since $n_e+n_w+n_n+n_s = 6$, we have $2(n_e+n_s) = 6$, so $n_e+n_s = 3$.
Also $2(n_n+n_w) = 6$, so $n_n+n_w = 3$.

Consider the number of sequences of 6 moves such that $n_e+n_s = 3$ and $n_n+n_w = 3$.
This means 3 moves are horizontal (E or W) and 3 are vertical (N or S).
Number of ways to choose the positions of the 3 horizontal moves is $\binom{6}{3}$.
For the 3 horizontal moves, the number of ways to have $n_e$ East and $n_w$ West is the coefficient of $x^{n_e} y^{n_w}$ in $(x+y)^3$.
We are interested in $n_e - n_w$.

Let's use a generating function approach.
The contribution of each move to the final position is given by the random vector:
$(\pm 1, 0)$ or $(0, \pm 1)$ with probability $\frac{1}{4}$ each.
Generating function for one move: $\frac{1}{4} (x + x^{-1} + y + y^{-1})$.
Generating function for 6 moves: $\frac{1}{4^6} (x + x^{-1} + y + y^{-1})^6$.
We need the sum of coefficients of terms where $|y|=|x|$, i.e., $y=x, y=-x$.
Terms like $x^k y^k$ or $x^k (-x)^k$.

Consider the expansion of $(E+W+N+S)^6$, where E, W, N, S represent the number of moves in each direction. The coefficient of $E^{n_e} W^{n_w} N^{n_n} S^{n_s}$ is $\frac{6!}{n_e! n_w! n_n! n_s!}$.
We need the sum of these coefficients where $|n_n - n_s| = |n_e - n_w|$.

Case 1: $n_n - n_s = n_e - n_w \implies n_n + n_w = n_e + n_s = 3$.
Sum over all $n_e, n_w, n_n, n_s \ge 0$ such that $n_e+n_w=3, n_n+n_s=3$.
The number of such sequences is the coefficient of $a^3 b^3$ in $(aE+aW+bN+bS)^6$.
Consider the expansion of $((E+W)+(N+S))^6 = \sum_{k=0}^6 \binom{6}{k} (E+W)^k (N+S)^{6-k}$.
We need $k=3$, so $\binom{6}{3} (E+W)^3 (N+S)^3$.
$(E+W)^3 = E^3 + 3E^2W + 3EW^2 + W^3$.
$(N+S)^3 = N^3 + 3N^2S + 3NS^2 + S^3$.
The coefficient of $E^{n_e} W^{n_w}$ in $(E+W)^3$ is $\binom{3}{n_e}$.
The coefficient of $N^{n_n} S^{n_s}$ in $(N+S)^3$ is $\binom{3}{n_n}$.

The number of sequences for Case 1 is $\sum_{n_e+n_w=3, n_n+n_s=3} \frac{6!}{n_e! n_w! n_n! n_s!}$.
This is equal to $\binom{6}{3} \times (\text{number of ways to choose 3 horizontal moves}) \times (\text{number of ways to choose 3 vertical moves})$.
Number of ways to have $n_e$ E and $n_w$ W in 3 horizontal moves is $\binom{3}{n_e}$.
Number of ways to have $n_n$ N and $n_s$ S in 3 vertical moves is $\binom{3}{n_n}$.

Consider the final x-displacement after 3 horizontal moves: $h = n_e - n_w$. Possible values are $3, 1, -1, -3$.
Consider the final y-displacement after 3 vertical moves: $v = n_n - n_s$. Possible values are $3, 1, -1, -3$.

Number of paths ending on $y=x$.
We need $n_n - n_s = n_e - n_w$.
Consider the number of walks of 6 steps on a 2D lattice.
Let the steps be $(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)$.

Consider the final displacement $(X, Y)$.
$E(X) = 0, E(Y) = 0$.

Let's use the number of paths directly.
Case 1: $y=x$. Final position $(k, k)$ for some integer $k$.
$n_e - n_w = k$, $n_n - n_s = k$.
$n_e - n_w = n_n - n_s$.

Case 2: $y=-x$. Final position $(k, -k)$ for some integer $k$.
$n_n - n_s = -(n_e - n_w) = n_w - n_e$.
$n_n + n_e = n_s + n_w$.
Since $n_e+n_w+n_n+n_s = 6$, we have $2(n_n+n_e) = 6$, so $n_n+n_e = 3$.
Also $2(n_s+n_w) = 6$, so $n_s+n_w = 3$.

Number of sequences for Case 2: sum over $n_e+n_n=3, n_w+n_s=3$.
Consider arranging 3 'type 1' moves and 3 'type 2' moves.
Type 1: E or N. Type 2: W or S.
Example sequence: E N E W S N.
Contribution to x: +1 +1 -1 = 1
Contribution to y: +1 -1 = 0.

Consider the total number of paths that end on $y=x$.
Final position $(k, k)$, so $n_e - n_w = k, n_n - n_s = k$.
Sum over $k = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3$.

Consider the number of paths ending at $(k, k)$.
Number of East moves - Number of West moves = $k$.
Number of North moves - Number of South moves = $k$.

Let's use a simpler approach. Consider the symmetry.
Probability of ending at $(x, y)$ is the same as ending at $(\pm x, \pm y)$.

Consider the binomial distribution for x and y displacements.
After 6 horizontal moves (imagine only horizontal moves), the displacement is $X = n_E - n_W$.
$n_E + n_W = 6$. $X = 2n_E - 6$.
$n_E$ follows Binomial(6, 1/2).
$P(n_E=k) = \binom{6}{k} (1/2)^k (1/2)^{6-k} = \binom{6}{k} (1/2)^6$.
Possible values of $X$: $-6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6$.
$P(X=k)$ can be calculated.

Similarly, for vertical displacement $Y = n_N - n_S$.
$P(Y=k)$ can be calculated.

We need $P(|Y|=|X|)$.
Possible values of $|X|, |Y|$ are $0, 2, 4, 6$.

Case 1: $|X|=0, |Y|=0$. $X=0, Y=0$.
$n_E=3, n_W=3, n_N=3, n_S=3$. Not possible since sum is 6.

We need the probability of the final position being on $y=x$ or $y=-x$.

Consider the expected value of the final position: $(0, 0)$.

Consider the number of paths ending at $(k, k)$.
We need $n_e - n_w = k$, $n_n - n_s = k$.
$n_e + n_w + n_n + n_s = 6$.
$n_e - n_w - n_n + n_s = 0$.

Number of paths ending at $(0, 0)$.
$n_e = n_w, n_n = n_s$.
$2n_e + 2n_n = 6$, $n_e + n_n = 3$.
Pairs $(n_e, n_n)$: $(0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0)$.
Terms: $\frac{6!}{0!0!3!3!} + \frac{6!}{1!1!2!2!} + \frac{6!}{2!2!1!1!} + \frac{6!}{3!3!0!0!} = 20 + 180 + 180 + 20 = 400$.

Number of paths ending at $(1, 1)$.
$n_e - n_w = 1, n_n - n_s = 1$.
$n_e = n_w + 1, n_n = n_s + 1$.
$n_w+1+n_w+n_s+1+n_s = 6 \implies 2n_w + 2n_s = 4 \implies n_w+n_s=2$.
Pairs $(n_w, n_s)$: $(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)$.
$(n_e, n_n) = (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)$.
Terms: $\frac{6!}{1!0!3!2!} + \frac{6!}{2!1!2!1!} + \frac{6!}{3!2!1!0!} = 60 + 180 + 60 = 300$.

Number of paths ending at $(-1, -1)$. Same as $(1, 1)$, so 300.

Number of paths ending at $(1, -1)$.
$n_e - n_w = 1, n_n - n_s = -1$.
$n_e = n_w + 1, n_s = n_n + 1$.
$n_w+1+n_w+n_n+n_n+1 = 6 \implies 2n_w + 2n_n = 4 \implies n_w+n_n=2$.
Pairs $(n_w, n_n)$: $(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)$.
$(n_e, n_s) = (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)$.
Terms are the same as for $(1, 1)$, sum = 300.

Consider cases where $|x|=|y|$.
Final positions $(k, k), (k, -k), (-k, k), (-k, -k)$.

Number of paths ending on $y=x$:
$(0,0)$: 400
$(1,1), (-1,-1)$: $300 \times 2 = 600$
$(2,2)$: $n_e - n_w = 2, n_n - n_s = 2$. $n_e = n_w+2, n_n = n_s+2$.
$n_w+2+n_w+n_s+2+n_s = 6 \implies 2n_w+2n_s = 2 \implies n_w+n_s=1$.
$(0,1), (1,0)$.
$(n_e, n_n) = (2,3), (3,2)$.
$\frac{6!}{2!0!3!1!} + \frac{6!}{3!0!2!1!} = 60 + 60 = 120$.
Number of paths to $(2,2)$ is 120. Number to $(-2,-2)$ is 120.

Number of paths ending on $y=-x$:
$(0,0)$: already counted.
$(1,-1), (-1,1)$: 300 each.
$(2,-2), (-2,2)$: number of paths to $(2,-2)$ is 120.
Total number of favorable paths = $400 + 600 + 240 + 600 + 240 = 2080$.
Total number of paths = $4^6 = 4096$.
Probability = $\frac{2080}{4096} = \frac{1040}{2048} = \frac{520}{1024} = \frac{260}{512} = \frac{130}{256} = \frac{65}{128}$.

$m=65, n=128$. $m, n$ are relatively prime.
$m+n = 65 + 128 = 193$.

$(1,-1), (-1,1)$: 300 each.
$(2,-2), (-2,2)$: number of paths to $(2,-2)$ is 120.</text>
<explanation>The solver systematically counts the number of paths ending at each type of point on the lines y=x and y=-x, using combinatorial formulas like factorials and multinomial coefficients to determine the exact count for each case.</explanation>

<skill>Case Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to break down a problem into distinct cases or scenarios and analyze each separately before combining results.</definition>

<start>820</start>
<end>1030</end>
<text>We need the token to end on the graph of $|y|=|x|$, which means $|n_N - n_S| = |n_E - n_W|$.
This implies $n_N - n_S = n_E - n_W$ or $n_N - n_S = -(n_E - n_W)$.

Case 1: $n_N - n_S = n_E - n_W$
$n_N + n_W = n_E + n_S$</text>
<explanation>The solver breaks down the condition |y|=|x| into two distinct cases: when y=x and when y=-x. This case analysis is crucial for organizing the solution approach and handling the absolute value condition.</explanation>

<start>2967</start>
<end>3202</end>
<text>Case 1: $v = h \implies n_n - n_s = n_e - n_w \implies n_n + n_w = n_e + n_s$.
Since $n_e+n_w+n_n+n_s = 6$, we have $2(n_e+n_s) = 6$, so $n_e+n_s = 3$.
Also $2(n_n+n_w) = 6$, so $n_n+n_w = 3$.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes the first case (v=h) in detail, deriving additional constraints from the original conditions. This systematic approach to case analysis helps make the problem more tractable.</explanation>

<start>5462</start>
<end>5673</end>
<text>Case 2: $y=-x$. Final position $(k, -k)$ for some integer $k$.
$n_n - n_s = -(n_e - n_w) = n_w - n_e$.
$n_n + n_e = n_s + n_w$.
Since $n_e+n_w+n_n+n_s = 6$, we have $2(n_n+n_e) = 6$, so $n_n+n_e = 3$.
Also $2(n_s+n_w) = 6$, so $n_s+n_w = 3$.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes the second case (y=-x) separately, deriving constraints specific to this case. This demonstrates a thorough approach to case analysis, ensuring all possibilities are covered.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to transform mathematical expressions and equations to reveal relationships, simplify calculations, or isolate variables of interest.</definition>

<start>1031</start>
<end>1186</end>
<text>We also know $n_E + n_W + n_N + n_S = 6$.
Substituting $n_N + n_W = n_E + n_S$, we get $2(n_E + n_S) = 6$, so $n_E + n_S = 3$.
Similarly, $2(n_N + n_W) = 6$, so $n_N + n_W = 3$.</text>
<explanation>The solver manipulates the equations by substituting one into another to derive simpler constraints. This algebraic manipulation transforms the original complex condition into more manageable equations.</explanation>

<start>7122</start>
<end>7197</end>
<text>$m=65, n=128$. $m, n$ are relatively prime.
$m+n = 65 + 128 = 193$.</text>
<explanation>The solver performs the final algebraic step of identifying the values of m and n from the probability fraction, and verifying that they are relatively prime before calculating their sum.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Simplification</skill>
<definition>The ability to recognize when a problem can be simplified through alternative approaches, abstraction, or reformulation.</definition>

<start>4566</start>
<end>4740</end>
<text>Consider the expected value of the final position: $(0, 0)$.

Consider the number of paths ending at $(k, k)$.
We need $n_e - n_w = k$, $n_n - n_s = k$.
$n_e + n_w + n_n + n_s = 6$.
$n_e - n_w - n_n + n_s = 0$.

Let's use a simpler approach. Consider the symmetry.
Probability of ending at $(x, y)$ is the same as ending at $(\pm x, \pm y)$.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that their initial approach might be too complex and pivots to a simpler strategy based on symmetry. This demonstrates the ability to simplify the problem by changing perspective.</explanation>

<start>5844</start>
<end>6226</end>
<text>Number of paths ending at $(0, 0)$.
$n_e = n_w, n_n = n_s$.
$2n_e + 2n_n = 6$, $n_e + n_n = 3$.
Pairs $(n_e, n_n)$: $(0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0)$.
Terms: $\frac{6!}{0!0!3!3!} + \frac{6!}{1!1!2!2!} + \frac{6!}{2!2!1!1!} + \frac{6!}{3!3!0!0!} = 20 + 180 + 180 + 20 = 400$.</text>
<explanation>The solver simplifies the calculation for paths ending at (0,0) by identifying the specific constraints and systematically working through the possible combinations of moves. This strategic simplification makes the calculation more manageable.</explanation>
