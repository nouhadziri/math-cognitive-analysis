Problem:
Let  $D$  be the complex unit disk  $D=\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z|<1\}$ , and  $0<a<1$  a real number. Suppose that  $f:D \to \mathbb{C}\setminus \{0\}$  is a holomorphic function such that  $f(a)=1$  and  $f(-a)=-1$ . Prove that  $$  \sup_{z \in D} |f(z)| \geqslant \exp\left(\frac{1-a^2}{4a}\pi\right) . $$  

Domain: Complex functions

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Define the problem and initial setup:**
   Let \( D \) be the complex unit disk \( D = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z| < 1 \} \), and let \( 0 < a < 1 \) be a real number. Suppose that \( f : D \to \mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\} \) is a holomorphic function such that \( f(a) = 1 \) and \( f(-a) = -1 \). We need to prove that 
   \[
   \sup_{z \in D} |f(z)| \geq \exp\left( \frac{1 - a^2}{4a} \pi \right).
   \]

2. **Transform the function \( f \):**
   Since \( f \) maps to \( \mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\} \), there exists a holomorphic function \( g : D \to \mathbb{C} \) such that \( f = \exp(g) \). We can shift \( g \) by a constant so that \( g(a) = 0 \) and \( g(-a) = n\pi i \) for some odd integer \( n \).

3. **Introduce the Blaschke factor:**
   Let 
   \[
   k_a(z) = \frac{a - z}{1 - \overline{a}z} = \frac{a - z}{1 - az}
   \]
   be the Blaschke factor for \( a \). This is a conformal mapping \( D \to D \) that swaps \( 0 \) with \( a \) and is its own inverse.

4. **Define the supremum of the real part of \( g \):**
   Let \( m = \sup_{z \in D} \Re(g(z)) \). By the open mapping theorem, \( \Re(g(z)) < m \) strictly. We assume \( m \) is finite, since \( e^m = \sup_{z \in D} |f(z)| \).

5. **Construct a new holomorphic function:**
   Define 
   \[
   h(z) = \frac{g(k_a(z))}{2m - g(k_a(z))}
   \]
   which is a holomorphic function mapping \( D \) to \( D \). This function satisfies \( h(0) = 0 \) and 
   \[
   h\left( \frac{2a}{1 + a^2} \right) = \frac{n\pi i}{2m - n\pi i}.
   \]

6. **Apply the Schwarz lemma:**
   By the Schwarz lemma, we have 
   \[
   \left| h\left( \frac{2a}{1 + a^2} \right) \right| \leq \left| \frac{2a}{1 + a^2} \right|.
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left| \frac{n\pi i}{2m - n\pi i} \right| \leq \frac{2a}{1 + a^2}.
   \]

7. **Simplify the inequality:**
   Simplifying the above inequality, we get
   \[
   \frac{n\pi}{|2m - n\pi i|} \leq \frac{2a}{1 + a^2}.
   \]
   Squaring both sides, we obtain
   \[
   \frac{n^2 \pi^2}{4m^2 + n^2 \pi^2} \leq \frac{4a^2}{(1 + a^2)^2}.
   \]
   Rearranging terms, we get
   \[
   4m^2 \leq n^2 \pi^2 \left( \frac{(1 + a^2)^2 - 4a^2}{4a^2} \right).
   \]
   Simplifying further, we find
   \[
   4m^2 \leq n^2 \pi^2 \left( \frac{1 - a^2}{4a^2} \right).
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   m \geq \frac{1 - a^2}{4a} \pi.
   \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   Since \( e^m = \sup_{z \in D} |f(z)| \), we have
   \[
   \sup_{z \in D} |f(z)| \geq \exp\left( \frac{1 - a^2}{4a} \pi \right).
   \]

The final answer is \( \boxed{ \exp\left( \frac{1 - a^2}{4a} \pi \right) } \).

<explanation>The solver transforms the problem by focusing on the supremum of the real part of g, connecting it to the original problem through the relation e^m = sup|f(z)|.

   \[
   h\left( \frac{2a}{1 + a^2} \right) = \frac{n\pi i}{2m - n\pi i}.
   \]</text>

   \frac{n\pi}{|2m - n\pi i|} \leq \frac{2a}{1 + a^2}.
   \]
   Squaring both sides, we obtain

   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   m \geq \frac{1 - a^2}{4a} \pi.
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver performs a sequence of algebraic manipulations to simplify the inequality obtained from the Schwarz lemma.

The final answer is \( \boxed{ \exp\left( \frac{1 - a^2}{4a} \pi \right) } \).</text>
<explanation>The solver completes the proof by connecting the derived lower bound for m back to the original problem.

<explanation>The solver makes a logical deduction that since f is non-zero and holomorphic, it can be expressed as f = exp(g) for some holomorphic function g. Furthermore, they deduce that g can be shifted to satisfy specific conditions at the points a and -a, which follows from the given conditions on f.</explanation>
