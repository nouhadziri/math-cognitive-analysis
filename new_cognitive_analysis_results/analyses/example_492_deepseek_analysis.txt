Problem:
A molecule consists of three atoms with spin ½ each. The spin vector of the molecule can be written as $s = \sigma/2$, where $\sigma$ are Pauli matrices. The interaction Hamiltonian of the molecule is due to spin interactions and can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} = \frac{\lambda}{3} [ (\sigma_1 \cdot  \sigma_2) + (\sigma_2 \cdot \sigma_3) + (\sigma_3 \cdot \sigma_1)]
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ describes the strength of the interaction and $\sigma_{1,2,3}$ are Pauli spin matrices for individual atoms, which commute among themselves such that $\sigma_1^2 =\sigma_2^2= \sigma_3^2 = 1$ and the total spin of the molecule is 
\begin{equation}
	S = s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = \frac{1}{2} (\sigma_1 + \sigma_2 + \sigma_3)
\end{equation}
Every atom can have spin projections $\pm \frac{1}{2}$ for any choice of the quantization axis. The spin vectors have the properties
\begin{equation}
	S^2 = S(S+1),  s^2 = s(s+1)=\frac{3}{4}
\end{equation}

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a molecule with three spin-1⁄2 atoms. The question is about determining the correct description of the molecular states based on the given interaction Hamiltonian. The answer choices are A through D, each suggesting different combinations of quadruplets and doublets. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I recall that when dealing with multiple spins, the total spin can combine in different ways. For two spin-1⁄2 particles, the total spin can be either singlet (S=0) or triplet (S=1). But here, we have three spin-1⁄2 particles, which is a bit more complicated. The total spin S will be the sum of the three individual spins. But how do the multiple combinations work here?

The problem mentions that each atom has spin 1⁄2, so the possible total spins can combine to different values. For three spin-1⁄2's, the possible total spins could be S = 3/2 (quartet) and S = 1/2 (doublet). The possible ways to combine three spins can be done by adding two first and then adding the third. Let's see: adding two spin-1⁄2 particles gives S=1 and S=0. Then adding the third spin-1⁄2 to each.

Adding a spin-1⁄2 to S=1: this can give total S = 3/2 or 1/2. Similarly, adding a spin-1⁄2 to S=0 gives total S=1/2. So overall, for three spin-1⁄2 particles, the possible total spins are S=3/2 (a quartet) and S=1/2 (two doublets). Wait, but how many doublets are there? Let me think again.

If I couple the first two spins to S12=1 and S12=0. Coupling S12=1 with the third spin (s=1/2) will give S_total = 1 + 1/2 → possible 3/2 and 1/2. Then coupling S12=0 with the third spin gives S_total = 0 + 1/2 = 1/2. So combining all possibilities, we get one quartet (S=3/2) and two doublets (each S=1/2). But since the two doublets might have different symmetries or something else, are they identical?

But maybe in this case, due to permutation symmetry among the three atoms, the two doublets might be combined in a way that they are equivalent. Wait, but the problem says the Hamiltonian is given by a sum of pairwise dot products of Pauli matrices. So the Hamiltonian is symmetric under permutations of the three atoms. So the eigenstates should be classified according to their total spin and possibly their permutation symmetry.

But first, let's compute the expression for the Hamiltonian. It's given by H = λ/3 [σ1·σ2 + σ2·σ3 + σ3·σ1]. The problem statement also tells us that S is the total spin vector (as s1 + s2 + s3) where each s_i = σ_i /2. Then S^2 = s(s+1), so S^2 = ( (σ1 + σ2 + σ3)/2 )^2 = (σ1 + σ2 + σ3)^2 /4.

Expanding the square, (σ1 + σ2 + σ3)^2 = σ1^2 + σ2^2 + σ3^2 + 2(σ1·σ2 + σ1·σ3 + σ2·σ3). But we know that σ_i^2 = 1 for each Pauli matrix. So this becomes (3*1) + 2(sum σi·σj). Therefore, (sum (σi·σj)) = [ (σ1 + σ2 + σ3)^2 - 3 ] / 2.

Plugging this into the Hamiltonian:

H = (λ/3) * [ sum (σi·σj) ] = (λ/3) * [ (S_total * 2)^2 - 3 ) / 2 ]

Wait, let me double-check. Wait, S = (1/2)(σ1 + σ2 + σ3), so σ1 + σ2 + σ3 = 2S. Thus, (σ1 + σ2 + σ3)^2 = 4S^2. So:

sum(σi·σj) = (σ1 + σ2 + σ3)^2 - (σ1^2 + σ2^2 + σ3^2) = 4S^2 - 3*1 = 4S^2 -3.

So then our Hamiltonian H is (λ/3) * [ (4S^2 -3)/2 * (each term in the sum?) Wait, no, the sum σ1·σ2 + σ2·σ3 + σ3·σ1 is equal to 4S^2 -3 divided by ? Wait, actually:

Let me compute sum_{i<j} σi·σj:

Sum(σ1·σ2 + σ2·σ3 + σ3·σ1) = (σ1 + σ2 + σ3)^2 - (σ1^2 + σ2^2 + σ3^2) ) / 2. Since each σi·σj is (σi sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i)/2?

Wait no, Pauli matrices satisfy σi · σj = δ_{ij} I + i ε_{ijk} σk. Hmm, maybe that's more complex.

But perhaps another approach is better. Wait, σ_i · σ_j is a shorthand for the sum over the three Pauli matrices components: σ_i^x σ_j^x + σ_i^y σ_j^y + σ_i^z σ_j^z. And so when summed over i < j, this becomes:

Sum_{i < j} σ_i · σ_j.

But as per the problem statement, the sum σ1·σ2 + σ2·σ3 + σ3·σ1 is that exact sum. So using our previous expansion:

Sum_{i < j} σ_i · σ_j = [ (σ1 + σ2 + σ3)^2 - (σ1^2 + σ2^2 + σ3^2) ] / 2.

Since each σ_i^2 = 3*(1/2)(1/2 +1) ?? Wait no, the σ_i here are Pauli matrices acting on their respective spaces. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But actually, each σ_i in this context is a vector of Pauli matrices. Therefore, σ_i^2 would be (σ_i^x)^2 + (σ_i^y)^2 + (σ_i^z)^2. But each (σ_i^α)^2 is identity matrix for each α, so σ_i^2 = 3 * I, for each i.

Wait hold on. If σ_i are the Pauli matrices, then σ_i^2 for each component (x,y,z) is the identity matrix. But then, for the vector σ_i · σ_j, is that sum over α of σ_i^α σ_j^α. Then σ_i · σ_i would be σ_i^x σ_i^x + ... = 3I. Wait, but maybe in the problem statement they mean that each σ_i^2 = 1. Wait, the problem says: the spin vector of the molecule is written as s = σ/2, and the properties are s^2 = s(s+1) = 3/4. But if s = σ/2, then s^2 would be (σ/2)^2 = σ^2 /4 = 3/4. Hence σ^2 = 3, so for the Pauli matrices? Wait, but individual σ_i are Pauli matrices acting on different particles. So σ_i^2 would be a 2x2 identity matrix for each particle, right? Wait, each σ_i is a vector of Pauli matrices. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, but the problem states: σ1^2 = σ2^2 = σ3^2 = 1. Hmm, maybe this is a problem-specific notation. Normally, the square of a Pauli vector (σ) would be 3, but here they say σ1^2 = 1. Wait, each Pauli matrix σ_i (as a vector) has components σ_i^x, σ_i^y, σ_i^z, so σ_i^2 would be (σ_i^x)^2 + (σ_i^y)^2 + (σ_i^z)^2. But each (σ_i^α)^2 is 1 (since the Pauli matrices squared are identity matrices). So, σ_i^2 = 3 * I. But in the problem statement, it's written as σ_i^2 = 1. Maybe they are using some different normalization?

Alternatively, maybe here σ_i refers not to the vector of Pauli matrices but some scalar quantity? But no, the problem says "Pauli spin matrices" for individual atoms and refers to σ_1 ⋅ σ_2 as the dot product. So the standard dot product, which expands to σ1^x σ2^x + σ1^y σ2^y + σ1^z σ2^z.

Given that σ1, σ2, σ3 are Pauli matrices acting on different particles, so they commute with each other, and their squares: for σ_i^2, each component (x,y,z) is a Pauli matrix squared, which is identity. Therefore, for the "vector" σ_i, when we talk about σ_i^2, that would be 3I? But the problem writes σ1^2 = σ2^2 = σ3^2 = 1. Maybe they have a different convention here. Wait, the original Hamiltonian is written as λ/3 times the sum of σ_i ⋅ σ_j terms. So H is constructed as a scalar combination of these dot products.

But going back to the fact that in the problem statement, S is defined as s1 + s2 + s3 = (σ1 + σ2 + σ3)/2. Then, the square of S is S(S+1). But let's compute S^2 in terms of the σ's.

S^2 = ( (σ1 + σ2 + σ3)/2 )^2 = (σ1^2 + σ2^2 + σ3^2 + 2 σ1⋅σ2 + 2 σ1⋅σ3 + 2 σ2⋅σ3)/4.

But according to the problem statement, σ_i^2 = 1, so this simplifies to (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 sum σ_i⋅σ_j )/4 = [3 + 2 sum σ_i⋅σ_j ] /4.

But also, S^2 is supposed to equal S(S +1). So maybe S can take on values like 3/2 and 1/2. Let's consider possible eigenvalues.

For three spin-1/2 particles, as I thought earlier, the total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2. So S(S +1) would be (3/2)(5/2) = 15/4 or (1/2)(3/2) = 3/4.

But for how the terms combine: sum σ_i⋅σ_j. Let's see if we can express sum σ_i⋅σ_j in terms of S^2.

From the previous equation,

S^2 = [3 + 2 sum σ_i⋅σ_j ] /4

Hence, 4 S^2 - 3 = 2 sum σ_i⋅σ_j.

Hence, sum σ_i⋅σ_j = (4 S^2 -3)/2

But in the Hamiltonian, we have H = (λ/3)(sum σ_i⋅σ_j) = (λ/3)( (4 S^2 -3)/2 ) = (λ/6)(4 S^2 -3 )

Therefore, H can be rewritten in terms of S^2 as H = (2 λ/3) S^2 - (λ/2 )

Since S^2 has eigenvalues S(S+1), substituting into H gives: H = (2λ/3) S(S+1) - λ/2.

Therefore, for each possible total spin S, we can compute the energy E = (2λ/3) S(S+1) - λ/2.

So, for S = 3/2:

E_quartet = (2λ/3)(15/4) - λ/2 = (30λ/12) - (6λ/12) = 24λ/12 = 2λ.

For S = 1/2:

E_doublet = (2λ/3)(3/4) - λ/2 = (6λ/12) - (6λ/12) = 0.

So actually, the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues split into 2λ for the quartet state (S=3/2) and 0 for the doublet states (S=1/2). Wait, so depending on the multiplicity.

But we need to know how many states correspond to each S.

For S = 3/2 (a quartet), the multiplicity is 2S +1 = 4, so 4 states.

For S = 1/2 (a doublet), the multiplicity is 2, so each S=1/2 state has 2 states. Now, how many distinct S=1/2 states are there?

In the case of three spin-1⁄2 particles, the number of total states is 2^3=8. Let's confirm the dimensions:

Quartet (S=3/2): 4 states.

Doublets: For three spins, the total Hilbert space is 8-dimensional. If we have one quartet (4 states) and two doublets (each 2 states), that would account for 8 states (4 + 2 + 2). So two doublet states. Hence, the possible degeneracies are 4 (for quartet) and two sets of 2 (doublets).

Thus, the Hamiltonian splits the 8-dimensional space into one 4-dimensional space (quartet) with energy 2λ, and two 2-dimensional spaces (doublets) each with energy 0. Therefore, the molecular states consist of a quadruplet and two doublets.

Looking back at the answer choices:

(A) 2 quadruplets → 2×4=8, but there's only one quartet.

(B) 4 doublets → 4×2=8, but it's supposed to be 1 quartet and two doublets.

(C) 1 quadruplet and 3 identical doublets → 1×4 +3×2=10. Too much.

(D) 1 quadruplet and 2 identical doublets → 1×4 +2×2=8. Matches.

But before confirming D, wait: are the two doublets identical? Because if their energies are the same (both at 0), then the degeneracy is 4 (combining two doublets). But in quantum mechanics, usually, states with the same energy are considered part of the same multiplet unless there's some symmetry that separates them.

Wait, but in terms of the Hamiltonian, each S=1/2 state would have the same energy. Therefore, if there's a degenerate subspace with two separate doublets, but with the same energy, perhaps they are distinguished by another quantum number, but if symmetry doesn't split them, they would form a 4-dimensional space. However, in the problem statement, the possible eigenstates are determined by the total spin, so S=3/2 (quartet) and S=1/2 (two doublets), but in total Hilbert space, how does that decomposition work?

Wait, more carefully: when you have three spin-1⁄2's, the decomposition into irreducible representations (irreps) is as follows. The space is (C^2)^⊗3 = C^8. The decomposition into spin states is: ( (1⁄2)⊗(1⁄2) )⊗(1⁄2) = ( (1 ⊕ 0) )⊗(1⁄2) ) = (1⊗1⁄2) ⊕ (0⊗1⁄2) ) = (3/2 ⊕ 1/2) ⊕ 1/2. Therefore, the total decomposition is a spin 3/2 (quartet) and two spin 1/2 (doublet) states. So indeed, one quartet and two doublets.

However, those two doublets may have different symmetry properties under permutation of the particles. For example, some might be symmetric and others antisymmetric under exchange of particles. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is symmetric under permutations of all three particles (since it's a sum over all pairs σ_i⋅σ_j), so each irrep (each S subspace) would have definite symmetry. However, since the two doublets are two different irreps with the same S but different permutation symmetries, or might they mix?

Wait, permutational symmetry of three particles: Using Young diagrams, for three spin-1⁄2 particles, the decomposition into SU(2) irreps as we have: total dimensions 8. The decomposition would be into Spin 3/2 (dimension 4) and two Spin 1/2 (each dimension 2).

But is the second Spin 1/2 (the other doublet) from a different permutation symmetry? For example, when combining first two spins into triplet (S=1) or singlet (S=0), then adding the third spin. As per addition:

If two spin-1⁄2’s added to S=1 and S=0. Then adding the third spin-1⁄2:

For S=1 + 1⁄2: gives 3/2 and 1/2.

For S=0 + 1⁄2: gives 1/2.

Thus, in total, 3/2, 1/2 (from S=1 + 1⁄2), and 1/2 (from S=0 + 1⁄2). But these two 1/2 states may not mix unless the Hamiltonian can connect them.

But in this case, the Hamiltonian is permutationally invariant. So perhaps there are multiple copies of the same S=1/2, but they would correspond to different permutation symmetry classes. However, when you compose three particles in such a symmetric Hamiltonian, the eigenstates may be states in each individual irrep.

But the exact description is a quartet and two doublets, each doublet corresponding to different permutation symmetries. Therefore, in the decomposition, even though the two doublets have the same S=1/2, they may belong to different permutation symmetry sectors. Therefore, the eigenstates of H (since H is symmetric) would lie within each irrep. Therefore, each doublet is actually a separate symmetry sector. However, since they both have the same energy (since H depends only on S), perhaps the two doublets are degenerate.

Therefore, in terms of molecular states (the eigenstates of H), they are: one quartet (with energy E=2λ) and two doublets (each with energy E=0). Since the two doublets have the same energy, they are identical in energy (though distinct in state). Therefore, if the question is asking about the description in terms of energy levels, the system has a quartet with energy 2λ and two doublets with energy 0. So the total states would be one quadruplet and two doublets. The answer D: 1 quadruplet and 2 identical doublets. "Identical" might refer to them having the same energy (and thus same if they are considered as energy levels), even though they are distinct states. So the answer should be D.

In that case, I think the correct option is (D).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{D}

Let's see: adding two spin-1⁄2 particles gives S=1 and S=0. Then adding the third spin-1⁄2 to each.

Adding a spin-1⁄2 to S=1: this can give total S = 3/2 or 1/2. Similarly, adding a spin-1⁄2 to S=0 gives total S=1/2.</text>

For S=1 + 1⁄2: gives 3/2 and 1/2.

For S=0 + 1⁄2: gives 1/2.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses group theory concepts (Young diagrams and SU(2) irreducible representations) to analyze the decomposition of the Hilbert space. They connect this to the angular momentum coupling scheme to understand the origin of the two doublet states, demonstrating sophisticated understanding of the mathematical structure of quantum mechanical systems.</explanation>

<text>Therefore, the molecular states consist of a quadruplet and two doublets.

Looking back at the answer choices:

(A) 2 quadruplets → 2×4=8, but there's only one quartet.

(B) 4 doublets → 4×2=8, but it's supposed to be 1 quartet and two doublets.

(C) 1 quadruplet and 3 identical doublets → 1×4 +3×2=10. Too much.

(D) 1 quadruplet and 2 identical doublets → 1×4 +2×2=8. Matches.</text>
<explanation>The solver systematically evaluates each answer choice against their analysis, checking whether the proposed combinations of quadruplets and doublets match the correct decomposition of the Hilbert space. They verify both the types of states and that the total dimension adds up correctly.</explanation>

<text>Therefore, the eigenstates of H (since H is symmetric) would lie within each irrep. Therefore, each doublet is actually a separate symmetry sector. However, since they both have the same energy (since H depends only on S), perhaps the two doublets are degenerate.

Therefore, in terms of molecular states (the eigenstates of H), they are: one quartet (with energy E=2λ) and two doublets (each with energy E=0). Since the two doublets have the same energy, they are identical in energy (though distinct in state). Therefore, if the question is asking about the description in terms of energy levels, the system has a quartet with energy 2λ and two doublets with energy 0.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies their analysis by considering both the state structure and energy levels. They confirm that while the two doublets are distinct states (from different symmetry sectors), they have the same energy, which is relevant for interpreting what "identical doublets" means in the answer choices.</explanation>
