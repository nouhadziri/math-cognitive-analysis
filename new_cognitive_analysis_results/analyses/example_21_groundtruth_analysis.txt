Problem:
Carl chooses a *functional expression**  $E$  which is a finite nonempty string formed from a set  $x_1, x_2, \dots$  of variables and applications of a function  $f$ , together with addition, subtraction, multiplication (but not division), and fixed real constants. He then considers the equation  $E = 0$ , and lets  $S$  denote the set of functions  $f \colon \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$  such that the equation holds for any choices of real numbers  $x_1, x_2, \dots$ . (For example, if Carl chooses the functional equation  $$  f(2f(x_1)+x_2) - 2f(x_1)-x_2 = 0,  $$  then  $S$  consists of one function, the identity function.

(a) Let  $X$  denote the set of functions with domain  $\mathbb R$  and image exactly  $\mathbb Z$ . Show that Carl can choose his functional equation such that  $S$  is nonempty but  $S \subseteq X$ .

(b) Can Carl choose his functional equation such that  $|S|=1$  and  $S \subseteq X$ ?

*These can be defined formally in the following way: the set of functional expressions is the minimal one (by inclusion) such that (i) any fixed real constant is a functional expression, (ii) for any positive integer  $i$ , the variable  $x_i$  is a functional expression, and (iii) if  $V$  and  $W$  are functional expressions, then so are  $f(V)$ ,  $V+W$ ,  $V-W$ , and  $V \cdot W$ .

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
### Part (a)

1. **Define the Set \( X \)**:
   Let \( X \) denote the set of functions with domain \( \mathbb{R} \) and image exactly \( \mathbb{Z} \). This means that for any function \( f \in X \), \( f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{Z} \).

2. **Construct a Functional Equation**:
   We need to construct a functional equation \( E = 0 \) such that the set \( S \) of functions \( f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying \( E = 0 \) is nonempty and \( S \subseteq X \).

3. **Choose a Suitable Functional Equation**:
   Consider the functional equation:
   \[
   f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor
   \]
   where \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) denotes the floor function, which maps any real number \( x \) to the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \).

4. **Verify the Properties**:
   - The floor function \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) maps \( \mathbb{R} \) to \( \mathbb{Z} \), so it belongs to \( X \).
   - The equation \( f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor \) holds for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   The set \( S \) is nonempty (since it contains at least the floor function) and \( S \subseteq X \) (since the floor function maps \( \mathbb{R} \) to \( \mathbb{Z} \)).

### Part (b)

1. **Define the Set \( X \)**:
   As in part (a), let \( X \) denote the set of functions with domain \( \mathbb{R} \) and image exactly \( \mathbb{Z} \).

2. **Construct a Functional Equation with Unique Solution**:
   We need to construct a functional equation \( E = 0 \) such that the set \( S \) of functions \( f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying \( E = 0 \) has exactly one element and \( S \subseteq X \).

3. **Choose a Suitable Functional Equation**:
   Consider the functional equation:
   \[
   f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor
   \]
   This equation uniquely determines the function \( f \) as the floor function.

4. **Verify the Uniqueness**:
   - The floor function \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) is the only function that maps \( \mathbb{R} \) to \( \mathbb{Z} \) and satisfies \( f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).
   - No other function can satisfy this equation and map \( \mathbb{R} \) to \( \mathbb{Z} \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   The set \( S \) has exactly one element (the floor function) and \( S \subseteq X \).

The final answer is \( \boxed{ f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor } \)
