Problem:
A token starts at the point $(0,0)$ of an $xy$ -coordinate grid and then makes a sequence of six moves. Each move is 1 unit in a direction parallel to one of the coordinate axes. Each move is selected randomly from the four possible directions and independently of the other moves. The probability the token ends at a point on the graph of $|y|=|x|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ , where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$ .

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to find the probability that after six moves, the token ends up on the graph of |y| = |x|. Each move is 1 unit in one of the four directions: up, down, left, or right. Each move is equally likely, so the probability of each direction is 1/4. 

First, let me understand what the graph |y| = |x| means. It's the set of all points where the absolute value of y is equal to the absolute value of x. So, that's the two lines y = x and y = -x. So, the token needs to end up on either of these two lines. 

Given that the token starts at (0,0), after each move, the position changes by 1 in either the x or y direction. After six moves, the possible positions the token can be are points (a, b) where the total number of steps is six. Specifically, the x-coordinate is the number of right steps minus left steps, and the y-coordinate is the number of up steps minus down steps. Each step is either right, left, up, or down. 

So, to model this, let's say that each move can be in one of the four directions: right (R), left (L), up (U), or down (D). Each direction has a probability of 1/4. After six moves, the final position (x, y) can be represented by the number of right and left steps determining x, and the number of up and down steps determining y. 

But wait, each step is 1 unit, so x is equal to (number of R steps - number of L steps), and y is equal to (number of U steps - number of D steps). 

Moreover, since there are six moves in total, the total steps in the x-direction (R and L) plus the total steps in the y-direction (U and D) equal six. 

So, for a given final position (x, y), let’s say that the number of R steps is right, L steps is left, U steps is up, D steps is down. Then:

x = right - left
y = up - down
right + left + up + down = 6

But since we need the token to end up on |y| = |x|, which implies |x| = |y|. Therefore, |x| = |y|, which means that either x = y, x = -y, y = x, or y = -x. So, all four combinations. 

So, coordinates where the absolute values of x and y are equal. So, positions like (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), (2,2), (2,-2), etc., but since it's after six moves, possible x and y values can range from -6 to 6, but with |x| + |y| even? Wait, no, actually, after six steps, displacement in x and y direction must satisfy that the total steps (number of R + L steps) is some even number if x is even or odd, similarly for y. Hmm.

Wait, no, the parity of |x| and |y| would depend on the number of steps in each direction. Since x = right - left, and y = up - down. Let’s note that if the total number of steps in the x-direction (i.e., right + left) is k, then x must have the same parity as k, since right - left ≡ right + left (mod 2) (because left is subtracted, but modulo 2, subtraction is the same as addition). So, x ≡ k mod 2, and similarly y ≡ m mod 2, where m is the number of steps in the y-direction. 

But since the total number of steps is six, k + m = 6. Therefore, the parities of k and m must be the same because their sum is 6, which is even. Therefore, k and m are both even or both odd. If k is even, then x is even, and k is even, m is even, so y is even. Similarly, if k is odd, then x is odd, and m is odd, so y is odd. Therefore, x and y must have the same parity. However, in our problem, when |x| = |y|, that means that |x| and |y| are equal. Therefore, not only do they have the same parity, but also their absolute values are equal. 

So, possible positions where |x| = |y|. So, points like (0,0): |0| = |0|, which is trivial. Then (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), (2,2), etc., up to (6,6), but since six moves, the maximum displacement in either x or y direction is 6. However, since moving 6 steps in, say, the x-direction would require all six steps to be right or left, but then the y-coordinate would be 0, which cannot have |y| = |x| unless x is also 0. But (0,0) is already accounted for. Wait, no: if all six moves are in the x-direction (right and left), then x can be from -6 to 6 in even steps, and y=0. However, unless x is 0, y=0, then |x| = |0| only if x=0. So, displacement purely in x or y direction only can satisfy |x| = |y| if x or y is zero. Therefore, another point is (0,0), where the displacement is zero. Wait, but that's already covered. Hmm. 

Wait, but in general, after six moves, for the token to end on |y| = |x|, the token must be on a point where either both x and y are zero (but then the origin is already on |y| = |x|), but after even number of moves, but starting at (0,0). However, after six moves, can the token be back at (0,0)? Yes, but only if the number of right and left steps cancel out, and the number of up and down steps cancel out.

But in general, the condition |y| = |x| also includes points like (1,1), (-1,1), (2,2), etc. So, after six moves, we can end up at positions where |x| = |y|, so both coordinates have the same absolute value, but displacement from origin in both x and y directions. 

So, to find the probability, need to count all possible paths that end at such points and divide by the total number of possible paths, which is 4^6.

So, first step: calculate all end positions (a, b) where |a| = |b|, and count the number of paths leading to each such position, sum them up, and then divide by 4^6. 

Now, first step is to figure out all possible (a, b) where |a| = |b|, and the number of paths to each (a, b). Since moves are in four directions, each step is R, L, U, D. 

I need to note that the path can end up at (a, b) with k steps in x-direction and 6 - k steps in y-direction. For each (a, b) such that |a| = |b|, we can calculate the number of paths leading there. 

Alternatively, maybe use coordinate transformations. Since the problem is symmetric with respect to x and y, and also symmetric with respect to positive and negative axes, perhaps we can simplify the problem by considering non-negative coordinates and then multiplying by symmetry factors.

Alternatively, perhaps model this as a 2D random walk and compute the number of walks of length 6 that end on the line |x| = |y|. But I need to compute it step-by-step. Let's try.

First, observe that since |x| = |y|, then x = y, x = -y, y = x, y = -x, but actually, the possible points are those where |x| = |y|, so (k, k), (k, -k), (-k, k), (-k, -k) for integers k such that |k| + |k| <= 6? Wait, no. The total number of steps is 6, so |x| + |y| can be up to 6? No, because displacement in each direction is different. For example, moving 3 steps right and 3 steps left would result in x=0, but moving 3 steps right, 0 left, 3 steps up, 0 steps down would result in (3,3). So, total displacement |x| + |y| can be up to 6, but it can also be the case that |x| + |y| is less than or equal to 6. Wait: in two dimensions, the maximum displacement would be 6 in one direction, but if you spread the steps between x and y directions, you can get points where |x| + |y| <= 6. For example, moving 1 right and 1 left (net 0 x) and 4 up, resulting in (0,4). But 0 +4 =4. Wait, but the maximum |x| + |y| is 6? Because total steps are 6, but moving in both x and y.

Wait, |x| is the net number of steps in x-direction, so if, for example, the token moves 3 right and 3 up: x = 3, y = 3, so |x| + |y| =6. Similarly, 6 right and 0 up gives |x| + |y| =6. So, the maximum displacement |x| + |y| is 6. Therefore, points on |x|=|y| have |x| + |y| can be 0, 2, 4, or 6? Let me see:

For example:

- At (0,0): |0| + |0| = 0

- At (±1, ±1): |1| + |1| = 2

- At (±2, ±2): 4

- At (±3, ±3): 6

Similarly, other quadrants as well. So, the possible k in |x| = |y| =k can be 0,1,2,3.

Therefore, possible points are (0,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), (2,2), (2,-2), etc., up to (3,3), (3,-3), etc.

But with total displacement |x| + |y| equal to 0, 2, 4, or 6. So, possible k =0,1,2,3.

Hence, to compute the probability, we need to compute for each k=0,1,2,3 the number of paths ending at points (±k,±k), sum them up, and divide by 4^6.

So, first for k=0: (0,0). Let's compute the number of walks that end at (0,0) after six moves.

To end at (0,0), the number of right steps equals left steps, and the number of up steps equals down steps.

Let’s denote the number of right = left = r, and up = down = u.

Therefore, 2r + 2u =6 => r + u =3.

Possible values of r and u: r=0, u=3; r=1, u=2; r=2, u=1; r=3, u=0.

For each pair (r, u), the number of walks is [6! / (r! r! u! u!)] because the path consists of r right, r left, u up, u down. So, the multinomial coefficient.

Therefore, sum over r=0 to 3, u=3 - r: 

For r=0, u=3: 6!/(0!0!3!3!) = 6!/(3!3!) = 20.

For r=1, u=2: 6!/(1!1!2!2!) = 720 / (1*1*2*2) = 720 /4= 180.

For r=2, u=1: 6!/(2!2!1!1!) =720 / (2*2*1*1) =720/4=180.

For r=3, u=0:6!/(3!3!0!0!)=720/(6*6*1*1)=720/36=20.

Total number of paths to (0,0):20 + 180 + 180 + 20=400.

So, 400 paths end at (0,0).

Next, for k=1: the points (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1). Due to symmetry, each of these four points has the same number of paths. So, compute the number of paths to (1,1) and multiply by 4.

For (1,1): net right steps – left steps =1, so right - left =1.

Net up – down=1, so up - down=1.

Let’s let right = l, left = l -1? Wait, no. Wait, let's denote:

right - left =1 => right = left +1.

Similarly, up - down =1 => up = down +1.

The total steps: right + left + up + down =6.

Substitute right = left +1 and up = down +1:

(left +1) + left + (down +1) + down =6

2 left + 2 down +2=6

2(left + down)=4 => left + down=2.

Let left = a, then down=2 - a, where a can be 0,1,2.

Therefore, right = a +1, left= a, up= (2 - a) +1=3 - a, down=2 -a.

Therefore, the number of walks is, for each a:

6! / [ (a +1)! a! (3 - a)! (2 - a)! ) ]

So, let's compute for each a=0,1,2.

For a=0:

right=1, left=0, up=3, down=2.

Number of walks: 6!/(1!0!3!2!)=720 / (1*1*6*2)=720/12=60.

But wait, division by 0!? 0! is 1, right. So, 6!/(1!*0!*3!*2!) = 720 /(1*1*6*2)=60.

For a=1:

right=2, left=1, up=2, down=1.

Number of walks:6!/(2!1!2!1!)=720/(2*1*2*1)=720/4=180.

For a=2:

right=3, left=2, up=1, down=0.

Number of walks:6!/(3!2!1!0!)=720/(6*2*1*1)=720/12=60.

So total walks to (1,1): 60 + 180 +60=300.

Therefore, each of the four points (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1) has 300 paths, so total for k=1: 4*300=1200.

Wait, hold on. Wait, when I calculate (1,1), the number of paths is 300? Wait, no. Let me check again. Wait, for each a=0,1,2, we get 60 + 180 +60=300?

Wait no. Wait, the total number for a=0:60; a=1:180; a=2:60. I summed them to get 300, yeah.

Wait, but to get from (0,0) to (1,1) in six moves, with net displacement of (1,1). But the total steps must add up to six.

But for example, for a=0:

right=1, left=0, up=3, down=2. So, total steps:1+0+3+2=6.

Similarly, a=1:2 right, 1 left, 2 up,1 down: total steps:2+1+2+1=6. Correct.

a=2:3 right,2 left,1 up,0 down:3+2+1+0=6.

So, steps add up properly. Then, yes, the total number of paths is 60 + 180 +60=300.

However, does that make sense? Let's see: the total number of paths is 4^6=4096. The number of paths leading to (0,0) is 400, which is about 10%, which sounds plausible. 1200 paths for the four points at k=1, that's four points each with 300 paths. Then, 400 + 1200 =1600.

Moving on to k=2: points (2,2),(2,-2),(-2,2),(-2,-2). Similarly, for each point, let's compute the number of paths to (2,2), multiply by 4.

To compute paths to (2,2):

Net right - left=2, up - down=2.

So, right = left +2; up = down +2.

Total steps:right + left + up + down = (left +2) + left + (down +2) + down = 2 left +2 down +4=6.

Thus, 2 left +2 down =2 => left + down=1.

Therefore, left can be 0 or1, down accordingly 1 or0.

For left=0, down=1:

right=0 +2=2; up=1 + 2=3.

Number of walks:6!/(2!0!3!1!)=720/(2*1*6*1)=720/12=60.

For left=1, down=0:

right=1+2=3; up=0+2=2.

Number of walks:6!/(3!1!2!0!)=720/(6*1*2*1)=720/12=60.

So, total number of walks to (2,2):60 +60=120.

Therefore, each of the four points (2,2), (2,-2), etc., has 120 paths. So, total paths for k=2: 4*120=480.

Next, k=3: points (3,3), (3,-3), (-3,3), (-3,-3). Let’s compute paths to (3,3):

Net right - left=3; net up - down=3.

Therefore, right=left +3; up=down +3.

Total steps: (left +3) + left + (down +3) + down=2 left +2 down +6=6.

So, 2 left +2 down=0 => left + down=0. So, left=0 and down=0.

Thus, right=3, left=0; up=3, down=0.

So, number of walks is 6!/(3!0!3!0!)=720/(6*1*6*1)=720/36=20.

Therefore, each of the four points (3,3), (3,-3), etc., has 20 paths. So, total for k=3:4*20=80.

Therefore, summing up all the possibilities:

k=0: 400 paths.

k=1:1200 paths.

k=2:480 paths.

k=3:80 paths.

Total paths ending on |x|=|y|:400 +1200 +480 +80= 2160.

Wait, 400+1200 is 1600. 1600+480=2080. 2080+80=2160.

Then, the probability is 2160 divided by 4^6. 4^6 is 4096.

So, 2160/4096= Let's simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 2160÷16=135, 4096÷16=256.

So, 135/256. Check if 135 and 256 have common factors. 135 is 5×27, 256 is 2^8. So, coprime. Therefore, m=135, n=256. So, m +n= 135 +256= 391.

Wait, so the answer is 391. Hmm. But wait, let me check again because 391 is the sum if the probability is 135/256, but let me check whether calculations are correct.

First, checking for k=0: 20+180+180+20=400, that seems right.

For k=1: each point has 300, so four points x=4*300=1200.

For k=2: each point 120, four points 480.

For k=3: each point 20, four points 80.

Total paths:400+1200+480+80=2160.

Yes. Total paths:4^6=4096.

2160/4096= 135/256 as before.

So then the answer is 135+256=391.

But before finalizing, let me see if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe considering parity.

Alternatively, notice that in order to be on |x|=|y|, the token must have equal number of net steps in x and y directions. 

But since we have six steps, all steps being R, L, U, D.

Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions. Each step can be represented as (x + x^{-1} + y + y^{-1})^6, and then find the sum of the coefficients of terms where exponent of x and y (or x^{-1} and y^{-1}, etc.) have exponents with equal absolute values.

But that's perhaps similar to our approach.

But I think the initial calculation is correct. Let me think again.

For k=0:

Number of ways: [6!/((3 - r)! (3 - r)! r! r! ) summed over r? ] Wait, no.

Wait, for (0,0), you need equal right and left, equal up and down. But how many steps in x and y?

If we have right + left = 2r steps in x-direction, and up + down = 2u steps in y-direction, where 2r + 2u=6 steps.

So, total steps in x: 2r, in y:2u, with r + u =3. Earlier computed the number for each combination with a multinomial coefficient, summed to 400.

Similarly, for positions with |x|=1, |y|=1, to reach (1,1):

Number of paths. How many steps? To reach (1,1), we need the number of steps in x direction to be an odd number (since right - left =1), so steps in x direction (right + left) is 2r +1, and number of steps in x and y.

But for that, in general:

The approach we did before breaking into right = left +1 and up = down +1 and so on is accurate. Then the result per point was 300 for (1,1), with four such points, okay.

Similarly for (2,2), 120 paths per point, (3,3) with20 per point. Adding all. 2160 total, leading to 135/256.

Therefore, m and n are 135 and 256, which are coprime, since 135 is 5*3^3 and 256 is 2^8.

Indeed, no common factors, so m+n=135+256=391.

Therefore, the answer should be 391.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{391}

<text>Next, k=3: points (3,3), (3,-3), (-3,3), (-3,-3). Let's compute paths to (3,3):</text>
<explanation>The solver continues to apply symmetry recognition by identifying that all four points where |x| = |y| = 3 will have the same number of paths due to the symmetrical nature of the problem.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to transform mathematical expressions, equations, or formulas using operations like substitution, factoring, or simplification to reveal insights or solve for unknown quantities.</definition>

<start>5586</start>
<end>5837</end>
<text>The total steps: right + left + up + down =6.

Substitute right = left +1 and up = down +1:

(left +1) + left + (down +1) + down =6

2 left + 2 down +2=6

2(left + down)=4 => left + down=2.</text>
<explanation>The solver manipulates algebraic expressions by substituting the relationships between variables (right = left + 1 and up = down + 1) into the constraint equation for the total number of steps, and then simplifying to obtain a simpler equation (left + down = 2).</explanation>

<start>7037</start>
<end>7246</end>
<text>To compute paths to (2,2):

Net right - left=2, up - down=2.

So, right = left +2; up = down +2.

Total steps:right + left + up + down = (left +2) + left + (down +2) + down = 2 left +2 down +4=6.

Thus, 2 left +2 down =2 => left + down=1.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies algebraic manipulation to derive equations for the case k=2, substituting the relationships between variables (right = left + 2 and up = down + 2) into the constraint equation and simplifying to obtain left + down = 1.</explanation>

<skill>Numerical Computation</skill>
<definition>The ability to perform accurate arithmetic calculations, including operations with fractions, exponents, and other numerical expressions, often to determine final answers or intermediate values.</definition>

<start>4742</start>
<end>5106</end>
<text>Therefore, sum over r=0 to 3, u=3 - r: 

For r=0, u=3: 6!/(0!0!3!3!) = 6!/(3!3!) = 20.

For r=1, u=2: 6!/(1!1!2!2!) = 720 / (1*1*2*2) = 720 /4= 180.

For r=2, u=1: 6!/(2!2!1!1!) =720 / (2*2*1*1) =720/4=180.

For r=3, u=0:6!/(3!3!0!0!)=720/(6*6*1*1)=720/36=20.

Total number of paths to (0,0):20 + 180 + 180 + 20=400.</text>
<explanation>The solver performs detailed numerical calculations to determine the number of paths ending at (0,0), computing multinomial coefficients for each combination of r and u values and then summing the results.</explanation>

<start>8212</start>
<end>8467</end>
<text>Therefore, summing up all the possibilities:

k=0: 400 paths.

k=1:1200 paths.

k=2:480 paths.

k=3:80 paths.

Total paths ending on |x|=|y|:400 +1200 +480 +80= 2160.

Wait, 400+1200 is 1600. 1600+480=2080. 2080+80=2160.</text>
<explanation>The solver performs numerical calculations to determine the total number of paths ending on the lines |x| = |y|, adding up the number of paths for each value of k and double-checking the arithmetic.</explanation>

<skill>Fraction Simplification</skill>
<definition>The ability to reduce fractions to their simplest form by finding and dividing by the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator.</definition>

<start>8467</start>
<end>8673</end>
<text>Then, the probability is 2160 divided by 4^6. 4^6 is 4096.

So, 2160/4096= Let's simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 2160÷16=135, 4096÷16=256.

So, 135/256. Check if 135 and 256 have common factors. 135 is 5×27, 256 is 2^8. So, coprime.</text>
<explanation>The solver simplifies the fraction 2160/4096 by first dividing both numerator and denominator by 16 to get 135/256, and then verifying that 135 and 256 are coprime by factoring them (135 = 5×27 = 5×3^3 and 256 = 2^8).</explanation>

<skill>Self-Monitoring and Verification</skill>
<definition>The ability to check one's work, identify potential errors, and verify the correctness of intermediate steps and final solutions through alternative approaches or consistency checks.</definition>

<start>6101</start>
<end>6323</end>
<text>Wait, hold on. Wait, when I calculate (1,1), the number of paths is 300? Wait, no. Let me check again. Wait, for each a=0,1,2, we get 60 + 180 +60=300?

Wait no. Wait, the total number for a=0:60; a=1:180; a=2:60. I summed them to get 300, yeah.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates self-monitoring by questioning their calculation of the number of paths to (1,1), then rechecking the calculation and confirming that the sum is indeed 300.</explanation>

<start>6323</start>
<end>6609</end>
<text>Wait, but to get from (0,0) to (1,1) in six moves, with net displacement of (1,1). But the total steps must add up to six.

But for example, for a=0:

right=1, left=0, up=3, down=2. So, total steps:1+0+3+2=6.

Similarly, a=1:2 right, 1 left, 2 up,1 down: total steps:2+1+2+1=6. Correct.

a=2:3 right,2 left,1 up,0 down:3+2+1+0=6.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies the correctness of their approach by checking that for each combination of steps, the total number of steps adds up to six, confirming the consistency of their model.</explanation>

<start>8673</start>
<end>9003</end>
<text>Therefore, m=135, n=256. So, m +n= 135 +256= 391.

Wait, so the answer is 391. Hmm. But wait, let me check again because 391 is the sum if the probability is 135/256, but let me check whether calculations are correct.

First, checking for k=0: 20+180+180+20=400, that seems right.

For k=1: each point has 300, so four points x=4*300=1200.

For k=2: each point 120, four points 480.

For k=3: each point 20, four points 80.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates thorough self-monitoring by rechecking all of their calculations for each value of k before finalizing the answer, ensuring that the final result is correct.</explanation>
