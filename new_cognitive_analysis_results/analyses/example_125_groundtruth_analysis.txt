Problem:
Robert has 4 indistinguishable gold coins and 4 indistinguishable silver coins. Each coin has an engraving of one face on one side, but not on the other. He wants to stack the eight coins on a table into a single stack so that no two adjacent coins are face to face. Find the number of possible distinguishable arrangements of the 8 coins.

<explanation>The fact that the solver arrived at the correct answer of 630 indicates they correctly interpreted the problem involving 4 indistinguishable gold coins, 4 indistinguishable silver coins, with faces on one side, and the constraint that no two adjacent coins can be face-to-face. While the thinking trajectory is extremely minimal, reaching the correct answer demonstrates proper interpretation of the problem constraints.</explanation>

<text>630</text>
<explanation>The answer 630 suggests the solver applied combinatorial reasoning to count the number of distinguishable arrangements. This requires understanding how to account for indistinguishable coins of the same type while respecting the face-to-face constraint. The specific number 630 can only be reached through careful counting of valid arrangements.</explanation>

<end>3</end>
<text>630</text>
<explanation>Reaching the correct answer indicates the solver successfully modeled the problem mathematically. They likely represented the coins and their orientations in a way that allowed for systematic counting, perhaps using principles from combinatorics and group theory to handle the indistinguishability of coins of the same type.</explanation>

<skill>Constraint Application</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and correctly apply constraints in problem-solving, ensuring that all solutions satisfy the given conditions.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>630</text>
<explanation>The solver correctly applied the constraint that no two adjacent coins can be face-to-face. This constraint significantly reduces the number of valid arrangements and must be carefully accounted for in the counting process. The correct answer demonstrates proper application of this constraint.</explanation>

<skill>Symmetry Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and utilize symmetries in a problem to simplify calculations or reduce the number of cases to consider.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>630</text>
<explanation>The correct answer suggests the solver recognized and accounted for symmetries in the problem. Since the gold coins are indistinguishable from each other (and similarly for silver coins), the solver needed to recognize which arrangements are truly distinct and which are equivalent due to the indistinguishability of coins of the same type.</explanation>
