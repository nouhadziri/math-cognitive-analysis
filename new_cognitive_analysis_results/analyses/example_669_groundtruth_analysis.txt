Problem:
Dave arrives at an airport which has twelve gates arranged in a straight line with exactly $100$ feet between adjacent gates. His departure gate is assigned at random. After waiting at that gate, Dave is told the departure gate has been changed to a different gate, again at random. Let the probability that Dave walks $400$ feet or less to the new gate be a fraction $\frac{m}{n}$ , where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$ .

<explanation>The solver has represented the problem by identifying that the answer is 52, which suggests they've translated the problem about Dave walking between gates into a mathematical form with variables and relationships that yielded this numerical answer. Though the full work isn't shown, arriving at this specific value indicates they successfully represented the problem mathematically.</explanation>

<end>52</end>
<text>52</text>
<explanation>The problem involves calculating the probability that Dave walks 400 feet or less between randomly assigned gates. The solver's answer of 52 indicates they successfully applied probabilistic reasoning to determine the fraction m/n where m+n=52, showing they analyzed the random selection of gates and calculated the probability of the specified walking distance.</explanation>

<text>52</text>
<explanation>The problem requires understanding the spatial arrangement of twelve gates in a straight line with 100 feet between adjacent gates. The solver needed to visualize this linear arrangement to determine possible walking distances between gates, which was essential to calculating the probability of walking 400 feet or less.</explanation>

<text>52</text>
<explanation>The problem asks for the probability as a fraction m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. The solver's answer of 52 (representing m+n) indicates they successfully simplified the probability fraction to ensure m and n have no common factors, demonstrating fraction simplification skills.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver likely enumerated all possible combinations of initial and final gates (12Ã—11 = 132 total possibilities) and then counted how many of these combinations would result in Dave walking 400 feet or less. This counting of favorable outcomes among total possibilities is a key aspect of combinatorial analysis.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver modeled the airport gates as points on a line with uniform spacing, and Dave's movement as a distance calculation between two randomly selected points. This mathematical abstraction of the physical scenario was necessary to solve the probability problem.</explanation>
