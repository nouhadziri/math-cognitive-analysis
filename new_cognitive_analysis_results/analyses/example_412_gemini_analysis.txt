Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let G and H be two finite groups, and let $\varphi, \psi: G \to H$ be two surjective but non-injective homomorphisms. We want to prove that there exists an element $g \in G$ such that $g \neq e_G$ (the identity element of G) and $\varphi(g) = \psi(g)$.

Since $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are non-injective, there exist elements $g_1, g_2 \in G$ such that $g_1 \neq e_G$, $g_2 \neq e_G$, $\varphi(g_1) = e_H$ and $\psi(g_2) = e_H$. This is the definition of not being injective, the kernel is not just the identity. However, this does not directly imply that there exists an element with the same image under both homomorphisms.

Consider the map $f: G \to H \times H$ defined by $f(g) = (\varphi(g), \psi(g))$.
If there exists an element $g \neq e_G$ such that $\varphi(g) = \psi(g)$, this means that the two components of $f(g)$ are the same.

Consider the map $\theta: G \to H$ defined by $\theta(g) = \varphi(g) \psi(g)^{-1}$.
If there exists an element $g \neq e_G$ such that $\varphi(g) = \psi(g)$, then $\varphi(g) \psi(g)^{-1} = \varphi(g) \varphi(g)^{-1} = e_H$.
So, if there exists $g \neq e_G$ such that $\varphi(g) = \psi(g)$, then $g \in \ker(\theta)$.

Consider the set $K_\varphi = \ker(\varphi)$ and $K_\psi = \ker(\psi)$. Since $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are non-injective, $K_\varphi \neq \{e_G\}$ and $K_\psi \neq \{e_G\}$.
Let $g_1 \in K_\varphi$, $g_1 \neq e_G$, so $\varphi(g_1) = e_H$.
Let $g_2 \in K_\psi$, $g_2 \neq e_G$, so $\psi(g_2) = e_H$.

Consider the case when $\ker(\varphi) \cap \ker(\psi) \neq \{e_G\}$. If there exists an element $g \in \ker(\varphi) \cap \ker(\psi)$ such that $g \neq e_G$, then $\varphi(g) = e_H$ and $\psi(g) = e_H$, so $\varphi(g) = \psi(g)$. This solves the problem.

Now, consider the case when $\ker(\varphi) \cap \ker(\psi) = \{e_G\}$.
Since $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are surjective, $|H| = |G|/|\ker(\varphi)|$ and $|H| = |G|/|\ker(\psi)|$.
This implies that $|\ker(\varphi)| = |\ker(\psi)|$.

Consider the cardinality of the image of the map $\alpha: G \to H$ defined by $\alpha(g) = \varphi(g) \psi(g)^{-1}$.
We want to show that the kernel of this map is non-trivial.

Let's assume, for contradiction, that for all $g \in G$, if $\varphi(g) = \psi(g)$, then $g = e_G$.
Consider the map $f: G \to H \times H$ defined by $f(g) = (\varphi(g), \psi(g))$.
The size of the image of $f$ is $|Im(f)|$.
$|Im(f)| \le |H \times H| = |H|^2$.
The kernel of $f$ is $\{g \in G \mid \varphi(g) = e_H \text{ and } \psi(g) = e_H \} = \ker(\varphi) \cap \ker(\psi) = \{e_G\}$.
So $|Im(f)| = |G|/|\ker(f)| = |G|/1 = |G|$.
Thus $|G| \le |H|^2$.

Consider the number of elements such that $\varphi(g) = h$. This is the size of the coset $g \ker(\varphi)$, which is $|\ker(\varphi)|$.
Similarly, the number of elements such that $\psi(g) = h$ is $|\ker(\psi)|$.

Let's count the number of pairs $(g, g')$ in $G \times G$ such that $\varphi(g) = \psi(g')$.
For a fixed $g$, $\varphi(g) = h$. The number of $g'$ such that $\psi(g') = h$ is $|\ker(\psi)|$.
As $\varphi$ is surjective, for every $h \in H$, there exists some $g$ such that $\varphi(g) = h$.
The number of elements $g \in G$ such that $\varphi(g) = h$ is $|\ker(\varphi)|$.
So the number of pairs $(g, g')$ such that $\varphi(g) = \psi(g')$ is $\sum_{h \in H} |\{g \mid \varphi(g) = h\}| \times |\{g' \mid \psi(g') = h\}| = \sum_{h \in H} |\ker(\varphi)| \times |\ker(\psi)| = |H| |\ker(\varphi)| |\ker(\psi)| = |G| |\ker(\psi)|$.

Consider the set $S = \{(g, g') \in G \times G \mid \varphi(g) = \psi(g')\}$. We found $|S| = |G| |\ker(\psi)|$.
Consider the diagonal set $D = \{(g, g) \in G \times G \mid g \in G\}$. $|D| = |G|$.
Consider the intersection $S \cap D = \{(g, g) \in G \times G \mid \varphi(g) = \psi(g)\}$.
We are looking for an element in $S \cap D$ where $g \neq e_G$.

Let's count the number of elements $g \in G$ such that $\varphi(g) = \psi(g)$.
Consider the homomorphism $g \mapsto \varphi(g) \psi(g)^{-1}$. The kernel of this homomorphism are the elements we are looking for. If the kernel is not just the identity, we are done.

Assume that for all $g \neq e_G$, $\varphi(g) \neq \psi(g)$. This means that the only element $g$ for which $\varphi(g) = \psi(g)$ is $g = e_G$.
Consider the map $f: G \to H$ defined by $f(g) = \varphi(g) \psi(g)^{-1}$.
The kernel of $f$ is $\{g \in G \mid \varphi(g) \psi(g)^{-1} = e_H \} = \{g \in G \mid \varphi(g) = \psi(g) \} = \{e_G\}$.
By the first isomorphism theorem, $G / \ker(f) \cong Im(f)$, so $G / \{e_G\} \cong Im(f)$, which means $G \cong Im(f)$.
So $|Im(f)| = |G|$. This does not lead to a contradiction directly.

Consider the case where $H$ is abelian.
Consider the homomorphism $\varphi \psi^{-1}: G \to H$ defined by $(\varphi \psi^{-1})(g) = \varphi(g) \psi(g)^{-1}$.
The kernel of this homomorphism is $\{g \in G \mid \varphi(g) \psi(g)^{-1} = e_H \} = \{g \in G \mid \varphi(g) = \psi(g) \}$.
We are asked to prove that the kernel is non-trivial.

Consider the sizes of the kernels. $|\ker(\varphi)| > 1$ and $|\ker(\psi)| > 1$.
Let $|\ker(\varphi)| = n_1$ and $|\ker(\psi)| = n_2$.
$|H| = |G|/n_1 = |G|/n_2$, so $n_1 = n_2$.

Let $K_\varphi$ act on $G$ by left multiplication. The orbits have size $|K_\varphi|$.
Let $K_\psi$ act on $G$ by left multiplication. The orbits have size $|K_\psi|$.

Consider the elements of $H$. For each $h \in H$, there exists $|\ker(\varphi)|$ elements in $G$ that map to $h$ under $\varphi$, and $|\ker(\psi)|$ elements in $G$ that map to $h$ under $\psi$.

Let $X = \{ (g, g') \in G \times G \mid \varphi(g) = \psi(g') \}$. We counted $|X| = |G| |\ker(\psi)|$.
Consider the map $\mu: X \to H$ defined by $\mu(g, g') = \varphi(g) = \psi(g')$. This is surjective since $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are surjective.
Consider the map $\delta: G \to X$ defined by $\delta(g) = (g, g)$.
The image of $\delta$ is the set of elements we are interested in, where $\varphi(g) = \psi(g)$.

Consider the sets $\varphi^{-1}(h)$ and $\psi^{-1}(h)$ for each $h \in H$.
$|\varphi^{-1}(h)| = |\ker(\varphi)|$ and $|\psi^{-1}(h)| = |\ker(\psi)|$.
We are looking for an element in $\varphi^{-1}(h) \cap \psi^{-1}(h)$ for some $h \in H$, where the element is not the identity.

If for some $h \in H$, $|\varphi^{-1}(h) \cap \psi^{-1}(h)| > 1$, then there exists a non-identity element in the intersection.
$|\varphi^{-1}(h) \cup \psi^{-1}(h)| = |\varphi^{-1}(h)| + |\psi^{-1}(h)| - |\varphi^{-1}(h) \cap \psi^{-1}(h)|$.
The elements in $\varphi^{-1}(h)$ are of the form $g_0 k_1$ where $\varphi(g_0) = h$ and $k_1 \in \ker(\varphi)$.
The elements in $\psi^{-1}(h)$ are of the form $g'_0 k_2$ where $\psi(g'_0) = h$ and $k_2 \in \ker(\psi)$.

Consider the action of $G$ on $H \times H$ by $g \cdot (h_1, h_2) = (\varphi(g) h_1, \psi(g) h_2)$. This does not seem helpful.

Assume for contradiction that for every $g \in G \setminus \{e_G\}$, $\varphi(g) \neq \psi(g)$.
This means that the set $\{g \in G \mid \varphi(g) = \psi(g)\}$ contains only the identity element.

Consider the map $f: G \to H$ defined by $f(g) = \varphi(g) \psi(g)^{-1}$.
The kernel of $f$ is $\{g \in G \mid \varphi(g) = \psi(g)\} = \{e_G\}$.
By the first isomorphism theorem, $G / \{e_G\} \cong Im(f)$, so $|G| = |Im(f)|$.
This means that $f$ is injective.

If $H$ is abelian, then $f$ is a homomorphism.
If $H$ is not abelian, we cannot guarantee that $f$ is a homomorphism.

Consider the sets $\varphi(G) = H$ and $\psi(G) = H$.
Since $\varphi$ is not injective, $|\ker(\varphi)| > 1$. Let $g_1 \in \ker(\varphi)$ with $g_1 \neq e_G$, so $\varphi(g_1) = e_H$.
Since $\psi$ is not injective, $|\ker(\psi)| > 1$. Let $g_2 \in \ker(\psi)$ with $g_2 \neq e_G$, so $\psi(g_2) = e_H$.

If $\ker(\varphi) \cap \ker(\psi) \neq \{e_G\}$, then there exists $g \neq e_G$ in the intersection, so $\varphi(g) = e_H$ and $\psi(g) = e_H$, so $\varphi(g) = \psi(g)$.

Assume $\ker(\varphi) \cap \ker(\psi) = \{e_G\}$.
Consider the sizes of the fibers. $|\varphi^{-1}(h)| = |\ker(\varphi)|$, $|\psi^{-1}(h)| = |\ker(\psi)|$.
We are looking for an element in $\bigcup_{h \in H} (\varphi^{-1}(h) \cap \psi^{-1}(h))$ excluding the identity element.

Consider the set of pairs $\{(g, \varphi(g)) \mid g \in G \}$ and $\{(g, \psi(g)) \mid g \in G \}$ in $G \times H$.
We are looking for a $g \neq e_G$ such that $(\cdot, \varphi(g)) = (\cdot, \psi(g))$.

Consider the cardinalities of the inverse images.
For any $h \in H$, $|\varphi^{-1}(h)| = |K_\varphi|$ and $|\psi^{-1}(h)| = |K_\psi|$.
Since the homomorphisms are surjective, $|H| = |G|/|K_\varphi|$ and $|H| = |G|/|K_\psi|$, so $|K_\varphi| = |K_\psi|$. Let $k = |K_\varphi| = |K_\psi|$.

Consider the elements mapped to the identity. $\varphi(g) = e_H$ for $|K_\varphi|$ elements, $\psi(g) = e_H$ for $|K_\psi|$ elements.
Since the homomorphisms are non-injective, $|K_\varphi| > 1$ and $|K_\psi| > 1$.

Consider the union of the kernels. $|\ker(\varphi) \cup \ker(\psi)| = |\ker(\varphi)| + |\ker(\psi)| - |\ker(\varphi) \cap \ker(\psi)|$.
If $\ker(\varphi) \cap \ker(\psi) = \{e_G\}$, then $|\ker(\varphi) \cup \ker(\psi)| = |\ker(\varphi)| + |\ker(\psi)| - 1 = 2k - 1$.
The number of non-identity elements whose image is $e_H$ under either $\varphi$ or $\psi$ is $2k - 2$.

Let $S = \{ g \in G \setminus \{e_G\} \mid \varphi(g) = \psi(g) \}$. We want to show $S \neq \emptyset$.
Assume $S = \emptyset$. This means for all $g \neq e_G$, $\varphi(g) \neq \psi(g)$.

Consider the map $G \setminus \{e_G\} \to H$ given by $g \mapsto (\varphi(g), \psi(g))$.
The number of elements in $G \setminus \{e_G\}$ is $|G| - 1$.
The number of pairs in $H \times H$ is $|H|^2$.

Consider the mapping $g \mapsto (\varphi(g), \psi(g))$. If this mapping is injective on $G \setminus \{e_G\}$, then $|G| - 1 \le |H|^2$.

Consider the fibres $\varphi^{-1}(h)$ and $\psi^{-1}(h)$.
We are looking for a non-identity element in the intersection of some fibres.
$|\varphi^{-1}(h)| = k$, $|\psi^{-1}(h)| = k$.
If for some $h$, $|\varphi^{-1}(h) \cap \psi^{-1}(h)| \ge 2$, then there exists a non-identity element.

Consider the sum $\sum_{h \in H} |\varphi^{-1}(h) \cap \psi^{-1}(h)|$. This counts the number of elements $g \in G$ such that $\varphi(g) = \psi(g)$.
We know that $e_G$ is one such element. We need to show there is another.

We have $\sum_{h \in H} |\varphi^{-1}(h)| = |G|$ and $\sum_{h \in H} |\psi^{-1}(h)| = |G|$.
$\sum_{h \in H} |\varphi^{-1}(h)| = |H| k$.
Consider the sets $\varphi^{-1}(h)$ and $\psi^{-1}(h)$.
If $\varphi^{-1}(h) \cap \psi^{-1}(h) = \{g\}$, then $\varphi(g) = h$ and $\psi(g) = h$.

Consider the total number of elements in the sets $\varphi^{-1}(h)$ and $\psi^{-1}(h)$ combined over all $h \in H$.
$\sum_{h \in H} (|\varphi^{-1}(h)| + |\psi^{-1}(h)| - |\varphi^{-1}(h) \cap \psi^{-1}(h)|) = |G|$.
$\sum_{h \in H} |\varphi^{-1}(h)| + \sum_{h \in H} |\psi^{-1}(h)| - \sum_{h \in H} |\varphi^{-1}(h) \cap \psi^{-1}(h)| = |G|$.
$|G| + |G| - \sum_{h \in H} |\varphi^{-1}(h) \cap \psi^{-1}(h)| = |G|$.
$|G| = \sum_{h \in H} |\varphi^{-1}(h) \cap \psi^{-1}(h)|$.
The sum counts the number of elements $g \in G$ such that $\varphi(g) = \psi(g)$.
We know that $g = e_G$ is one such element.
If for all $g \neq e_G$, $\varphi(g) \neq \psi(g)$, then $|\varphi^{-1}(h) \cap \psi^{-1}(h)| = 1$ if $h = \varphi(e_G) = \psi(e_G) = e_H$, and $0$ otherwise. This is not correct.

The number of elements $g$ such that $\varphi(g) = \psi(g)$ is $\sum_{h \in H} |\{g \mid \varphi(g) = h \text{ and } \psi(g) = h \}| = \sum_{h \in H} |\varphi^{-1}(h) \cap \psi^{-1}(h)|$.
We found this sum is equal to $|G|$. This is incorrect.

Let $E = \{g \in G \mid \varphi(g) = \psi(g)\}$. We want to show $|E| > 1$.
Consider the map $f: G \to H \times H$, $f(g) = (\varphi(g), \psi(g))$.
$E = \{g \in G \mid f(g) = (\varphi(g), \varphi(g)) \}$.

Consider the sizes of the kernels. $|\ker(\varphi)| = |\ker(\psi)| = k > 1$.
Number of elements $g$ such that $\varphi(g) = h$ is $k$. Number of elements $g$ such that $\psi(g) = h$ is $k$.
Let $g_0$ be such that $\varphi(g_0) = h$. Then $\varphi^{-1}(h) = g_0 \ker(\varphi)$.
Let $g'_0$ be such that $\psi(g'_0) = h$. Then $\psi^{-1}(h) = g'_0 \ker(\psi)$.
We are looking for an element in $g_0 \ker(\varphi) \cap g'_0 \ker(\psi)$ other than the identity.
This means $g_0 k_1 = g'_0 k_2$ for some $k_1 \in \ker(\varphi)$, $k_2 \in \ker(\psi)$.

The number of solutions to $\varphi(g) = \psi(g)$ is $|\{g \in G \mid \varphi(g) \psi(g)^{-1} = e_H\}|$, which is the size of the kernel of the map $g \mapsto \varphi(g) \psi(g)^{-1}$. If $H$ is abelian, this is a homomorphism.

1. Case Analysis - The solver systematically breaks down the problem into distinct scenarios (whether the kernels' intersection is trivial or not) and analyzes each separately.

2. Mathematical Transformation - The solver introduces auxiliary constructs like θ(g) = φ(g)ψ(g)^(-1) that transform the original problem into equivalent forms that reveal new insights.

3. Set-Theoretic Reasoning - The solver applies principles of set theory to analyze relationships between kernels, preimages, and their cardinalities.

4. Algebraic Manipulation - The solver transforms complex expressions involving sums and cardinalities to derive key equations that advance the solution.

5. Self-Monitoring - The solver consistently evaluates progress, recognizes errors, and adjusts strategies when facing contradictions or unproductive paths.
