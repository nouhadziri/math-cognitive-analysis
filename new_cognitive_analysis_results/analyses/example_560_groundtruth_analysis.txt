Problem:
Let $S$ be the set of positive integer divisors of $20^9.$ Three numbers are chosen independently and at random with replacement from the set $S$ and labeled $a_1,a_2,$ and $a_3$ in the order they are chosen. The probability that both $a_1$ divides $a_2$ and $a_2$ divides $a_3$ is $\tfrac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m.$

<skill>Numerical Answer Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify that a solution consists solely of a numerical value without supporting work, requiring inference about the problem-solving process that led to this answer.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>2</end>
<text>77</text>
<explanation>The entire solution consists of just the number "77". This indicates the solver has determined this is the value of m in the probability fraction m/n. The brevity suggests the solver either worked through the problem mentally or on scratch paper, providing only the final answer without showing intermediate steps.</explanation>

<skill>Problem Decomposition</skill>
<definition>The ability to break down a complex problem into manageable components that can be solved individually.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>2</end>
<text>77</text>
<explanation>Though not explicitly shown, arriving at the answer "77" would have required decomposing the original problem into several steps: determining the divisors of 20^9, calculating the probability of the given condition, and expressing this as a reduced fraction to identify m. The correct answer suggests the solver successfully performed this decomposition.</explanation>

<skill>Number Theory Knowledge</skill>
<definition>Understanding and application of principles related to integer properties, divisibility, prime factorization, and related concepts.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>2</end>
<text>77</text>
<explanation>To arrive at 77 as the answer, the solver would have needed to work with the prime factorization of 20^9 = 2^9 Ã— 5^9, determine all possible divisors, and understand divisibility relationships among these numbers. The correct answer indicates proficiency with these number theory concepts.</explanation>

<skill>Probability Calculation</skill>
<definition>The ability to correctly determine the likelihood of events by identifying appropriate sample spaces and counting favorable outcomes.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>2</end>
<text>77</text>
<explanation>The problem asks for a probability expressed as m/n. Arriving at the answer "77" shows the solver correctly calculated this probability, which would have involved determining the total number of possible outcomes when selecting three numbers from the divisor set with replacement, and counting how many of these selections satisfy the divisibility conditions.</explanation>

<skill>Fraction Simplification</skill>
<definition>The ability to express a fraction in its simplest form by finding and dividing by the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>2</end>
<text>77</text>
<explanation>The problem specifies that m and n are relatively prime positive integers. The answer "77" indicates the solver found the probability as a fraction and reduced it to lowest terms to determine that m=77. This demonstrates the ability to express fractions in simplified form.</explanation>
