Problem:
Fisica and Ritmo discovered a piece of Notalium shaped like a rectangular box, and wanted to find its volume. To do so, Fisica measured its three dimensions using a ruler with infinite precision, multiplied the results and rounded the product to the nearest cubic centimeter, getting a result of 2017 cubic centimeters. Ritmo, on the other hand, measured each dimension to the nearest centimeter and multiplied the rounded measurements, getting a result of $V$ cubic centimeters. Find the positive difference between the least and greatest possible positive values for $V$.

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
It is not difficult to see that the maximum possible value of $V$ can be achieved when the dimensions are $(0.5+\epsilon) \times(0.5+\epsilon) \times\left(8070-\epsilon^{\prime}\right)=2017.5-\epsilon^{\prime \prime}$ for some very small reals $\epsilon, \epsilon^{\prime}, \epsilon^{\prime \prime}>0$, which when measured by Ritmo, gives $V=1 \cdot 1 \cdot 8070=8070$. Similarly, the minimum possible positive value of $V$ can be achieved when the dimensions are $(1.5-\epsilon) \times(1.5-\epsilon) \times\left(\frac{8066}{9}+\epsilon^{\prime}\right)=2016.5+\epsilon^{\prime \prime}$ for some very small reals $\epsilon, \epsilon^{\prime}, \epsilon^{\prime \prime}>0$, which when measured by Ritmo, gives $V=1 \cdot 1 \cdot 896=896$. Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum is $8070-896=7174$.
