Problem:
Compute the nearest integer to $$100 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 3^{n} \sin ^{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right)$$

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Note that we have $$\sin 3 x=3 \sin x-4 \sin ^{3} x \Longrightarrow \sin ^{3} x=\frac{1}{4}(3 \sin x-\sin 3 x)$$ which implies that $$\frac{\sin ^{3} x}{3 x}=\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{\sin x}{x}-\frac{\sin 3 x}{3 x}\right)$$ Substituting $x=\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}$ and simplifying gives us $$3^{n} \sin ^{3} \frac{\pi}{3^{n}}=\frac{3 \pi}{4}\left(\frac{\sin \frac{\pi}{3^{n}}}{\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}}-\frac{\sin \frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}}{\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}}\right)$$ Summing this from $n=1$ to $N$ and telescoping gives us $$\sum_{n=1}^{N} 3^{n} \sin ^{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right)=\frac{3 \pi}{4}\left(\frac{\sin \frac{\pi}{3^{N}}}{\frac{\pi}{3^{N}}}-\frac{\sin \pi}{\pi}\right)$$ Taking $N \rightarrow \infty$ gives us an answer of $$100 \cdot \frac{3 \pi}{4} \approx 236$$

# Analysis of Cognitive Skills

<skill>Mathematical Knowledge Retrieval</skill>
<definition>The ability to recall relevant mathematical formulas, identities, or theorems from memory that are applicable to the current problem.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>105</end>
<text>Note that we have $$\sin 3 x=3 \sin x-4 \sin ^{3} x \Longrightarrow \sin ^{3} x=\frac{1}{4}(3 \sin x-\sin 3 x)$$</text>
<explanation>The solver recalls the trigonometric identity for sin(3x) and then algebraically manipulates it to isolate sin³(x). This demonstrates knowledge retrieval of a non-trivial trigonometric identity that serves as the foundation for the solution approach.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to transform mathematical expressions through valid operations to obtain equivalent forms that are more useful for solving the problem at hand.</definition>

<start>0</start>
<end>105</end>
<text>Note that we have $$\sin 3 x=3 \sin x-4 \sin ^{3} x \Longrightarrow \sin ^{3} x=\frac{1}{4}(3 \sin x-\sin 3 x)$$</text>
<explanation>The solver rearranges the trigonometric identity to isolate sin³(x), which is the term that appears in the original problem. This manipulation transforms the identity into a more useful form for the specific problem.</explanation>

<start>106</start>
<end>193</end>
<text>which implies that $$\frac{\sin ^{3} x}{3 x}=\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{\sin x}{x}-\frac{\sin 3 x}{3 x}\right)$$</text>
<explanation>The solver further manipulates the expression by dividing both sides by 3x, creating a form that will facilitate the substitution and telescoping steps that follow. This shows strategic algebraic transformation to set up for later steps.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Substitution</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and apply appropriate variable substitutions that simplify a complex expression or reveal patterns that can be exploited.</definition>

<start>194</start>
<end>321</end>
<text>Substituting $x=\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}$ and simplifying gives us $$3^{n} \sin ^{3} \frac{\pi}{3^{n}}=\frac{3 \pi}{4}\left(\frac{\sin \frac{\pi}{3^{n}}}{\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}}-\frac{\sin \frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}}{\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}}\right)$$</text>
<explanation>The solver strategically substitutes x=π/3ⁿ, which directly relates to the terms in the original sum. This substitution transforms the expression into a form where the telescoping property becomes apparent. The solver also correctly handles how this substitution affects all parts of the equation.</explanation>

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify mathematical patterns, structures, or relationships that can be exploited to simplify calculations or solution approaches.</definition>

<start>322</start>
<end>462</end>
<text>Summing this from $n=1$ to $N$ and telescoping gives us $$\sum_{n=1}^{N} 3^{n} \sin ^{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right)=\frac{3 \pi}{4}\left(\frac{\sin \frac{\pi}{3^{N}}}{\frac{\pi}{3^{N}}}-\frac{\sin \pi}{\pi}\right)$$</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that the expression can be written as a telescoping series, where successive terms cancel out leaving only the first and last terms. This demonstrates the ability to identify a specific mathematical pattern (telescoping series) that dramatically simplifies the computation.</explanation>

<skill>Limit Evaluation</skill>
<definition>The ability to determine the value that a mathematical expression approaches as a variable approaches a specific value, particularly for infinite processes.</definition>

<start>463</start>
<end>544</end>
<text>Taking $N \rightarrow \infty$ gives us an answer of $$100 \cdot \frac{3 \pi}{4} \approx 236$$</text>
<explanation>The solver evaluates what happens to the expression as N approaches infinity. This involves recognizing that sin(π/3ᴺ)/(π/3ᴺ) approaches 1 as N approaches infinity (a well-known limit), and that sin(π)/π equals 0. The solver then completes the calculation by multiplying by 100 as required in the original problem.</explanation>

<skill>Numerical Approximation</skill>
<definition>The ability to convert exact mathematical expressions into approximate numerical values when appropriate.</definition>

<start>527</start>
<end>544</end>
<text>100 \cdot \frac{3 \pi}{4} \approx 236</text>
<explanation>The solver converts the exact expression 100·(3π/4) into the approximate numerical value 236, which is appropriate since the problem asks for the nearest integer. This demonstrates the ability to perform numerical calculations and round appropriately.</explanation>

<skill>Telescoping Series Application</skill>
<definition>The ability to recognize and apply the properties of telescoping series, where terms cancel out leaving only boundary terms, to simplify summations.</definition>

<start>322</start>
<end>462</end>
<text>Summing this from $n=1$ to $N$ and telescoping gives us $$\sum_{n=1}^{N} 3^{n} \sin ^{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right)=\frac{3 \pi}{4}\left(\frac{\sin \frac{\pi}{3^{N}}}{\frac{\pi}{3^{N}}}-\frac{\sin \pi}{\pi}\right)$$</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the telescoping series technique to simplify the summation. This involves recognizing that when the terms are summed, all intermediate terms cancel out, leaving only the difference between the first and last terms. This is a sophisticated technique that greatly simplifies the calculation.</explanation>
