Let  $P_{ij} (i,j \in 0,1,2,3)$  be the point determined by the equality:  $\overrightarrow{A_0P_{ij}} = \overrightarrow{A_iA_j}$ . Find the volume of the smallest convex polyhedron which contains all the points  $P_{ij}$ .

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
To find the volume of the smallest convex polyhedron containing all the points \( P_{ij} \), we first need to determine the coordinates of these points. Given the points \( A_0 = (0,0,0) \), \( A_1 = (1,0,0) \), \( A_2 = (0,1,0) \), and \( A_3 = (0,0,1) \), and the condition \( \overrightarrow{A_0P_{ij}} = \overrightarrow{A_iA_j} \), we can calculate the coordinates of \( P_{ij} \).

1. **Calculate the coordinates of \( P_{ij} \):**
   - For \( i = j \), \( \overrightarrow{A_0P_{ij}} = \overrightarrow{A_iA_j} = \overrightarrow{0} \), so \( P_{ij} = A_0 = (0,0,0) \).
   - For \( i \neq j \):
     - \( P_{01} = A_1 = (1,0,0) \)
     - \( P_{02} = A_2 = (0,1,0) \)
     - \( P_{03} = A_3 = (0,0,1) \)
     - \( P_{10} = A_0 - A_1 = (-1,0,0) \)
     - \( P_{12} = A_2 - A_1 = (-1,1,0) \)
     - \( P_{13} = A_3 - A_1 = (-1,0,1) \)
     - \( P_{20} = A_0 - A_2 = (0,-1,0) \)
     - \( P_{21} = A_1 - A_2 = (1,-1,0) \)
     - \( P_{23} = A_3 - A_2 = (0,-1,1) \)
     - \( P_{30} = A_0 - A_3 = (0,0,-1) \)
     - \( P_{31} = A_1 - A_3 = (1,0,-1) \)
     - \( P_{32} = A_2 - A_3 = (0,1,-1) \)

2. **List all unique points \( P_{ij} \):**
   \[
   \{(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (-1,0,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,-1), (-1,1,0), (-1,0,1), (1,-1,0), (0,-1,1), (1,0,-1), (0,1,-1)\}
   \]

3. **Identify the convex polyhedron:**
   By plotting these points, we observe that they form a convex polyhedron known as a cuboctahedron. This polyhedron can be visualized as a combination of a cube and an octahedron.

4. **Calculate the volume of the cuboctahedron:**
   The cuboctahedron can be decomposed into simpler shapes:
   - Two right tetrahedra with unit legs: Each tetrahedron has a volume of \(\frac{1}{6}\).
   - Six half-cubes: Each half-cube has a volume of \(\frac{1}{2}\).

   Therefore, the total volume \( V \) is:
   \[
   V = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 6 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{6} + 3 = \frac{1}{3} + 3 = \frac{10}{3}
   \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}\).
