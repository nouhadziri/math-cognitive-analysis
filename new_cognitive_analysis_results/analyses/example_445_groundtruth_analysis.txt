Problem:
Gases A and B are binary compounds consisting of three elements, two of which are in adjacent groups of the Periodic Table of Elements. Both gases can be burned in the air. The density of each of the gases relative to the density of argon at the same pressure and at the same temperature is equal to ~0.50 (error no more than 2%). Gas A dissolves well in water resulting in a solution with pH>7. Gas B is almost insoluble in water.
Write:
1) chemical equation of complete combustion of gas A;
2) chemical equation of complete combustion of gas B;

Indicate the range within which the sum of the molecular masses of the products of the reaction in equations 1) + 2) falls (taking into account the stoichiometric coefficients as whole numbers).
Answer Choices:
(A) from 260 to 280
(B) from 230 to 250
(C) from 170 to 190
(D) from 130 to 150

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
The atomic mass of argon = 39.948.
The density of each of the gases relative to the density of argon at the same pressure and at the same temperature is equal to ~0.50 (error no more than 2%), so 39.948*0.5 = 19.974.
Only the gases deuterated ammonia ND3 (Molecular weight = 20.049) and deuterated methane CD4 (Molecular weight = 20.067) meet the condition of the task. Other gases with the same molecular weight do not burn.
The task intentionally does not indicate that gases A and B can contain a heavier isotope of one of the elements since it should be a fairly significant clue even for a non-expert. For a chemist, the conditions/clues described in the task should be sufficient.
1) chemical equation of complete combustion of gas A:
4ND3 + 3O2 = 2N2 + 6D2O (M = 56 + 120 = 176)
2) chemical equation of complete combustion of gas B:
CD4 + 2O2 = CO2 + 2D2O (M = 44 + 40 = 84)
Total = 176 + 84 = 260 (falls within a range from 260 to 280)

<text>The atomic mass of argon = 39.948.
The density of each of the gases relative to the density of argon at the same pressure and at the same temperature is equal to ~0.50 (error no more than 2%), so 39.948*0.5 = 19.974.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies a key constraint from the problem statement regarding the density of gases A and B relative to argon.
