Problem:
Suppose the codeword that we use to describe a random variable X always starts with a symbol chosen from the set {7, 8, 9} , followed by binary digits {0, 1}. Thus we have a ternary code for the first symbol and binary thereafter. Give the optimal uniquely decodeable code (minimum expected number of symbols) for the probability distribution $p = (16/69, 15/69, 12/69, 10/69, 8/69, 8/69)$.

Domain: Probability theory

<explanation>The solver recognized the pattern required by the problem: that the codeword must start with a symbol from {7, 8, 9} followed by binary digits. This recognition is evident in how they structured their solution to include the initial ternary symbols (7, 8, 9) and then extended these with binary digits to form longer codes (70, 80, 90).</explanation>

<text>[7, 8, 9, 70, 80, 90]</text>
<explanation>The solver represented the problem by creating a list of potential codewords that follow the constraints given in the problem. They translated the verbal description of the code structure (ternary first symbol, binary thereafter) into actual code sequences that could be assigned to the random variable values.</explanation>

<skill>Constraint Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify, understand, and work within the constraints of a problem to find valid solutions.</definition>

<end>6</end>
<text>[7, 8, 9, 70, 80, 90]</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzed the constraints that the first symbol must be from {7, 8, 9} and subsequent symbols must be binary (0 or 1). They then created a set of codewords that strictly adheres to these constraints. The first three codewords use single digits from the ternary set, while the next three extend these with binary digits.</explanation>

<skill>Optimization Thinking</skill>
<definition>The ability to seek the most efficient or optimal solution according to specified criteria, often involving trade-offs.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>6</end>
<text>[7, 8, 9, 70, 80, 90]</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrated optimization thinking by creating a code that would minimize the expected number of symbols, as required by the problem. They assigned shorter codes (single digits 7, 8, 9) and longer codes (two-digit sequences 70, 80, 90) in a way that would likely correspond to the given probability distribution, with more frequent outcomes receiving shorter codes.</explanation>

<skill>Information Theory Application</skill>
<definition>The ability to apply principles from information theory, such as entropy, coding efficiency, and unique decodability to solve problems related to data compression and communication.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>6</end>
<text>[7, 8, 9, 70, 80, 90]</text>
<explanation>The solver applied principles of information theory by creating a prefix code (where no codeword is a prefix of another), which ensures unique decodability. They understood that an optimal code for minimizing expected code length would assign shorter codewords to more probable outcomes, following principles similar to Huffman coding but adapted to the specific constraints of this problem.</explanation>
