Problem:
Each lattice point with nonnegative coordinates is labeled with a nonnegative integer in such a way that the point $(0,0)$ is labeled by 0 , and for every $x, y \geq 0$, the set of numbers labeled on the points $(x, y),(x, y+1)$, and $(x+1, y)$ is \{n, n+1, n+2\} for some nonnegative integer $n$. Determine, with proof, all possible labels for the point $(2000,2024)$.

Domain: Combinatorics

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
We claim the answer is all multiples of 3 from 0 to $2000+2 \cdot 2024=6048$. First, we prove no other values are possible. Let $\ell(x, y)$ denote the label of cell $(x, y)$. \section*{The label is divisible by 3.} Observe that for any $x$ and $y, \ell(x, y), \ell(x, y+1)$, and \ell(x+1, y)$ are all distinct mod 3 . Thus, for any $a$ and $b, \ell(a+1, b+1)$ cannot match \ell(a+1, b)$ or \ell(a, b+1) \bmod 3$, so it must be equivalent to \ell(a, b)$ modulo 3 . Since \ell(a, b+1), \ell(a, b+2), \ell(a+1, b+1)$ are all distinct \bmod 3$, and \ell(a+1, b+1)$ and \ell(a, b)$ are equivalent \bmod 3$, then \ell(a, b), \ell(a, b+1), \ell(a, b+2)$ are all distinct \bmod 3$, and thus similarly \ell(a, b+$ $1), \ell(a, b+2), \ell(a, b+3)$ are all distinct \bmod 3$, which means that \ell(a, b+3)$ must be neither \ell(a, b+1)$ or \ell(a, b+2) \bmod 3$, and thus must be equal to \ell(a, b) \bmod 3$. These together imply that $$\ell(w, x) \equiv \ell(y, z) \bmod 3 \Longleftrightarrow w-x \equiv y-z \bmod 3$$ It follows that \ell(2000,2024)$ must be equivalent to \ell(0,0) \bmod 3$, which is a multiple of 3 . \section*{The label is at most 6048 .} Note that since \ell(x+1, y), \ell(x, y+1)$, and \ell(x, y)$ are 3 consecutive numbers, \ell(x+1, y)-\ell(x, y)$ and \ell(x, y+1)-\ell(x, y)$ are both \leq 2$. Moreover, since \ell(x+1, y+1) \leq \ell(x, y)+4$, since it is also the same mod 3 , it must be at most \ell(x, y)+3$. Thus, \ell(2000,2000) \leq \ell(0,0)+3 \cdot 2000$, and \ell(2000,2024) \leq \ell(2000,2000)+2 \cdot 24$, so \ell(2000,2024) \leq 6048$. \section*{Construction.} Consider lines \ell_{n}$ of the form $x+2 y=n$ (so $(2000,2024)$ lies on \ell_{6048}$ ). Then any three points of the form $(x, y),(x, y+1)$, and $(x+1, y)$ lie on three consecutive lines \ell_{n}, \ell_{n+1}, \ell_{n+2}$ in some order. Thus, for any $k$ which is a multiple of 3 , if we label every point on line \ell_{i}$ with \max (i \bmod 3, i-k)$, any three consecutive lines \ell_{n}, \ell_{n+1}, \ell_{n+2}$ will either be labelled 0,1 , and 2 in some order, or $n-k, n-k+1$, $n-k+2$, both of which consist of three consecutive numbers. Below is an example with $k=6$. \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 \\ \hline 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 \\ \hline 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 \\ \hline 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ \hline 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular} Any such labelling is valid, and letting $k$ range from 0 to 6048 , we see $(2000,2024)$ can take any label of the form $6048-k$, which spans all such multiples of 3 . Hence the possible labels are precisely the multiples of 3 from 0 to 6048.

<text>\section*{The label is at most 6048 .} Note that since \ell(x+1, y), \ell(x, y+1)$, and \ell(x, y)$ are 3 consecutive numbers, \ell(x+1, y)-\ell(x, y)$ and \ell(x, y+1)-\ell(x, y)$ are both \leq 2$. Moreover, since \ell(x+1, y+1) \leq \ell(x, y)+4$, since it is also the same mod 3 , it must be at most \ell(x, y)+3$. Thus, \ell(2000,2000) \leq \ell(0,0)+3 \cdot 2000$, and \ell(2000,2024) \leq \ell(2000,2000)+2 \cdot 24$, so \ell(2000,2024) \leq 6048$.</text>

<text>\section*{Construction.} Consider lines \ell_{n}$ of the form $x+2 y=n$ (so $(2000,2024)$ lies on \ell_{6048}$ ). Then any three points of the form $(x, y),(x, y+1)$, and $(x+1, y)$ lie on three consecutive lines \ell_{n}, \ell_{n+1}, \ell_{n+2}$ in some order. Thus, for any $k$ which is a multiple of 3 , if we label every point on line \ell_{i}$ with \max (i \bmod 3, i-k)$, any three consecutive lines \ell_{n}, \ell_{n+1}, \ell_{n+2}$ will either be labelled 0,1 , and 2 in some order, or $n-k, n-k+1$, $n-k+2$, both of which consist of three consecutive numbers. Below is an example with $k=6$. \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 \\ \hline 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 \\ \hline 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 \\ \hline 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ \hline 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular} Any such labelling is valid, and letting $k$ range from 0 to 6048 , we see $(2000,2024)$ can take any label of the form $6048-k$, which spans all such multiples of 3 . Hence the possible labels are precisely the multiples of 3 from 0 to 6048.</text>
<explanation>The solver explicitly constructs a family of valid labelings for the entire grid, showing that all multiples of 3 from 0 to 6048 can appear as the label for (2000,2024).
