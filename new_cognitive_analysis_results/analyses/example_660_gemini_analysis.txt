Problem:
Consider a three-person game involving the following three types of fair six-sided dice. - Dice of type $A$ have faces labelled $2,2,4,4,9,9$. - Dice of type $B$ have faces labelled $1,1,6,6,8,8$. - Dice of type $C$ have faces labelled $3,3,5,5,7,7$. All three players simultaneously choose a die (more than one person can choose the same type of die, and the players don't know one another's choices) and roll it. Then the score of a player $P$ is the number of players whose roll is less than $P$ 's roll (and hence is either 0,1 , or 2 ). Assuming all three players play optimally, what is the expected score of a particular player?

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the expected score of a particular player in a three-player game with three types of dice. The scoring rule is based on pairwise comparisons of the rolled values. The players choose their dice simultaneously and without knowing others' choices, suggesting a symmetric game. We need to find the Nash equilibrium of this game and then calculate the expected score under that equilibrium.

Let the three players be Player 1, Player 2, and Player 3. Let the choices of dice for the three players be $D_1, D_2, D_3$, where each $D_i \in \{A, B, C\}$. The rolls of the dice are random variables.

First, let's analyze the pairwise probabilities of one die rolling higher than another.

Die A: faces $2, 2, 4, 4, 9, 9$.
Die B: faces $1, 1, 6, 6, 8, 8$.
Die C: faces $3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7$.

Consider the probability $P(\text{Die } X > \text{Die } Y)$, where $X, Y \in \{A, B, C\}$.

$P(A > B)$:
Pairs of outcomes (A, B) where A's roll is greater than B's roll:
(2, 1), (2, 1) - 4 pairs
(4, 1), (4, 1) - 4 pairs
(9, 1), (9, 1) - 4 pairs
(4, 6), (4, 6) - 0 pairs
(4, 8), (4, 8) - 0 pairs
(9, 6), (9, 6) - 4 pairs
(9, 8), (9, 8) - 4 pairs

Total possible outcomes = $6 \times 6 = 36$.

Alternatively, we can consider the probabilities of each face:
$P(A=2) = 2/6 = 1/3, P(A=4) = 2/6 = 1/3, P(A=9) = 2/6 = 1/3$.
$P(B=1) = 2/6 = 1/3, P(B=6) = 2/6 = 1/3, P(B=8) = 2/6 = 1/3$.
$P(C=3) = 2/6 = 1/3, P(C=5) = 2/6 = 1/3, P(C=7) = 2/6 = 1/3$.

$P(A > B) = P(A=2)P(B=1) + P(A=4)P(B=1) + P(A=9)P(B=1)$
             $+ P(A=4)P(B=6) + P(A=9)P(B=6)$
             $+ P(A=9)P(B=8)$
             $= (1/3)(1/3) + (1/3)(1/3) + (1/3)(1/3)$
             $+ (1/3)(0) \times (1/3) \text{ incorrect}$

Let's use the outcomes approach:
Favorable outcomes for $A > B$:
A=2, B=1 (4 pairs)
A=4, B=1 (4 pairs)
A=9, B=1 (4 pairs)
A=9, B=6 (4 pairs)
A=9, B=8 (4 pairs)
Total favorable outcomes = $4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20$.
$P(A > B) = 20 / 36 = 5 / 9$.

$P(B > A) = 1 - P(A > B) - P(A = B)$.
Pairs where $A = B$: None.
$P(B > A) = 1 - 5/9 = 4/9$.

$P(A > C)$:
Favorable outcomes for $A > C$:
A=4, C=3 (4 pairs)
A=9, C=3 (4 pairs)
A=9, C=5 (4 pairs)
Total favorable outcomes = $4 + 4 + 4 = 12$.
$P(A > C) = 12 / 36 = 1 / 3$.

$P(C > A) = 1 - P(A > C) - P(A = C)$.
Pairs where $A = C$: None.
$P(C > A) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$.

$P(B > C)$:
Favorable outcomes for $B > C$:
B=6, C=3 (4 pairs)
B=6, C=5 (4 pairs)
B=8, C=3 (4 pairs)
B=8, C=5 (4 pairs)
B=8, C=7 (4 pairs)
Total favorable outcomes = $4 \times 5 = 20$.
$P(B > C) = 20 / 36 = 5 / 9$.

$P(C > B) = 1 - P(B > C) - P(B = C)$.
Pairs where $B = C$: None.
$P(C > B) = 1 - 5/9 = 4/9$.

Summary of pairwise probabilities:
$P(A > B) = 5/9, P(B > A) = 4/9$
$P(A > C) = 1/3, P(C > A) = 2/3$
$P(B > C) = 5/9, P(C > B) = 4/9$

Consider a game where two players choose between two dice, and the winner is the one with the higher roll. This is related to non-transitive dice.
Here, $P(A > B) > 1/2$, $P(C > A) > 1/2$, $P(B > C) > 1/2$.
This suggests a cycle $A > B > C > A$.

Now consider the three-player game. Each player chooses one of the three dice types. Let the strategies of the players be the probabilities of choosing each die type.
Let player $i$'s strategy be $(p_{iA}, p_{iB}, p_{iC})$, where $p_{iA} + p_{iB} + p_{iC} = 1$.

Consider a particular player, say Player 1. The score of Player 1 depends on the rolls of Player 2 and Player 3.
Score of Player 1 = number of players whose roll is less than Player 1's roll.

Let Player 1 choose die type $X$, Player 2 choose die type $Y$, Player 3 choose die type $Z$, where $X, Y, Z \in \{A, B, C\}$.

If Player 1 rolls $r_1$, Player 2 rolls $r_2$, Player 3 rolls $r_3$.
Score of Player 1 = $I(r_2 < r_1) + I(r_3 < r_1)$, where $I$ is the indicator function.

Expected score of Player 1, given the die choices $X, Y, Z$:
$E[\text{Score}_1 | X, Y, Z] = P(\text{Roll}_Y < \text{Roll}_X) + P(\text{Roll}_Z < \text{Roll}_X)$

If Player 1 chooses A, Player 2 chooses B, Player 3 chooses C:
$E[\text{Score}_1 | A, B, C] = P(B < A) + P(C < A) = P(A > B) + P(A > C) = 5/9 + 1/3 = 5/9 + 3/9 = 8/9$.

We need to find the Nash equilibrium of this game. Due to symmetry, we can assume all players use the same mixed strategy $(p_A, p_B, p_C)$.

Consider the expected payoff (score) for a particular player when they choose a specific die type, and the other two players use the mixed strategy.

Let the mixed strategy be $(p_A, p_B, p_C)$. Consider Player 1's expected score if they choose die A.
Player 2 chooses A with prob $p_A$, B with $p_B$, C with $p_C$.
Player 3 chooses A with prob $p_A$, B with $p_B$, C with $p_C$.

Expected score of Player 1 if they choose A:
$E[\text{Score}_1 | \text{Choice}_1 = A] = E[I(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_A) + I(\text{Roll}_3 < \text{Roll}_A)]$

Consider the contribution from Player 2:
$E[I(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_A)] = P(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_A)$
If Player 2 chooses A: $P(A < A) = 0$.
If Player 2 chooses B: $P(B < A) = P(A > B) = 5/9$.
If Player 2 chooses C: $P(C < A) = P(A > C) = 1/3$.

$P(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_A) = p_A P(A < A) + p_B P(B < A) + p_C P(C < A) = p_A(0) + p_B(5/9) + p_C(1/3)$.

Consider the contribution from Player 3:
$E[I(\text{Roll}_3 < \text{Roll}_A)] = P(\text{Roll}_3 < \text{Roll}_A) = p_A(0) + p_B(5/9) + p_C(1/3)$.

$E[\text{Score}_1 | \text{Choice}_1 = A] = 2 \times (p_B \cdot 5/9 + p_C \cdot 1/3) = 10/9 p_B + 2/3 p_C$.

Expected score of Player 1 if they choose B:
$E[\text{Score}_1 | \text{Choice}_1 = B] = E[I(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_B) + I(\text{Roll}_3 < \text{Roll}_B)]$
$P(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_B) = p_A P(A < B) + p_B P(B < B) + p_C P(C < B)$
                        $= p_A (4/9) + p_B (0) + p_C (4/9)$.

$E[\text{Score}_1 | \text{Choice}_1 = B] = 2 \times (4/9 p_A + 4/9 p_C) = 8/9 p_A + 8/9 p_C$.

Expected score of Player 1 if they choose C:
$E[\text{Score}_1 | \text{Choice}_1 = C] = E[I(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_C) + I(\text{Roll}_3 < \text{Roll}_C)]$
$P(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_C) = p_A P(A < C) + p_B P(B < C) + p_C P(C < C)$
                        $= p_A (2/3) + p_B (4/9) + p_C (0)$.

$E[\text{Score}_1 | \text{Choice}_1 = C] = 2 \times (2/3 p_A + 4/9 p_B) = 4/3 p_A + 8/9 p_B$.

In a symmetric Nash equilibrium, the expected score is the same for all choices of die type.
$10/9 p_B + 2/3 p_C = 8/9 p_A + 8/9 p_C = 4/3 p_A + 8/9 p_B$.

Equation 1: $10/9 p_B + 2/3 p_C = 8/9 p_A + 8/9 p_C$
$10 p_B + 6 p_C = 8 p_A + 8 p_C$
$10 p_B - 2 p_C = 8 p_A$
$5 p_B - p_C = 4 p_A$  (Eq 1')

Equation 2: $8/9 p_A + 8/9 p_C = 4/3 p_A + 8/9 p_B$
$8 p_A + 8 p_C = 12 p_A + 8 p_B$
$8 p_C = 4 p_A + 8 p_B$
$2 p_C = p_A + 2 p_B$  (Eq 2')

We also have $p_A + p_B + p_C = 1$.

Substitute $p_C = 1 - p_A - p_B$ into Eq 1':
$5 p_B - (1 - p_A - p_B) = 4 p_A$
$5 p_B - 1 + p_A + p_B = 4 p_A$
$6 p_B - 1 = 3 p_A$
$3 p_A = 6 p_B - 1$  (Eq 3)

Substitute $p_C = 1 - p_A - p_B$ into Eq 2':
$2 (1 - p_A - p_B) = p_A + 2 p_B$
$2 - 2 p_A - 2 p_B = p_A + 2 p_B$
$2 = 3 p_A + 4 p_B$  (Eq 4)

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables $p_A, p_B$:
$3 p_A - 6 p_B = -1$
$3 p_A + 4 p_B = 2$

Subtract the first equation from the second:
$(3 p_A + 4 p_B) - (3 p_A - 6 p_B) = 2 - (-1)$
$10 p_B = 3$
$p_B = 3/10$.

Substitute $p_B$ into $3 p_A + 4 p_B = 2$:
$3 p_A + 4 (3/10) = 2$
$3 p_A + 12/10 = 2$
$3 p_A + 6/5 = 2$
$3 p_A = 2 - 6/5 = 10/5 - 6/5 = 4/5$
$p_A = 4/15$.

Calculate $p_C$:
$p_C = 1 - p_A - p_B = 1 - 4/15 - 3/10 = 1 - 8/30 - 9/30 = 1 - 17/30 = 13/30$.

The symmetric Nash equilibrium strategy is $(p_A, p_B, p_C) = (4/15, 3/10, 13/30) = (8/30, 9/30, 13/30)$.
Check if the probabilities sum to 1: $8/30 + 9/30 + 13/30 = 30/30 = 1$.

Now calculate the expected score of a particular player under this equilibrium. We can use any of the expected score formulas derived earlier.
Expected score = $E[\text{Score}_1 | \text{Choice}_1 = A] = 10/9 p_B + 2/3 p_C$
$= 10/9 (3/10) + 2/3 (13/30) = 30/90 + 26/90 = 56/90 = 28/45$.

Let's verify with another formula:
Expected score = $E[\text{Score}_1 | \text{Choice}_1 = B] = 8/9 p_A + 8/9 p_C$
$= 8/9 (4/15) + 8/9 (13/30) = 32/135 + 104/270 = 64/270 + 104/270 = 168/270 = 84/135 = 28/45$.

Let's verify with the third formula:
Expected score = $E[\text{Score}_1 | \text{Choice}_1 = C] = 4/3 p_A + 8/9 p_B$
$= 4/3 (4/15) + 8/9 (3/10) = 16/45 + 24/90 = 32/90 + 24/90 = 56/90 = 28/45$.

The expected score of a particular player is $28/45$.

The question asks for the expected score of a particular player assuming all three players play optimally. This means we need to find the expected score under the Nash equilibrium.

Consider the symmetry of the game. The expected score of each player should be the same. Let the expected score of a player be $S$.
The sum of the scores of the three players is always $0 + 1 + 2 = 3$.
Expected sum of scores = $E[\text{Score}_1 + \text{Score}_2 + \text{Score}_3] = 3$.
By linearity of expectation, $E[\text{Score}_1] + E[\text{Score}_2] + E[\text{Score}_3] = 3$.
Since the equilibrium is symmetric, $E[\text{Score}_1] = E[\text{Score}_2] = E[\text{Score}_3] = S$.
$3 S = 3$, so $S = 1$.

Where is the mistake? The scores are defined relative to each player's roll.

Let's reconsider the score of Player 1.
Score of Player 1 = $I(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_1) + I(\text{Roll}_3 < \text{Roll}_1)$.
Expected score of Player 1 = $P(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_1) + P(\text{Roll}_3 < \text{Roll}_1)$.

Under the symmetric equilibrium, the probability that Player 2's roll is less than Player 1's roll is the same as the probability that Player 1's roll is greater than Player 2's roll.
$P(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_1) = P(\text{Choice}_1 > \text{Choice}_2)$, where the comparison is based on the pairwise probabilities of the chosen dice.

$P(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_1) = P(\text{Die}_2 < \text{Die}_1)$
$= p_A^2 P(A < A) + p_A p_B P(B < A) + p_A p_C P(C < A)$
$+ p_B p_A P(A < B) + p_B^2 P(B < B) + p_B p_C P(C < B)$
$+ p_C p_A P(A < C) + p_C p_B P(B < C) + p_C^2 P(C < C)$

$= p_A p_B (4/9) + p_A p_C (2/3) + p_B p_A (5/9) + p_B p_C (4/9) + p_C p_A (1/3) + p_C p_B (5/9)$
$= p_A p_B (4/9 + 5/9) + p_A p_C (2/3 + 1/3) + p_B p_C (4/9 + 5/9)$
$= p_A p_B (1) + p_A p_C (1) + p_B p_C (1)$
$= p_A p_B + p_A p_C + p_B p_C$.

$p_A = 4/15, p_B = 3/10, p_C = 13/30$.
$p_A p_B = (4/15)(3/10) = 12/150 = 2/25$.
$p_A p_C = (4/15)(13/30) = 52/450 = 26/225$.
$p_B p_C = (3/10)(13/30) = 39/300 = 13/100$.

$P(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_1) = 2/25 + 26/225 + 13/100 = 18/225 + 26/225 + 29.25/225$. Something is wrong.

Let's use the symmetry argument more carefully.
Consider two players choosing dice according to the equilibrium strategy.
Probability that Player 1's roll is greater than Player 2's roll.
$P(\text{Roll}_1 > \text{Roll}_2) = \sum_{X, Y \in \{A, B, C\}} P(\text{Choose } X) P(\text{Choose } Y) P(\text{Roll}_X > \text{Roll}_Y)$
$= p_A^2 P(A > A) + p_A p_B P(A > B) + p_A p_C P(A > C)$
$+ p_B p_A P(B > A) + p_B^2 P(B > B) + p_B p_C P(B > C)$
$+ p_C p_A P(C > A) + p_C p_B P(C > B) + p_C^2 P(C > C)$

$= p_A p_B (5/9) + p_A p_C (1/3) + p_B p_A (4/9) + p_B p_C (5/9) + p_C p_A (2/3) + p_C p_B (4/9)$
$= p_A p_B (5/9 + 4/9) + p_A p_C (1/3 + 2/3) + p_B p_C (5/9 + 4/9)$
$= p_A p_B (1) + p_A p_C (1) + p_B p_C (1)$.

So, $P(\text{Roll}_1 > \text{Roll}_2) = p_A p_B + p_A p_C + p_B p_C$.
Similarly, $P(\text{Roll}_1 < \text{Roll}_2) = p_A p_B + p_A p_C + p_B p_C$.
This cannot be true since they should sum to 1.

The probability that the two rolls are equal is zero.

Expected score of Player 1 = $P(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_1) + P(\text{Roll}_3 < \text{Roll}_1)$.
Due to symmetry, $P(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_1) = P(\text{Roll}_1 > \text{Roll}_2)$.

Consider the probability that Player 1 beats Player 2:
$p_A p_B P(A > B) + p_A p_C P(A > C) + p_B p_A P(B > A) + p_B p_C P(B > C) + p_C p_A P(C > A) + p_C p_B P(C > B)$
$= (4/15)(3/10)(5/9) + (4/15)(13/30)(1/3) + (3/10)(4/15)(4/9) + (3/10)(13/30)(5/9) + (13/30)(4/15)(2/3) + (13/30)(3/10)(4/9)$
$= 60/1350 + 52/1350 + 48/1350 + 195/2700 + 104/1350 + 156/2700$
$= (120 + 104 + 96 + 195 + 208 + 156) / 2700 = 879 / 2700$.

Expected score = $2 \times P(\text{Roll}_1 > \text{Roll}_2) = 2 \times (p_A p_B + p_A p_C + p_B p_C)$ if ties were possible.

$E[I(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_A)] = P(\text{Roll}_2 < \text{Roll}_A)$
If Player 2 chooses A: $P(A < A) = 0$.
If Player 2 chooses B: $P(B < A) = P(A > B) = 5/9$.
If Player 2 chooses C: $P(C < A) = P(A > C) = 1/3$.</text>
<explanation>The solver calculates the expected payoff for a specific strategy (choosing die A) against opponents playing mixed strategies, which is a key component of finding Nash equilibria in games.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to transform and solve algebraic equations and systems of equations through appropriate operations and substitutions.</definition>

<text>Equation 1: $10/9 p_B + 2/3 p_C = 8/9 p_A + 8/9 p_C$
$10 p_B + 6 p_C = 8 p_A + 8 p_C$
$10 p_B - 2 p_C = 8 p_A$
$5 p_B - p_C = 4 p_A$  (Eq 1')</text>
<explanation>The solver manipulates the equation by multiplying all terms by 9 to eliminate fractions, then rearranging terms to isolate variables, demonstrating algebraic manipulation skills.</explanation>

<start>6442</start>
<end>6639</end>
<text>Equation 2: $8/9 p_A + 8/9 p_C = 4/3 p_A + 8/9 p_B$
$8 p_A + 8 p_C = 12 p_A + 8 p_B$
$8 p_C = 4 p_A + 8 p_B$
$2 p_C = p_A + 2 p_B$  (Eq 2')</text>
<explanation>The solver continues to manipulate equations by multiplying by 9 to eliminate fractions and then isolating variables, showing systematic algebraic manipulation.</explanation>

<start>6675</start>
<end>6887</end>
<text>Substitute $p_C = 1 - p_A - p_B$ into Eq 1':
$5 p_B - (1 - p_A - p_B) = 4 p_A$
$5 p_B - 1 + p_A + p_B = 4 p_A$
$6 p_B - 1 = 3 p_A$
$3 p_A = 6 p_B - 1$  (Eq 3)</text>
<explanation>The solver uses substitution to eliminate a variable and simplify the system of equations, demonstrating knowledge of techniques for solving systems of equations.</explanation>

<start>7090</start>
<end>7297</end>
<text>Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables $p_A, p_B$:
$3 p_A - 6 p_B = -1$
$3 p_A + 4 p_B = 2$

Subtract the first equation from the second:
$(3 p_A + 4 p_B) - (3 p_A - 6 p_B) = 2 - (-1)$
$10 p_B = 3$
$p_B = 3/10$.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the elimination method to solve the system of equations, showing proficiency in algebraic techniques for solving linear systems.</explanation>

<skill>Self-Monitoring and Error Detection</skill>
<definition>The ability to critically evaluate one's own reasoning, identify potential errors or inconsistencies, and adjust the solution approach accordingly.</definition>

<start>1060</start>
<end>1211</end>
<text>$P(A > B) = P(A=2)P(B=1) + P(A=4)P(B=1) + P(A=9)P(B=1)$
             $+ P(A=4)P(B=6) + P(A=9)P(B=6)$
             $+ P(A=9)P(B=8)$
             $= (1/3)(1/3) + (1/3)(1/3) + (1/3)(1/3)$
             $+ (1/3)(0) \times (1/3) \text{ incorrect}$</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes an error in their calculation approach and explicitly marks it as incorrect, demonstrating self-monitoring and willingness to abandon an unproductive approach.</explanation>

<start>8511</start>
<end>8639</end>
<text>The question asks for the expected score of a particular player assuming all three players play optimally. This means we need to find the expected score under the Nash equilibrium.</text>
<explanation>The solver pauses to reflect on what the question is actually asking, ensuring their solution addresses the specific requirements of the problem.</explanation>

<start>8641</start>
<end>9062</end>
<text>Consider the symmetry of the game. The expected score of each player should be the same. Let the expected score of a player be $S$.
The sum of the scores of the three players is always $0 + 1 + 2 = 3$.
Expected sum of scores = $E[\text{Score}_1 + \text{Score}_2 + \text{Score}_3] = 3$.
By linearity of expectation, $E[\text{Score}_1] + E[\text{Score}_2] + E[\text{Score}_3] = 3$.
Since the equilibrium is symmetric, $E[\text{Score}_1] = E[\text{Score}_2] = E[\text{Score}_3] = S$.
$3 S = 3$, so $S = 1$.

Where is the mistake?</text>
<explanation>The solver obtains a result (S = 1) but immediately questions it by asking "Where is the mistake?", showing critical evaluation of their own reasoning and awareness that something might be wrong in their approach.</explanation>

<start>10021</start>
<end>10194</end>
<text>$P(\text{Roll}_1 > \text{Roll}_2) = p_A p_B + p_A p_C + p_B p_C$.
Similarly, $P(\text{Roll}_1 < \text{Roll}_2) = p_A p_B + p_A p_C + p_B p_C$.
This cannot be true since they should sum to 1.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies a logical inconsistency in their calculations (two probabilities that should be complements are equal), recognizing that this violates a basic probability principle and indicates an error in their reasoning.</explanation>
