Compute
\[\cos^6 0^\circ + \cos^6 1^\circ + \cos^6 2^\circ + \dots + \cos^6 90^\circ.\]

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Alright, so I have this problem to compute the sum of cos^6 from 0 degrees to 90 degrees. That is, I need to find:

\[\cos^6 0^\circ + \cos^6 1^\circ + \cos^6 2^\circ + \dots + \cos^6 90^\circ.\]

Hmm, okay. Let's think about how to approach this. 

First, integrating or summing trigonometric functions with powers can sometimes be tricky. But maybe there's a formula or identity that can simplify cos^6 theta into something manageable? I remember that for lower powers, like cos^2 or cos^3, there are standard identities. Let me recall... For cos^2 theta, the identity is: 

\[\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1 + \cos 2\theta}{2}.\]

And for higher powers, maybe we can use power-reduction formulas? For example, cos^4 theta can be expressed as a combination of multiple angles. Similarly, cos^6 theta can probably be expanded using multiple angle identities. Let me check how that works with cos^6 theta.

First, perhaps writing cos^6 theta as (cos^2 theta)^3. Then, substituting the power-reduction formula for cos^2 theta. So, continuing:

\[\cos^6 \theta = \left( \frac{1 + \cos 2\theta}{2} \right)^3.\]

Expanding this binomial expression might give us terms involving cos^3 2θ and lower powers. Hmm, but this would lead to higher order terms, cos 4θ and cos 6θ? 

Let me carry out the expansion. Let’s see:

First, cube the expression:

\[\left( \frac{1 + \cos 2\theta}{2} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}\left( 1 + 3\cos 2\theta + 3\cos^2 2\theta + \cos^3 2\theta \right).\]

Ah, right. So we get terms up to cos^3 2θ. That seems complicated, but we can again apply the power-reduction formulas to those higher power terms. So, let's handle each term step by step.

First, note that \(\cos^3 2\theta\) can be expressed using the identity:

\[\cos^3 x = \frac{3\cos x + \cos 3x}{4}.\]

Yes, the formula for cos^3 x. Let’s confirm that quickly:

Using the identity \(\cos^3 x = \frac{3\cos x + \cos 3x}{4}\), right. Because when you use De Moivre's theorem and expand cos^3 x, it combines the angles.

Similarly, the term with cos^2 2θ can be written using the power reduction formula again:

\[\cos^2 2\theta = \frac{1 + \cos 4\theta}{2}\]

Alright, substituting all these back into the expression.

Starting with:

\[\cos^6 \theta = \frac{1}{8}\left[ 1 + 3\cos 2\theta + 3\left( \frac{1 + \cos 4\theta}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{3\cos 2\theta + \cos 6\theta}{4} \right) \right].\]

Let me compute the coefficients term by term.

First term inside the bracket: 1

Second term: 3 cos2θ

Third term: 3*(1/2 + cos4θ/2) = 3/2 + (3/2) cos4θ

Fourth term: (3 cos2θ + cos6θ)/4 = (3/4) cos2θ + (1/4) cos6θ

Now adding all these together:

1 + 3cos2θ + 3/2 + (3/2) cos4θ + (3/4) cos2θ + (1/4) cos6θ

Combine like terms.

Constant terms:

1 + 3/2 = 5/2

cos2θ terms:

3cos2θ + (3/4) cos2θ = (12/4 + 3/4) cos2θ = (15/4) cos2θ

cos4θ terms:

(3/2) cos4θ

cos6θ terms:

(1/4) cos6θ

Hence, putting it all together:

\[\cos^6 \theta = \frac{1}{8} \left( \frac{5}{2} + \frac{15}{4} \cos 2\theta + \frac{3}{2} \cos4\theta + \frac{1}{4}\cos6\theta \right)\]

Simplify each term by multiplying through 1/8:

- 5/2 * 1/8 = 5/16

- 15/4 * 1/8 = 15/32

- 3/2 *1/8 = 3/16

- 1/4 *1/8 =1 /32

Thus:

\[\cos^6 \theta = \frac{5}{16} + \frac{15}{32} \cos 2\theta + \frac{3}{16} \cos4\theta + \frac{1}{32} \cos6\theta.\]

Great, so that should be the expansion for cos^6 theta. Let me double-check my algebra here.

Original expansion after stepping through each term led to:

5/2 + 15/4 cos2θ + 3/2 cos4θ + 1/4 cos6θ. Then multiplying each by 1/8:

Yes, 5/2 *1/8 = 5/16.

15/4 *1/8 =15/32, 3/2 *1/8=3/16, 1/4 *1/8=1/32.

Seems right. Okay, so now we can use this expansion for all angles from 0° to 90°, sum them up. So our original sum S is:

S = sum_{θ=0}^{90} cos^6 θ°

But given θ is in degrees. Trigonometric functions in degrees versus radians might complicate things, but perhaps we can proceed normally since we are dealing primarily with summations.

But, as we are going to sum from θ=0° to θ=90°, each term converted to radians is probably manageable.

Alternatively, maybe we can exploit the symmetric properties. Since we are summing from 0° to 90°, that is, 0 to π/2 in radians, sum will have certain symmetries.

But perhaps first, replace each cos^6 θ with the expression above:

\[\cos^6 \theta = \frac{5}{16} + \frac{15}{32} \cos 2\theta + \frac{3}{16} \cos4\theta + \frac{1}{32} \cos6\theta.\]

Thus,

\[\sum_{\theta=0}^{90} \cos^6 \theta = \sum_{\theta=0}^{90} \left( \frac{5}{16} + \frac{15}{32} \cos 2\theta + \frac{3}{16} \cos4\theta + \frac{1}{32} \cos6\theta \right )\]

Breaking the sum into four separate sums:

Sum1 = sum_{θ=0}^{90} 5/16

Sum2 = sum_{θ=0}^{90} 15/32 cos2θ

Sum3 = sum_{θ=0}^{90} 3/16 cos4θ

Sum4 = sum_{θ=0}^{90} 1/32 cos6θ

Therefore, S = Sum1 + Sum2 + Sum3 + Sum4

Compute each Sum.

Starting with Sum1:

Sum1 is 5/16 summed from θ=0 to θ=90. Since there are 91 terms (including both 0 and 90), Sum1 = 91*(5/16) = 455/16

Sum1 = 455/16 ≈ 28.4375, but fractionally, 455 divided by 16. 16*28=448, so 455-448=7, so 28 7/16.

Okay, Sum1 is straightforward.

Sum2: 15/32 sum_{θ=0}^{90} cos2θ°

Similarly, note that θ is in degrees. So the angles in the cosine functions are degrees as well. So, that's 2θ°, as θ ranges from 0° to 90°, so 2θ will range from 0° to 180°, stepping by 2°, but θ increasing by 1° each time. Wait, actually, θ is from 0° to 90°, so 2θ increases by 2° per step. However, in this sum, θ increases by 1°. Wait, no, the original sum is θ stepping each integer degree from 0 to 90. So 2θ would be 0°, 2°, 4°, ..., 180°, since theta goes up by 1°, then 2theta goes up by 2°, so angles 0, 2, 4, ..., 180 degrees.

Wait, but that's actually 91 terms as well, since θ from 0 to 90 inclusive. 90 - 0 + 1 = 91 terms.

But 2θ can be from 0° to 180°, theta each 1°. Wait, so the angles step by 2°, but when θ=0.0°,1°,2°,...,90°, so 2theta=0°,2°,4°,..., 180°. So when θ changes step of 1°, 2theta steps by 2°, hence 2theta from 0°,2°,...,180°.

Similarly for 4theta: theta steps of 1°, so 4theta =0°,4°,8°,...,360° (since 4*90=360)

Similarly, 6theta would be 0°,6°,12°,...,540°, but the actual angles repeat every 360°, so 540°=180°.

So for each of these sums (Sum2, Sum3, Sum4), we're being asked to compute the sum over multiple angles.

But the sum of coskθ, where theta ranges over an arithmetic sequence. Such sums are calculable using the formula for the sum of a cosine series.

In particular, the sum_{n=0}^{N-1} cos(a + nd) is ... but here, we need to check exact angles.

But maybe a better approach here is to note that when summing cosine terms over equidistant points on a unit circle, we can use known sum formulas.

Since the angles are symmetric in some way. However, 0° to 180°: for sum2, step of 2°, 91 terms? Wait, theta=0→90, which is 91 terms. So 2theta=0,2,...,180°, which is 91 terms as well.

Similarly for the sum3 sum_{theta=0}^{90}cos4theta°= sum_{k=0}^{90*4} step 4°, here, but theta increments 1°, which is different. Wait, perhaps I need to think of trigonometrical sum identities.

Wait, given that we must compute sum_{theta=0}^{90}cos(k theta). Normally, there's a formula for sum_{m=0}^{N-1} cos(a + m*d). For a general arithmetic progression in the angle, but here, seems like a specific case.

Alternatively, this sum is similar to a Riemann sum for an integral, but maybe over discrete angles? Unlikely—summing exact values. However, maybe using complex exponentials?

Let me recall that sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{i n φ} = (1 - e^{i N φ}) / (1 - e^{i φ})

But in that case, summing cosines can be considered as the real part of sum_{θ} e^{i k theta} where theta varies. But theta here is from 0° to 90°, stepping in 1° increments, and multiplied by a frequency k. So, for Sum2, k=2: sum_{theta=0}^{90}e^{i 2 theta°}

But 2 theta° increases by 2° each step. So, over a step of 1°, but when multiplied by k=2, actually the step between angles is k=2°, which is similar to a regular sum. Hmm, but actually, theta is from 0°, 1°, 2°, ..., 90°, so multiplied by k, they become 0°, 2°, 4°, ..., 180°, for k=2. So that becomes from 0° to 180° in 2° increments—similar to the way:

sum_{phi=0°}^{phi=180°, step 2°} cos(phi)

Therefore, sum_{phi=0°, step 2°}^{180°} cos phi.

Similarly, the number of terms here would be (180/2)+1=91 terms. Indeed, phi ranges over 0°, 2°, 4°, ..., 180°, giving 91 terms. Wait, but in reality, sum_{theta=0}^{90} cos(2 theta°). Which for theta=0 to 90 is exactly the same as phi=0 to 180 in steps of 2°, with phi=2 theta°, Therefore, 91 terms.

Similarly for Sum3: sum cos4 theta° = sum_{theta=0}^{90} cos(4 theta°). Here, 4 theta ranges from 0°,4°,8°,...,360°. Wait, theta goes to 90°, so 4*90=360°, so the angles run from 0° to 360° in 4° increments. So phi=0°,4°,8°,...,360°, so the number of terms here is 360/4 +1= 91 terms. Similarly, Sum4 is Sum theta=0->90 cos6theta°, which translates to phi(theta)=6 theta°, theta=0->90°, results in phi=0°,6°,12°,...,540°, but since cosine is periodic 360°, 540° is equivalent to 180°, So phi=0°,6°,12°,...,540°,which is equivalent to 0°,6°,12°,...,180°, but maybe overlapping. Wait...

Wait, 6 theta° for theta =0 to 90 increments of 1°, so phi take on 0°,6°,12°,..., 540°, but since cos(540°) = cos(180°),similarly cos(540 - 360)°=cos(180°), so each phi can be considered modulo 360°, but 540 - 360= 180, so equivalently, phi =0°,6°,12°..., 540° equivalent to 0°,6°,...,180°, etc. There may be overlapping angles here.

But perhaps this complicates things. Instead of converting phi angles, maybe we can compute the sum formula for cos.

But let me check for Sum2. So, Sum2 is 15/32 times the sum_{phi=0°}^{180° (step 2°)} cos phi.

Similarly, another identity for the sum of cosines as equidistant points:

It's known that the sum_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(a + kd) = [sin(n d / 2) / sin(d / 2)] * cos(a + (n-1)d/2)

So, here, in our case, for Sum2:

Angle increase is 2° per term (since theta increases 1°, so 2 theta increases 2°). Therefore, the sum is from 0°, 2°, ..., 180°, which is 91 terms (from 0 to 90 in original variable). So, the formula above gives:

sum_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(a + dk)

with n terms. In our case:

a=0°, d=2°, n=91.

Thus,

sum_{k=0}^{90} cos(0° + 2°k) = [sin(91 * 2° / 2) / sin(2° / 2)] * cos(0° + (91 -1)*2° /2 )

Simplify:

sin(91°) / sin(1°) * cos(90° * 1°)

Wait, hold on: sin(n*d/2)/sin(d/2)*cos(a + (n-1)*d/2)

Here, n=91, d=2°, a=0°, so:

sin(91*2°/2)/sin(2°/2) * cos(0 + (91 -1)*2°/2)

That becomes:

sin(91°)/sin(1°) * cos(90*1°) = sin(91°)/sin(1°) * cos(90°).

But cos(90°) is zero, so the whole product is zero. Therefore, Sum_{theta=0}^{90} cos(2 theta°) equals 0?

Wait, really?

Since capping at theta=90°, so 2 theta=180°, and the sum is from 0° to 180° by 2°, 91 terms, yes. According to the formula, sum equals [sin(91 *1°)/sin(1°)] * cos(90°).

But the formula might have off-by-one? Wait, n is the number of terms. If we have 0°,2°,..180°, that's (180 -0)/2 +1=91 terms, yes. So n=91.

Therefore:

sum_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(a + dk) = sum_{k=0}^{90} cos(0 + 2°k) = [sin(91*2°/2)/sin(2°/2)] * cos(0 + (91-1)*2°/2)

Which is [sin(91 * 1°)/sin(1°)] * cos(90° )

But sin(91°)/sin(1°) is a term,

But cos(90°)=0, so the entire sum is 0. Wait, wow! So Sum2=15/32*0=0 Similarly, maybe there is something here. Let me verify.

Because adding up these cosine terms, which are symmetric around 90°=pi/2. But let me check.

Wait, I think there might be a mistake here. Because sum_{k=0}^{90} cos(2k°). Alternatively, when you consider 2k° on the unit circle, the sum would be rotating vectors. But given that this is  points from 0°,2°,4°,...,180°. So sum of vectors on the upper semicircle?

Wait, but considering that sum of cosine's over symmetric angles. So 0°, 180°: cos 0° =1, cos 180°= -1. Similarly, angles around this... but average...

But here, over a span which is beyond pi. Wait, from 0° to 180°, with 91 points. However, in the identity we get that it's zero? Hmm.

Wait, if we actually compute:

Sum_{theta=0}^{90} cos(2 theta° )

But 91 terms:

Let me compute just a test:

Say theta=0: cos0=1

theta=1: cos2

theta=2: cos4

...

theta=90: cos180= -1

So, the terms are cos0°,cos2°, ..., cos180°, which sum like: 1 + cos2° + cos4° + ... + cos178° + (-1)

By pairing terms: 1 + (-1) at the ends, so the first and last term sum to 0. Then the remaining terms: cos2° + cos4° + ... + cos178°, that's (91-2)=89 terms, which can be grouped as (cos2° + cos178°)+ (cos4° + cos176°)+... Each pair sums to ? cos x + cos(180° -x) = cos x - cosx=0. Since cos(180° -x) = -cos x. Wait, Wait: hmm. Let's verify:

No, cos(180° - x) = -cos x.

Therefore, for example, cos2° + cos178° = cos2° + cos(180° - 2°)=cos2° - cos2°=0.

Similarly for cos4° + cos176°=0, etc. Therefore, each pair cancels. So sum after pairing is: 1 -1=0, then 0 for the remaining pairs. But how many terms? Let's see. 

Original series from theta=0(theta=0)→1, theta=1→cos2°, ..., theta=90→cos180°= -1.

Total coefficients: n=91.

If we arrange the terms as:

[1, cos2°, cos4°,..., cos178° , -1]

We pair cos2° with cos178°, which adds to zero; same for cos4°+cos176°=0,..., cos88° + cos92°=0. How many such pairs?

Each zero pair: starting from cos2° to cos178°, which is (178° -2°)/4 +1 steps?

Wait: theta increments by 0. So angles:

Minimum angle paired with maximum angle. So cosine2° pairs with cosine178°, which is angle(180° -2°=178°).

From theta =1 (gives cos2°) to theta=89 which gives cos178°, right? theta=1:2°, theta=89: 178°, but theta=90:180°.

So theta pairs are theta=1 and theta=89, theta=2 and theta=88,...up to theta=44 and theta=46°, theta=45 is in the middle?

Wait, since theta=0 gives 1, theta=90 gives -1. Then, theta=1:cos2°, theta=89:cos178°,... So total pairs from theta=1 to theta=89: which is 89 terms. Since step is1°.

Wait, theta=1 to theta=89:89 terms? No, theta=1,...,89 is 89 terms (as theta=0 and theta=90 are already considered). But wait, 2theta is from theta=0 (0°) up to theta=90 (180°). So when I pair theta=1 (2°) with theta=89 (178°), that's pairing of cos2° and cos178°, for example.

But how such pairing proceeds. The total number of such pairings is (90 -1)/2 pairs? Wait, theta=1 and theta=89; then theta=2 and theta=88, all the way to theta=44 and theta=46. There's middle term when N -1 is even? Wait, here, sum includes theta=0: 0°, theta=90:180°, and 89 terms in between. So from theta=1(2°) to theta=89(178°):

Number of angles between 2° and 178° is (178° - 2°)/2° +1= 88+1=89. So steps of angle=2°. But theta increases by1°, so phi=2 theta.

Therefore, this sum can be partitioned into sum=1 + (-1) + sum{theta=1→89} cos(2 theta°)

Then sum from theta=1 to 89 into pairs.

Term theta=1 and theta=89: pair (cos2° + cos178°)=0, next pair theta=2 and theta=88: (cos4° + cos176°)=0,... up to theta=44 and theta=46: (cos88° + cos92°)=0.

Number of paired terms: from theta=1 to theta=44 with their counterparts theta=89 to theta=46. So 44 pairs, each summing to zero.

Then theta=45 remains: cos90°=0. So theta=45, angle=90°, cos90°=0.

Hence the sum from theta=1 to 89 is 44 pairs each giving zero + 0 + theta=45 which is also zero? Wait, let's check:

Wait, tetha starts at 1 to 89, giving angle=2° to 178°. Stepsize of 2°, as per doubling.

Wait, phi from 2° to 178°, so 2°,4°,...,178°, which is 89 terms.

Wait, but 178° - 2° = 176°, number of step increments =176 /2 =88. So 88 +1=89 terms. Which aligns.

But how to pair them:

Pair first term with last term: tetha=1 and theta=89. As each step when paired with theta step and opposite theta step. But theta increments lead to phi of 2°,178°; for these 89 terms for the phi sum from 2° to 178°, which is symmetric around 90°, and each pair adds to zero except the middle term.

But 89 terms: odd number. So, the middle term is at (89+1)/2=45th term.

Yes.

So, the mid value would be phi=(89+1)/2)=45 phi terms: phi start at 2°, so 45th term is 2° + (44)*2°=90°, which is cos90°=0. So adding all of them:

This inner sum is the sum from phi=2° to phi=178°, step 2°: sum_{k=1}^{89}cos(2k°)= sum_{phi=2°, step2°}^{178°} cosphi.

Which is computed as:

Sum of pairs (2°+178°)+(4°+176°)+...+(88°+92°) +90°

Each of these pairs sums to cos phi + cos (180°-phi)=cosphi -cosphi=0. And the middle term cos90°=0. So total sum is zero. Hence, the entire inner terms gives zero, so sum from theta=0 to90 of cos2 theta°=1 + (-1) +0=0. That's clear. So Sum2 is 15/32 *0=0.

Similarly, Sum3 is3/16 sum_{theta=0}^{90}cos4 theta°, Sum4 =1/32 sum_{theta=0}^{90}cos6 theta°.

So, similarly to Sum2, we need to compute these two sums. Let's check Sum3. 

Sum3: sum_{theta=0}^{90} cos4 theta°, which is sum_{theta=0}^{90} cos(4 theta°). So the angles here start at 0°,4°,8°, . . .,4*90=360°. So from 0° to 360°, in steps of 4°, which yields (360 -0)/4 +1=91 terms.

Same number of terms as the original sum. Hence, sum_{k=0}^{90} cos(4* k°)= sum_{phi=0°}^{360° step 4°} cos phi.

Similar to before, using the same trigonometric identity. So applying the formula sum_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(a + dk) = [sin(n d /2)/sin(d /2)] * cos[a + (n -1) d /2]

Here, let's see for the sum:

sum_{theta=0}^{90} cos(4 theta°)= sum_{k=0}^{90} cos(4 k°) where theta goes from 0 to 90 (thus, phi=4 theta, angles reach 360°, step=4°). So here:

a=0°, d=4°, n=91. So, [sin(91*4°)/2 sin(2°)] * cos[0 + (91-1)*4°/ 2]

But wait, the formula actually gives:

sum_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(a + dk)= [sin(n d /2)/ sin(d/2) ] * cos(a + (n -1)d /2 )

Wait, the formula is correct. So in this case, parameters are:

a = 0°,

d =4°,

n=91,

So sum = [sin(91*4°/2)/sin(4°/2) ] * cos(0 + (91 -1) *4° /2 )

Compute each part:

n*d/2=91*4°/2=91*2°=182°

d/2=4°/2=2°,

Thus:

sum= [sin(182°)/sin(2°)] * cos( (90)*4° / 2 )

Wait, (91 -1)*4° /2= 90*4° /2=180°

So, cos(180°)= -1.

So sum= [sin(182°)/sin2°] * (-1 )

But sin(182°)= sin(180° +2°)= -sin2°, so you have -sin2°, so sum= ( -sin2° / sin2° )*(-1 )= (-1)*(-1)=1.

Thus, sum_{theta=0}^{90} cos4 theta°=1

Therefore, Sum3=3/16*1=3/16.

Interesting, that’s manageable.

Now onto Sum4: sum_{theta=0}^{90}cos6theta° = sum_{k=0}^{90} cos(6k°)

Here, theta from 0° to90°, phi=6theta from0° to540°, but since cosine is even and periodic with 360°, 6theta° mod360. So we get angles beyond 360°. So need to compute this sum.

Trying to use the same formula:

sum_{k=0}^{n -1} cos(a +dk)= [sin( n*d / 2 ) / sin( d / 2 ) ] * cos(a + (n-1)*d/2 )

So for Sum4:

a=0°, d=6°, n=91, which leads phi=0°,6°,12°,...,540°, 91 terms.

But 540°=360° + 180°, so angles can be mapped to phi=0°,6°,...,180°, but with overlaps. However, the formula applies as phi is defined modulo 360°, so even though angles greater than 360°, they can be considered as equivalent angles within 360°, making the full sum the same as sum_{k=0}^{90} cos6k°

But applying the standard formula:

sum= [sin(n*d /2) / sin(d/2)] * cos( a + (n -1)*d /2 )

For Sum4:

a=0°, d=6°, n=91.

Thus:

sin(n*d/2)=sin(91*6°/2)=sin(91*3°)=sin(273°)

d /2=3°, so sin(273°)/sin3°

cos( (n -1)*d / 2 )=cos(90*6°/2)=cos(270°)

Compute:

First, sin273°=sin(270°+3°)= -cos3°.

Because sin(270° + x )= sin270°cosx + cos270°sinx= -cosx , since sin270°=-1, cos270°=0.

Similarly,

So sin273°=sin(270° +3°)= -cos3≈°. Therefore,

sin273°/sin3°= -cos3°/sin3°= -cot3°

Then, cos270°=0, so:

Sum= [ -cot3° ] * 0=0.

Therefore, sum_{theta=0}^{90}cos6theta°=0.

Hence, Sum4=1/32*0=0.

So in total:

S = Sum1 + Sum2 +Sum3 + Sum4:

455/16 +0 +3/16 +0= (455 +3)/16= 458/16=229/8.

But that's 229 divided by8 is28.625.

But let me confirm:

SumTotal=455/16 +3/16= (455+3)/16=458/16=229/8 ≈28.625.

But let’s verify—if using theta=0°,90°, shouldn't cos^6 90°=0, since cos90°=0. The same with the term at theta=90°, so all terms from theta=0° to90°, including theta=90° which is zero. Hence, all values but initial steps fine.

But, wait. Wait. Hmm. Let's verify. For example, in the formula for cos^6 theta, when theta=90°, would the expression there equate zero?

Indeed, using the formula:

\[\cos^6 \theta = \frac{5}{16} + \frac{15}{32} \cos 2\theta + \frac{3}{16} \cos4\theta + \frac{1}{32} \cos6\theta.\]

At theta=90°:

cos^6 90°=0=5/16 + 15/32*(-1) + 3/16*(1) +1/32*(-1). Let's compute:

5/16=10/32

Then 15/32*(-1)= -15/32

3/16=6/32*1=6/32

1/32*(-1)= -1/32=> total is 10/32 -15/32 +6/32 -1/32=(10 -15+6 -1)/32=(0)/32=0. Which is correct.

Similarly, testing theta=0°:

cos0°=1, cos^60°=1. Formula:

5/16 +15/32*1 +3/16*1 +1/32*1 = (5/16 +15/32 +3/16 +1/32 )=

Convert to 32nds:

5/16=10/32, 15/32 stays,3/16=6/32,1/32 stays. Sum is10+15+6+1=32/32=1. Correct.

Thus, the formula works. Thus, summation being 229/8. Since the total number of terms is 91. Let's check if that makes sense.

But sum of cos^6 theta from 0° to90°=229/8. Which would be approximately28.625, which, considering each term is between 0 and 1 (except cos0=1, and cos90=0.), 91 terms each between0 and1. Sum would up to, But expecting sum>20 anyway.

Alternatively, maybe use a different approach? Let me try part actual numbers.

Take Sum1=91*(5/16)= 455/16≈28.4375. Sum3=3/16≈0.1875. So total ≈28.625, matches 229/8=28.625. So perhaps correct.

Alternatively, just find the answer through this method: it's 229 divided by8: 229 and8: 8*28=224,229−224=5, so289/8=28 5/8=28.625.

But since the problem requires an exact value, as a fraction. The answer is229/8.

But let me put units.

But double-check:

original expansion:

sum_{0}^{90} cos^6 theta= 5/16*91 +15/32 * sum(cos2 theta) + 3/16 * sum(cos4theta) +1/32 sum(cos6theta)= 5*91 /16 +15/32 *0 + 3/16*1 +1/32*0= (5*91)/16 +3/16= (455 +3)/16=458/16=229/8.

Convert to lowest terms:229 divided by8 is irreducible as it's already prime number (229 is a prime since 15^2=225, sqrt229≈15. So check divisors:2 divide? No. 3:2+2+9=13—13 not divisble by3. 5: ends with9—no. 7:229/7≈32.7 7*32=224, 229-224=5—no,11: 11*20=220, 229-220=9—no. 13:13*17=221, 229-221=8—no. So prime, 229.

So sum s=229/8.

Therefore, boxed result is boxed{  \dfrac{229}{8} }.

But wait! The summation goes from theta=0° to theta=90°, inclusive. With each value of theta integer degree.

Wait a sec, but in our trigonometric sum, we considered theta from 0° to90°, summing angles for cos2 theta°, which is up to180°, yes. The key steps  seems ok.

Just to make sure, confirming sum total as229/8.

Wait, thinking as verification, say for theta=45°. cos^6 45°= (sqrt(2)/2)^6= (2^(-1/2))^6=2^(-3)=1/8. So at theta=45°, the term is1/8. Adding these values along with others. But with sum total229/8≈28.625, i.e. each term contributes 0.31 on average... Huh, such sum? For theta=45°, it's1/8 (~0.125). When summing 91 terms, it's possible.

Considering cos theta from0° to90°, cos theta decreases to zero. The first term is1, then near 0. Well, but maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps to use a different formula in summation; since the angles are symmetric around 45°, considering properties of the sum.

I might be over complicating. However, considering my steps:

We used the expansion to convert cos^6 theta into linear combination of cos multiples angle, then sum each term using trig identity.

Given that the expansion for cos^6 theta was valid when theta=0° and theta=90°, as verified. Also the method Sum_{0}^{90}cosk theta equals zero for certain k (for k=2 and k=6 here we have summations over full circles or semicircles summing zeros)).

Hence, unless I have an error in deducing that sum cos4 theta°=1. But we saw in Sum3 that:

sum_{0}^{90}cos4theta°=1.

But let me verify this.

The formula, a=0°, d=4°, n=91, total.

Compute sum using the identity. N=91, d=4°. So:

sum= [sin(91*4° /2)/sin(4° /2)] * cos(a + (n-1)d /2).

= [ sin(182°)/sin(2°) ] * cos( (90*4°)/2 )

= [ sin(182°)/sin2° ] * cos(180° )

sin182= sin(180+2)= -sin2.

cos180= -1.

Thus:

[ -sin2° / sin2° ] *(-1)= (-1) * (-1)=1.

So yes, sumcos4 theta°=1.

Hence, that's correct. Sum3=3/16 *1=3/16.

Similarly sumcos6theta=0 as per above.

Therefore, the overall sum S=229⁄8.

Hence the boxed answer is \boxed{\dfrac{229}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{229}{8}}
