Problem:
Let  $R$  be an associative non-commutative ring and let  $n>2$  be a fixed natural number. Assume that  $x^n=x$  for all  $x\in R$ . Prove that  $xy^{n-1}=y^{n-1}x$  holds for all  $x,y\in R$ .

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. Let \( R \) be an associative non-commutative ring and let \( n > 2 \) be a fixed natural number. Assume that \( x^n = x \) for all \( x \in R \). We need to prove that \( xy^{n-1} = y^{n-1}x \) for all \( x, y \in R \).

2. First, observe that since \( x^n = x \) for all \( x \in R \), we can write:
   \[
   x^n = x \implies x^n - x = 0 \implies x(x^{n-1} - 1) = 0
   \]
   This implies that \( x \) is a root of the polynomial \( t^n - t \).

3. Consider the expression \( (xy^{n-1} - y^{n-1}x) \). We need to show that this expression is zero. To do this, we will use the given condition \( x^n = x \).

4. Let's compute \( (xy^{n-1} - y^{n-1}x)^2 \):
   \[
   (xy^{n-1} - y^{n-1}x)^2 = xy^{n-1}xy^{n-1} - xy^{n-1}y^{n-1}x - y^{n-1}xy^{n-1}x + y^{n-1}xy^{n-1}x
   \]
   Simplifying the terms, we get:
   \[
   (xy^{n-1} - y^{n-1}x)^2 = xy^{n-1}xy^{n-1} - xy^{n-1}y^{n-1}x
   \]
   Since \( y^{n-1} \) is an element of \( R \), and using the fact that \( x^n = x \), we can write:
   \[
   y^{n-1}y = y^n = y
   \]
   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   xy^{n-1}xy^{n-1} = xy^{n-1}y = xy
   \]
   and
   \[
   xy^{n-1}y^{n-1}x = xy^{n-1}x
   \]
   Thus, we get:
   \[
   (xy^{n-1} - y^{n-1}x)^2 = xy - xy^{n-1}x
   \]

5. Since \( R \) has no nontrivial nilpotents, the expression \( (xy^{n-1} - y^{n-1}x)^2 = 0 \) implies that:
   \[
   xy^{n-1} - y^{n-1}x = 0 \implies xy^{n-1} = y^{n-1}x
   \]

6. Therefore, we have shown that \( xy^{n-1} = y^{n-1}x \) for all \( x, y \in R \).

# Analysis of Cognitive Skills in the Mathematical Problem-Solving Trajectory

<skill>Problem Representation</skill>
<definition>The ability to understand and restate a mathematical problem in a way that makes its structure and requirements clear, often involving translation between verbal descriptions and symbolic mathematical notation.</definition>

<start>1</start>
<end>190</end>
<text>Let \( R \) be an associative non-commutative ring and let \( n > 2 \) be a fixed natural number. Assume that \( x^n = x \) for all \( x \in R \). We need to prove that \( xy^{n-1} = y^{n-1}x \) for all \( x, y \in R \).</text>
<explanation>The solver begins by clearly restating the problem, identifying the given conditions (associative non-commutative ring R, n > 2, x^n = x for all x ∈ R) and the goal (proving xy^(n-1) = y^(n-1)x for all x, y ∈ R). This representation establishes a clear framework for the subsequent solution process.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to transform and rearrange algebraic expressions according to valid mathematical rules to reveal new relationships or simplify expressions.</definition>

<start>192</start>
<end>357</end>
<text>First, observe that since \( x^n = x \) for all \( x \in R \), we can write:
   \[
   x^n = x \implies x^n - x = 0 \implies x(x^{n-1} - 1) = 0
   \]
   This implies that \( x \) is a root of the polynomial \( t^n - t \).</text>
<explanation>The solver manipulates the given condition x^n = x by subtracting x from both sides and then factoring to obtain x(x^(n-1) - 1) = 0. This algebraic transformation helps in understanding the structure of the problem by identifying that x is a root of the polynomial t^n - t.</explanation>

<start>479</start>
<end>738</end>
<text>\[
   (xy^{n-1} - y^{n-1}x)^2 = xy^{n-1}xy^{n-1} - xy^{n-1}y^{n-1}x - y^{n-1}xy^{n-1}x + y^{n-1}xy^{n-1}x
   \]
   Simplifying the terms, we get:
   \[
   (xy^{n-1} - y^{n-1}x)^2 = xy^{n-1}xy^{n-1} - xy^{n-1}y^{n-1}x
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver expands the square of the expression (xy^(n-1) - y^(n-1)x)^2 using algebraic rules for multiplying binomials, and then simplifies by canceling out identical terms with opposite signs. This demonstrates skilled algebraic manipulation to transform complex expressions into more manageable forms.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Approach Selection</skill>
<definition>The ability to choose an appropriate strategy or technique for solving a problem based on its structure and the given conditions.</definition>

<start>359</start>
<end>477</end>
<text>Consider the expression \( (xy^{n-1} - y^{n-1}x) \). We need to show that this expression is zero. To do this, we will use the given condition \( x^n = x \).</text>
<explanation>The solver strategically decides to focus on proving that the expression (xy^(n-1) - y^(n-1)x) equals zero, and specifically mentions using the given condition x^n = x to achieve this. This demonstrates the ability to select an appropriate approach based on the problem's structure and available information.</explanation>

<start>479</start>
<end>479</end>
<text>Let's compute \( (xy^{n-1} - y^{n-1}x)^2 \):</text>
<explanation>The solver makes a strategic decision to square the expression (xy^(n-1) - y^(n-1)x) rather than working with it directly. This choice reveals an understanding that examining the squared expression might lead to useful insights or simplifications, which is indeed what happens later in the solution.</explanation>

<skill>Application of Domain Knowledge</skill>
<definition>The ability to apply specific knowledge about mathematical concepts, theorems, and properties relevant to the problem domain.</definition>

<start>739</start>
<end>842</end>
<text>Since \( y^{n-1} \) is an element of \( R \), and using the fact that \( x^n = x \), we can write:
   \[
   y^{n-1}y = y^n = y
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver applies domain knowledge about rings and the given condition x^n = x to deduce that y^n = y, which is a key step in the solution. This demonstrates understanding of how to apply the given property to different elements in the ring.</explanation>

<start>1081</start>
<end>1219</end>
<text>Since \( R \) has no nontrivial nilpotents, the expression \( (xy^{n-1} - y^{n-1}x)^2 = 0 \) implies that:
   \[
   xy^{n-1} - y^{n-1}x = 0 \implies xy^{n-1} = y^{n-1}x
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver applies knowledge about nilpotent elements in rings to conclude that if the square of an element is zero, then the element itself must be zero. This application of domain-specific knowledge is crucial for completing the proof.</explanation>

<skill>Logical Inference</skill>
<definition>The ability to draw valid conclusions from given premises using rules of logical deduction.</definition>

<start>843</start>
<end>932</end>
<text>Therefore, we have:
   \[
   xy^{n-1}xy^{n-1} = xy^{n-1}y = xy
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver makes a logical inference by substituting y^(n-1)y = y into the expression xy^(n-1)xy^(n-1) to obtain xy^(n-1)y = xy. This demonstrates the ability to apply previously established facts to derive new relationships.</explanation>

<start>933</start>
<end>991</end>
<text>and
   \[
   xy^{n-1}y^{n-1}x = xy^{n-1}x
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver makes another logical inference, though there appears to be an error or missing step in the reasoning here. Nevertheless, this represents an attempt to apply logical reasoning to transform expressions based on established properties.</explanation>

<start>992</start>
<end>1080</end>
<text>Thus, we get:
   \[
   (xy^{n-1} - y^{n-1}x)^2 = xy - xy^{n-1}x
   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver draws a logical conclusion by substituting the simplified expressions back into the expanded form of (xy^(n-1) - y^(n-1)x)^2. This demonstrates the ability to maintain logical coherence throughout a multi-step derivation.</explanation>

<skill>Solution Verification</skill>
<definition>The ability to confirm that the derived result satisfies the requirements of the problem and addresses what was asked to be proven.</definition>

<start>1220</start>
<end>1292</end>
<text>Therefore, we have shown that \( xy^{n-1} = y^{n-1}x \) for all \( x, y \in R \).</text>
<explanation>The solver explicitly states that the required result (xy^(n-1) = y^(n-1)x for all x, y ∈ R) has been proven, verifying that the solution addresses what was asked in the problem statement.</explanation>
