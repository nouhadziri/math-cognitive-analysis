Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the ratio of the area of triangle $DEF$ to the area of triangle $ABC$. We are given the side lengths of triangle $ABC$ and the relative positions of points $D, E, F$ on the sides of the triangle.

The area of triangle $DEF$ can be found by subtracting the areas of triangles $ADF$, $BDE$, and $CEF$ from the area of triangle $ABC$.

Let the area of triangle $ABC$ be denoted by $[ABC]$.
$[DEF] = [ABC] - [ADF] - [BDE] - [CEF]$

We have $AD = p \cdot AB$, so $DB = (1-p) AB$.
$BE = q \cdot BC$, so $EC = (1-q) BC$.
$CF = r \cdot CA$, so $FA = (1-r) CA$.

The area of triangle $ADF$ can be expressed as:
$[ADF] = \frac{1}{2} AD \cdot AF \cdot \sin A = \frac{1}{2} (p \cdot AB) ((1-r) CA) \sin A$
We know that $[ABC] = \frac{1}{2} AB \cdot CA \cdot \sin A$.
So, $[ADF] = p(1-r) \cdot [ABC]$

Similarly,
$[BDE] = \frac{1}{2} BD \cdot BE \cdot \sin B = \frac{1}{2} ((1-p) AB) (q \cdot BC) \sin B$
$[ABC] = \frac{1}{2} AB \cdot BC \cdot \sin B$
So, $[BDE] = (1-p)q \cdot [ABC]$

And,
$[CEF] = \frac{1}{2} CE \cdot CF \cdot \sin C = \frac{1}{2} ((1-q) BC) (r \cdot CA) \sin C$
$[ABC] = \frac{1}{2} BC \cdot CA \cdot \sin C$
So, $[CEF] = (1-q)r \cdot [ABC]$

Now, substitute these into the expression for $[DEF]$:
$[DEF] = [ABC] - p(1-r)[ABC] - (1-p)q[ABC] - (1-q)r[ABC]$
$\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = 1 - p(1-r) - (1-p)q - (1-q)r$
$\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = 1 - (p - pr) - (q - pq) - (r - qr)$
$\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = 1 - p + pr - q + pq - r + qr$
$\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = 1 - (p+q+r) + (pq+qr+rp)$

We are given $p+q+r = 2/3$. We need to find the value of $pq+qr+rp$.

We are also given $p^2+q^2+r^2 = 2/5$.

Consider the identity $(p+q+r)^2 = p^2+q^2+r^2 + 2(pq+qr+rp)$.
$(2/3)^2 = 2/5 + 2(pq+qr+rp)$
$4/9 = 2/5 + 2(pq+qr+rp)$
$2(pq+qr+rp) = 4/9 - 2/5 = \frac{4 \cdot 5 - 2 \cdot 9}{9 \cdot 5} = \frac{20 - 18}{45} = \frac{2}{45}$
$pq+qr+rp = \frac{1}{45}$

Now, substitute the values of $p+q+r$ and $pq+qr+rp$ into the ratio formula:
$\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = 1 - (2/3) + (1/45)$
$\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = \frac{45}{45} - \frac{30}{45} + \frac{1}{45} = \frac{45 - 30 + 1}{45} = \frac{15 + 1}{45} = \frac{16}{45}$

The ratio of the area of triangle $DEF$ to the area of triangle $ABC$ is $16/45$.
This is in the form $m/n$, where $m=16$ and $n=45$.
We need to check if $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
Prime factors of 16 are 2, 2, 2, 2.
Prime factors of 45 are 3, 3, 5.
Since there are no common prime factors, 16 and 45 are relatively prime.

The problem asks for $m+n$.
$m+n = 16 + 45 = 61$.

The side lengths of triangle $ABC$ were given, but they were not used in the calculation of the ratio of the areas. This suggests that the ratio is independent of the specific shape of triangle $ABC$.

Let's double-check the calculations.

The formula for the ratio of areas is correct.
The use of the identity relating the sum of squares and the sum of pairwise products is also correct.

The calculation of $pq+qr+rp$:
$(p+q+r)^2 = p^2+q^2+r^2 + 2(pq+qr+rp)$
$(2/3)^2 = 4/9$
$p^2+q^2+r^2 = 2/5$
$4/9 = 2/5 + 2(pq+qr+rp)$
$2(pq+qr+rp) = 4/9 - 2/5 = (20 - 18)/45 = 2/45$
$pq+qr+rp = 1/45$  (Correct)

The calculation of the ratio of areas:
$\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = 1 - (p+q+r) + (pq+qr+rp)$
$\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = 1 - (2/3) + (1/45)$
$\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = \frac{45 - 30 + 1}{45} = \frac{16}{45}$ (Correct)

The values of $m$ and $n$:
$m = 16$
$n = 45$
$\gcd(16, 45) = \gcd(2^4, 3^2 \cdot 5) = 1$. So, they are relatively prime.

The value of $m+n$:
$m+n = 16 + 45 = 61$.

Consider an alternative approach using vectors or barycentric coordinates, but the current method seems straightforward and efficient.

Let's verify the conditions on $p, q, r$.
$p, q, r$ are positive.
$p+q+r = 2/3$
$p^2+q^2+r^2 = 2/5$

From $p+q+r = 2/3$, we know that $0 < p, q, r < 2/3$.

Consider the existence of such positive $p, q, r$.
We have $pq+qr+rp = 1/45$.

Consider the cubic polynomial with roots $p, q, r$:
$(x-p)(x-q)(x-r) = x^3 - (p+q+r)x^2 + (pq+qr+rp)x - pqr = 0$
$x^3 - (2/3)x^2 + (1/45)x - pqr = 0$

We need to ensure that $pqr$ can be chosen such that the roots are positive.

Consider the expression $(p+q+r)^2 = p^2+q^2+r^2 + 2(pq+qr+rp)$.
If $p, q, r$ are real, this identity holds.

Let's check the constraints on $p, q, r$ for a valid triangle configuration.
Since $D$ is on $\overline{AB}$, $0 < p \le 1$.
Since $E$ is on $\overline{BC}$, $0 < q \le 1$.
Since $F$ is on $\overline{CA}$, $0 < r \le 1$.

Given $p+q+r = 2/3$, since $p, q, r$ are positive, we have $0 < p, q, r < 2/3$.
This satisfies the conditions for the points to be on the segments.

The problem statement assumes the existence of such $p, q, r$.

Consider the case where the side lengths of triangle $ABC$ matter.
The formula for the area of triangle $DEF$ relies on the ratios $p, q, r$, which define the positions of $D, E, F$.

Ceva's Theorem: $\frac{AD}{DB} \cdot \frac{BE}{EC} \cdot \frac{CF}{FA} = 1$ for concurrent lines $AE, BF, CD$.
Here, the lines connecting vertices to the points on the opposite sides are not necessarily concurrent.

The ratio of the areas depends only on $p, q, r$.

Let's rethink the problem from the beginning to ensure no details are missed.
Triangle $ABC$ with sides $13, 15, 17$.
Points $D, E, F$ on the sides.
$AD = p \cdot AB$, $BE = q \cdot BC$, $CF = r \cdot CA$.
$p, q, r > 0$.
$p+q+r = 2/3$.
$p^2+q^2+r^2 = 2/5$.

We need the ratio $[DEF]/[ABC]$.

Using the formula derived:
$\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = 1 - (p+q+r) + (pq+qr+rp)$

We found $pq+qr+rp = 1/45$.

So, the ratio is indeed $1 - 2/3 + 1/45 = 16/45$.

The side lengths of triangle $ABC$ are used to calculate its area, but the ratio of areas cancels out this dependence.

Let's check the relative primality of $m=16$ and $n=45$.
Prime factors of $16 = 2^4$.
Prime factors of $45 = 3^2 \cdot 5$.
No common factors, so $\gcd(16, 45) = 1$.

The value of $m+n = 16 + 45 = 61$.

Consider potential pitfalls or alternative interpretations of the problem.
The problem statement is clear about the definitions of $p, q, r$ and the conditions they satisfy.
The ratio of areas formula is standard for this type of problem.

The values of $p, q, r$ themselves can be found, though it's not required.
Consider the cubic equation $x^3 - (2/3)x^2 + (1/45)x - pqr = 0$.
The roots are $p, q, r$.

We need $pqr > 0$ for positive roots.
Also, by AM-GM inequality, $\frac{p+q+r}{3} \ge \sqrt[3]{pqr}$.
$\frac{2/3}{3} \ge \sqrt[3]{pqr} \implies \frac{2}{9} \ge \sqrt[3]{pqr} \implies pqr \le (\frac{2}{9})^3 = \frac{8}{729}$.

Consider the discriminant of the cubic to ensure real roots, but we are given that such $p, q, r$ exist.

The problem seems designed to use the properties of $p, q, r$ without needing their exact values.

Double-check the algebra in the area ratio formula derivation.
$[ADF] = \frac{1}{2} AD \cdot AF \sin A = \frac{1}{2} (p AB) ((1-r) CA) \sin A = p(1-r) \cdot [ABC]$. (Correct)
$[BDE] = \frac{1}{2} BD \cdot BE \sin B = \frac{1}{2} ((1-p) AB) (q BC) \sin B = (1-p)q \cdot [ABC]$. (Correct)
$[CEF] = \frac{1}{2} CE \cdot CF \sin C = \frac{1}{2} ((1-q) BC) (r CA) \sin C = (1-q)r \cdot [ABC]$. (Correct)

$\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = 1 - p(1-r) - (1-p)q - (1-q)r$
$= 1 - (p - pr) - (q - pq) - (r - qr)$
$= 1 - p + pr - q + pq - r + qr$
$= 1 - (p+q+r) + (pq+qr+rp)$. (Correct)

The problem hinges on finding $pq+qr+rp$ from the given sums.
$(p+q+r)^2 = p^2+q^2+r^2 + 2(pq+qr+rp)$.
$(2/3)^2 = 4/9$.
$2/5 + 2(pq+qr+rp) = 4/9$.
$2(pq+qr+rp) = 4/9 - 2/5 = 20/45 - 18/45 = 2/45$.
$pq+qr+rp = 1/45$. (Confirmed)

The ratio is $\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = 1 - \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{45} = \frac{45 - 30 + 1}{45} = \frac{16}{45}$.

$m = 16$, $n = 45$.
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
$m+n = 16+45 = 61$.

The side lengths of triangle $ABC$ might be a distraction or a way to confirm that such a triangle exists.
Using Heron's formula, the area of triangle $ABC$ can be calculated if needed, but it cancels out in the ratio.
Semi-perimeter $s = (13+15+17)/2 = 45/2$.
Area $[ABC] = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{\frac{45}{2}(\frac{45}{2}-15)(\frac{45}{2}-17)(\frac{45}{2}-13)}$
$= \sqrt{\frac{45}{2}(\frac{15}{2})(\frac{11}{2})(\frac{19}{2})} = \sqrt{\frac{45 \cdot 15 \cdot 11 \cdot 19}{16}} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{141375}$
This calculation is not needed for the ratio.

The problem seems straightforward application of the area ratio formula. The main task is to correctly calculate $pq+qr+rp$.
The conditions on $p, q, r$ ensure that the points $D, E, F$ lie on the sides of the triangle.

Final verification of the calculations.
$p+q+r = 2/3$
$p^2+q^2+r^2 = 2/5$
$(p+q+r)^2 = p^2+q^2+r^2 + 2(pq+qr+rp)$
$(2/3)^2 = 4/9$
$4/9 = 2/5 + 2(pq+qr+rp)$
$2(pq+qr+rp) = 4/9 - 2/5 = 2/45$
$pq+qr+rp = 1/45$

Ratio $= 1 - (p+q+r) + (pq+qr+rp) = 1 - 2/3 + 1/45 = 16/45$.
$m=16$, $n=45$, relatively prime.
$m+n = 61$.
