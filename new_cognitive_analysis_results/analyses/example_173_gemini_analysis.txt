Problem:
Serge and Lis each have a machine that prints a digit from 1 to 6. Serge's machine prints the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6$ with probability $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}, p_{5}, p_{6}$, respectively. Lis's machine prints the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6$ with probability $q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, q_{4}, q_{5}, q_{6}$, respectively. Each of the machines prints one digit. Let $S(i)$ be the probability that the sum of the two digits printed is $i$. If $S(2)=S(12)=\frac{1}{2} S(7)$ and $S(7)>0$, prove that $p_{1}=p_{6}$ and $q_{1}=q_{6}$.

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks us to prove that $p_{1}=p_{6}$ and $q_{1}=q_{6}$ given certain conditions on the probabilities of the sum of the two digits printed by Serge's and Lis's machines.

Let $X$ be the digit printed by Serge's machine, and $Y$ be the digit printed by Lis's machine.
The possible values for $X$ and $Y$ are $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.
We are given the probabilities:
$P(X=i) = p_{i}$ for $i=1, \ldots, 6$
$P(Y=i) = q_{i}$ for $i=1, \ldots, 6$

We know that $\sum_{i=1}^{6} p_{i} = 1$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{6} q_{i} = 1$.

Let $Z = X + Y$ be the sum of the two digits printed. The possible values for $Z$ are $\{2, 3, \ldots, 12\}$.
We are given $S(i) = P(Z=i)$, the probability that the sum of the two digits is $i$.
$S(i) = P(X+Y=i) = \sum_{j=1}^{6} P(X=j, Y=i-j)$

Since the machines print independently, $P(X=j, Y=i-j) = P(X=j) P(Y=i-j) = p_{j} q_{i-j}$.
So, $S(i) = \sum_{j=1}^{6} p_{j} q_{i-j}$, where the terms are considered zero if the index is out of the range $[1, 6]$.

Let's write out the expressions for $S(2), S(7), S(12)$:
$S(2) = P(X+Y=2) = P(X=1, Y=1) = p_{1} q_{1}$

$S(7) = P(X+Y=7) = P(X=1, Y=6) + P(X=2, Y=5) + P(X=3, Y=4) + P(X=4, Y=3) + P(X=5, Y=2) + P(X=6, Y=1)$
$S(7) = p_{1} q_{6} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$

$S(12) = P(X+Y=12) = P(X=6, Y=6) = p_{6} q_{6}$

We are given the conditions:
1. $S(2) = S(12)$
2. $S(2) = \frac{1}{2} S(7)$
3. $S(7) > 0$

From condition 1, $p_{1} q_{1} = p_{6} q_{6}$.

From condition 2, $p_{1} q_{1} = \frac{1}{2} S(7)$.
This implies $2 p_{1} q_{1} = S(7) = p_{1} q_{6} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$.

Substituting $p_{1} q_{1} = p_{6} q_{6}$ into the equation from condition 2:
$2 p_{1} q_{1} = p_{1} q_{6} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$

Rearranging the terms:
$p_{1} q_{1} - p_{1} q_{6} - p_{6} q_{1} + p_{6} q_{6} = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} - p_{1} q_{1} + p_{6} q_{6}$
$p_{1} (q_{1} - q_{6}) - p_{6} (q_{1} - q_{6}) = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} - p_{1} q_{1} + p_{6} q_{6}$
$(p_{1} - p_{6}) (q_{1} - q_{6}) = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} - p_{1} q_{1} + p_{6} q_{6}$

Let's use the expression $2 p_{1} q_{1} = S(7)$:
$2 p_{1} q_{1} = p_{1} q_{6} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$

Consider the terms in $S(7)$. We can group them symmetrically:
$S(7) = (p_{1} q_{6} + p_{6} q_{1}) + (p_{2} q_{5} + p_{5} q_{2}) + (p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3})$

So, $2 p_{1} q_{1} = (p_{1} q_{6} + p_{6} q_{1}) + (p_{2} q_{5} + p_{5} q_{2}) + (p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3})$

We need to show that $p_{1} = p_{6}$ and $q_{1} = q_{6}$.

Consider the polynomial representation of the probabilities.
Let $P(x) = p_{1} x + p_{2} x^{2} + p_{3} x^{3} + p_{4} x^{4} + p_{5} x^{5} + p_{6} x^{6}$
Let $Q(x) = q_{1} x + q_{2} x^{2} + q_{3} x^{3} + q_{4} x^{4} + q_{5} x^{5} + q_{6} x^{6}$

The coefficient of $x^{k}$ in the product $P(x) Q(x)$ is given by $\sum_{i+j=k} p_{i} q_{j}$.
This is related to the probability of the sum, but not exactly the same.

Let's consider the generating functions for the distributions.
$G_{X}(t) = E[t^{X}] = p_{1} t^{1} + p_{2} t^{2} + \ldots + p_{6} t^{6}$
$G_{Y}(t) = E[t^{Y}] = q_{1} t^{1} + q_{2} t^{2} + \ldots + q_{6} t^{6}$

The generating function for the sum $Z = X+Y$ is $G_{Z}(t) = G_{X}(t) G_{Y}(t)$.
$G_{Z}(t) = (p_{1} t + p_{2} t^{2} + \ldots + p_{6} t^{6}) (q_{1} t + q_{2} t^{2} + \ldots + q_{6} t^{6})$

The coefficient of $t^{k}$ in $G_{Z}(t)$ is $P(Z=k) = S(k)$.
The terms in the product that give $t^{k}$ are from $p_{i} t^{i}$ and $q_{j} t^{j}$ where $i+j=k$.
Coefficient of $t^{k}$ in $G_{Z}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{6} p_{i} q_{k-i}$, where the indices are within $[1, 6]$.

Given $S(2) = S(12)$:
Coefficient of $t^{2}$ = Coefficient of $t^{12}$ in $G_{Z}(t)$.

Coefficient of $t^{2}$: $p_{1} q_{1}$
Coefficient of $t^{12}$: $p_{6} q_{6}$
So, $p_{1} q_{1} = p_{6} q_{6}$, which we already knew.

Given $S(2) = \frac{1}{2} S(7)$:
Coefficient of $t^{2}$ = $\frac{1}{2} \times$ Coefficient of $t^{7}$ in $G_{Z}(t)$.

Coefficient of $t^{7}$: $p_{1} q_{6} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$
So, $p_{1} q_{1} = \frac{1}{2} (p_{1} q_{6} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1})$
$2 p_{1} q_{1} = p_{1} q_{6} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$

Consider the symmetry of the problem. If $p_{1}=p_{6}$ and $q_{1}=q_{6}$, then
$S(2) = p_{1} q_{1}$
$S(12) = p_{6} q_{6} = p_{1} q_{1}$, so $S(2) = S(12)$.

$S(7) = p_{1} q_{6} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$
If $p_{1}=p_{6}$ and $q_{1}=q_{6}$, then
$S(7) = p_{1} q_{1} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{1} q_{1}$
$S(7) = 2 p_{1} q_{1} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2}$

We need to show the converse.

Let's consider the case where the distributions are uniform: $p_{i} = 1/6, q_{i} = 1/6$.
$S(2) = (1/6)(1/6) = 1/36$
$S(12) = (1/6)(1/6) = 1/36$
$S(7) = 6 \times (1/6)(1/6) = 6/36 = 1/6$
$S(2) = 1/36$, $S(12) = 1/36$, $S(7) = 1/6$.
$S(2) = S(12)$, $1/36 = 1/36$.
$\frac{1}{2} S(7) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{12}$.
$S(2) = 1/36 \neq 1/12 = \frac{1}{2} S(7)$.
So, uniform distributions do not satisfy the conditions.

Consider the expression $2 p_{1} q_{1} = p_{1} q_{6} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$.
Rearrange terms:
$p_{1} q_{1} - p_{1} q_{6} - p_{6} q_{1} + p_{6} q_{6} = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} - p_{1} q_{1} + p_{6} q_{6}$
$(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} - p_{1} q_{1} + p_{6} q_{6}$

We know $p_{1} q_{1} = p_{6} q_{6}$. Substitute this:
$(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} - p_{6} q_{6} + p_{1} q_{1}$
$(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2}$

Also, from $2 p_{1} q_{1} = S(7)$, we have:
$2 p_{1} q_{1} = p_{1} q_{6} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$

Consider the term $p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2}$.
From the equation above, $p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} = 2 p_{1} q_{1} - p_{1} q_{6} - p_{6} q_{1}$.

Substitute this back into the equation for $(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6})$:
$(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) = (2 p_{1} q_{1} - p_{1} q_{6} - p_{6} q_{1})$
$(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) = 2 p_{1} q_{1} - p_{1} q_{6} - p_{6} q_{1}$
$p_{1} q_{1} - p_{1} q_{6} - p_{6} q_{1} + p_{6} q_{6} = 2 p_{1} q_{1} - p_{1} q_{6} - p_{6} q_{1}$
$p_{6} q_{6} = p_{1} q_{1}$
This is consistent with the given condition $S(2) = S(12)$.

We have $S(7) > 0$. This means at least one of the terms in the sum for $S(7)$ is positive, which implies that for at least one pair $(i, 7-i)$, $p_{i} > 0$ and $q_{7-i} > 0$.

Consider the case where $p_{1} > p_{6}$.
If $q_{1} > q_{6}$, then $(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) > 0$.
If $q_{1} < q_{6}$, then $(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) < 0$.
If $q_{1} = q_{6}$, then $(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) = 0$.

Consider the expression $p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} \ge 0$.
If $(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) > 0$, then $p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} > 0$.

If $(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) < 0$, then $p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} < 0$, which is not possible since $p_i, q_i \ge 0$.

Therefore, we must have $(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) = 0$.
This implies either $p_{1} = p_{6}$ or $q_{1} = q_{6}$.

We need to show that both are true.

Assume, for contradiction, that $p_{1} \neq p_{6}$. Then $q_{1} = q_{6}$.
Substitute $q_{1} = q_{6}$ into the equation $2 p_{1} q_{1} = S(7)$:
$2 p_{1} q_{1} = p_{1} q_{1} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$
$p_{1} q_{1} = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$

If $q_{1} = q_{6}$, then the equation $(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2}$ becomes:
$0 = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2}$
Since all terms are non-negative, we must have $p_{2} q_{5} = 0, p_{3} q_{4} = 0, p_{4} q_{3} = 0, p_{5} q_{2} = 0$.

If $q_{1} = q_{6}$, then from $p_{1} q_{1} = p_{6} q_{6}$, we have $p_{1} q_{1} = p_{6} q_{1}$.
If $q_{1} > 0$, then $p_{1} = p_{6}$, contradiction.
If $q_{1} = 0$, then $q_{6} = 0$.

If $q_{1} = q_{6} = 0$, then from $p_{1} q_{1} = p_{6} q_{6}$, we have $0 = 0$, no info.
If $q_{1} = q_{6} = 0$, then the probabilities $q_i$ sum to 1, so at least one other $q_i > 0$.

Consider the case where $q_{1} = q_{6} = 0$.
$S(2) = p_{1} q_{1} = 0$
$S(12) = p_{6} q_{6} = 0$
$S(7) = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2}$

Given $S(2) = \frac{1}{2} S(7)$, so $0 = \frac{1}{2} S(7)$, which means $S(7) = 0$.
$p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} = 0$.
This implies $p_{2} q_{5} = 0, p_{3} q_{4} = 0, p_{4} q_{3} = 0, p_{5} q_{2} = 0$.

We are given $S(7) > 0$, so the case $q_{1} = q_{6} = 0$ is not possible.
Thus, if $q_{1} = q_{6}$, then $q_{1} > 0$.

Now, back to the implication of $(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) = 0$.
Either $p_{1} = p_{6}$ or $q_{1} = q_{6}$.

Assume $p_{1} \neq p_{6}$ and $q_{1} = q_{6}$.
From $2 p_{1} q_{1} = p_{1} q_{6} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$,
$2 p_{1} q_{1} = p_{1} q_{1} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$
$p_{1} q_{1} = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$

If $q_{1} > 0$, divide by $q_{1}$:
$p_{1} = p_{2} \frac{q_{5}}{q_{1}} + p_{3} \frac{q_{4}}{q_{1}} + p_{4} \frac{q_{3}}{q_{1}} + p_{5} \frac{q_{2}}{q_{1}} + p_{6}$
$p_{1} - p_{6} = p_{2} \frac{q_{5}}{q_{1}} + p_{3} \frac{q_{4}}{q_{1}} + p_{4} \frac{q_{3}}{q_{1}} + p_{5} \frac{q_{2}}{q_{1}}$

If $p_{1} > p_{6}$, then the RHS must be positive, which is true if any of $p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5$ are positive and corresponding $q_i$ are positive.
If $p_{1} < p_{6}$, then the RHS must be negative, which is not possible.

Consider the symmetry of the problem. The roles of $p_i$ and $q_i$ are somewhat interchangeable.
The conditions are symmetric with respect to $p$ and $q$.

If we assume $q_{1} \neq q_{6}$ and $p_{1} = p_{6}$, we get a similar contradiction.

Final check: If $p_{1}=p_{6}$ and $q_{1}=q_{6}$, then
$S(2) = p_{1} q_{1}$
$S(12) = p_{6} q_{6} = p_{1} q_{1}$, so $S(2) = S(12)$.
$S(7) = p_{1} q_{6} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$
$S(7) = p_{1} q_{1} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{1} q_{1}$
$S(7) = 2 p_{1} q_{1} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2}$
$\frac{1}{2} S(7) = p_{1} q_{1} + \frac{1}{2} (p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2})$
We need $\frac{1}{2} S(7) = S(2) = p_{1} q_{1}$.
This requires $p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} = 0$.
Since all terms are non-negative, this implies $p_{2} q_{5} = 0, p_{3} q_{4} = 0, p_{4} q_{3} = 0, p_{5} q_{2} = 0$.
This is not necessarily true.
Something is wrong in the logic.

<definition>The ability to identify recurring structures, symmetries, or relationships in mathematical expressions or problem contexts that can simplify analysis or suggest solution approaches.</definition>

<start>1719</start>
<end>1952</end>
<text>Let's use the expression $2 p_{1} q_{1} = S(7)$:
$2 p_{1} q_{1} = p_{1} q_{6} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$

Consider the terms in $S(7)$. We can group them symmetrically:
$S(7) = (p_{1} q_{6} + p_{6} q_{1}) + (p_{2} q_{5} + p_{5} q_{2}) + (p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3})$</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes a symmetrical pattern in the expression for S(7), grouping terms that have complementary indices. This pattern recognition helps simplify the complex expression and reveals an underlying structure that will be useful for the proof.</explanation>

<start>3347</start>
<end>3735</end>
<text>Consider the symmetry of the problem. If $p_{1}=p_{6}$ and $q_{1}=q_{6}$, then
$S(2) = p_{1} q_{1}$
$S(12) = p_{6} q_{6} = p_{1} q_{1}$, so $S(2) = S(12)$.

$S(7) = p_{1} q_{6} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$
If $p_{1}=p_{6}$ and $q_{1}=q_{6}$, then
$S(7) = p_{1} q_{1} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{1} q_{1}$
$S(7) = 2 p_{1} q_{1} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2}$</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes the symmetry in the problem structure, examining what happens when p₁=p₆ and q₁=q₆. This pattern recognition helps verify that these conditions would satisfy the given constraints, providing insight into the proof strategy.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Proof Techniques</skill>
<definition>The ability to construct logical arguments using mathematical reasoning methods such as direct proof, proof by contradiction, or proof by cases to establish the truth of mathematical statements.</definition>

<start>5120</start>
<end>5499</end>
<text>Consider the expression $(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2}$.

We know $p_{1} q_{1} = p_{6} q_{6}$. Substitute this:
$(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} - p_{6} q_{6} + p_{1} q_{1}$
$(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2}$</text>
<explanation>The solver is developing a proof by working systematically through the implications of the given conditions. They use substitution and algebraic manipulation to establish key relationships that will lead to the desired conclusion, demonstrating formal mathematical proof techniques.</explanation>

<start>6215</start>
<end>6634</end>
<text>Therefore, we must have $(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) = 0$.
This implies either $p_{1} = p_{6}$ or $q_{1} = q_{6}$.

We need to show that both are true.

Assume, for contradiction, that $p_{1} \neq p_{6}$. Then $q_{1} = q_{6}$.
Substitute $q_{1} = q_{6}$ into the equation $2 p_{1} q_{1} = S(7)$:
$2 p_{1} q_{1} = p_{1} q_{1} + p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$
$p_{1} q_{1} = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2} + p_{6} q_{1}$</text>
<explanation>The solver employs proof by contradiction, a classic mathematical proof technique. They assume that only one of the desired conditions holds (p₁≠p₆ and q₁=q₆) and work through the implications to eventually reach a contradiction, demonstrating formal logical reasoning.</explanation>

<skill>Generating Functions Approach</skill>
<definition>The ability to represent probability distributions or sequences using generating functions, which are formal power series whose coefficients encode information about the original distribution or sequence.</definition>

<start>2515</start>
<end>2856</end>
<text>Let's consider the generating functions for the distributions.
$G_{X}(t) = E[t^{X}] = p_{1} t^{1} + p_{2} t^{2} + \ldots + p_{6} t^{6}$
$G_{Y}(t) = E[t^{Y}] = q_{1} t^{1} + q_{2} t^{2} + \ldots + q_{6} t^{6}$

The generating function for the sum $Z = X+Y$ is $G_{Z}(t) = G_{X}(t) G_{Y}(t)$.
$G_{Z}(t) = (p_{1} t + p_{2} t^{2} + \ldots + p_{6} t^{6}) (q_{1} t + q_{2} t^{2} + \ldots + q_{6} t^{6})$</text>
<explanation>The solver introduces generating functions as a tool to analyze the probability distributions. This demonstrates knowledge of advanced mathematical techniques specific to probability and combinatorial problems, showing the ability to represent distributions in a form that makes their convolution (the distribution of their sum) more tractable.</explanation>

<start>2856</start>
<end>3161</end>
<text>The coefficient of $t^{k}$ in $G_{Z}(t)$ is $P(Z=k) = S(k)$.
The terms in the product that give $t^{k}$ are from $p_{i} t^{i}$ and $q_{j} t^{j}$ where $i+j=k$.
Coefficient of $t^{k}$ in $G_{Z}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{6} p_{i} q_{k-i}$, where the indices are within $[1, 6]$.

Given $S(2) = S(12)$:
Coefficient of $t^{2}$ = Coefficient of $t^{12}$ in $G_{Z}(t)$.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the generating function approach by interpreting the coefficients of the product of generating functions as probabilities of the sum. This demonstrates understanding of how generating functions encode probability distributions and how they can be used to analyze sums of random variables.</explanation>

<skill>Case Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to break down a problem into distinct scenarios or cases, analyze each case separately, and combine the results to reach a comprehensive solution.</definition>

<start>6634</start>
<end>6893</end>
<text>If $q_{1} = q_{6}$, then the equation $(p_{1} - p_{6})(q_{1} - q_{6}) = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2}$ becomes:
$0 = p_{2} q_{5} + p_{3} q_{4} + p_{4} q_{3} + p_{5} q_{2}$
Since all terms are non-negative, we must have $p_{2} q_{5} = 0, p_{3} q_{4} = 0, p_{4} q_{3} = 0, p_{5} q_{2} = 0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes a specific case (when q₁=q₆) and derives its implications, showing the ability to focus on particular scenarios to advance the proof. This case analysis helps
