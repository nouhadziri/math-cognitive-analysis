Problem:
Tom is chasing Jerry on the coordinate plane. Tom starts at  $(x, y)$  and Jerry starts at  $(0, 0)$ . Jerry moves to the right at  $1$  unit per second. At each positive integer time  $t$ , if Tom is within  $1$  unit of Jerry, he hops to Jerry’s location and catches him. Otherwise, Tom hops to the midpoint of his and Jerry’s location.

*Example. If Tom starts at  $(3, 2)$ , then at time  $t = 1$  Tom will be at  $(2, 1)$  and Jerry will be at  $(1, 0)$ . At  $t = 2$  Tom will catch Jerry.*

Assume that Tom catches Jerry at some integer time  $n$ .
(a) Show that  $x \geq 0$ .
(b) Find the maximum possible value of  $\frac{y}{x+1}$ .

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
(a) Show that \( x \geq 0 \).

1. Let \( f(t) \) denote Tom's x-coordinate at an integer time \( t \), and let \( g(t) \) denote his y-coordinate at time \( t \). We can express \( f(t) \) as follows:
   \[
   f(t) = x + \frac{1-x}{2} + \frac{3-x}{4} + \frac{7-x}{8} + \cdots + \frac{2^t-1-x}{2^t}
   \]
2. Simplify the series:
   \[
   f(t) = x + t - \left( \frac{1+x}{2} + \frac{1+x}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1+x}{2^t} \right)
   \]
3. Recognize the geometric series and simplify further:
   \[
   f(t) = x + t - (x+1) \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^t} \right)
   \]
4. The sum of the geometric series is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^t} = 1 - \frac{1}{2^t}
   \]
5. Substitute back into the expression for \( f(t) \):
   \[
   f(t) = x + t - (x+1) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^t} \right)
   \]
6. Simplify:
   \[
   f(t) = x + t - (x+1) + \frac{x+1}{2^t} = t - 1 + \frac{x+1}{2^t}
   \]

7. For \( g(t) \), we have:
   \[
   g(t) = \frac{y}{2^t}
   \]

8. Consider the distance Tom is from Jerry before jumping:
   \[
   \sqrt{(f(t-1) - t)^2 + g(t-1)^2} \leq 1
   \]

9. Substitute \( f(t-1) \) and \( g(t-1) \):
   \[
   \sqrt{\left( x + t - 1 - \frac{(x+1)(2^{t-1}-1)}{2^{t-1}} - t \right)^2 + \left( \frac{y}{2^{t-1}} \right)^2} \leq 1
   \]

10. Simplify the expression:
    \[
    \sqrt{\left( x - 1 - \frac{(x+1)(2^{t-1}-1)}{2^{t-1}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{y}{2^{t-1}} \right)^2} \leq 1
    \]

11. Further simplification:
    \[
    \sqrt{\left( x - 1 - (x+1) + \frac{x+1}{2^{t-1}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{y}{2^{t-1}} \right)^2} \leq 1
    \]

12. Finally:
    \[
    \sqrt{\left( \frac{x+1-2^t}{2^{t-1}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{y}{2^{t-1}} \right)^2} \leq 1
    \]

13. Notice that the simplified inequality resembles a circle's equation with center \( (2^t-1,0) \) and radius \( 2^{t-1} \). Since \( 2^t-1 \ge 2^{t-1} \) for all integers \( t \ge 1 \), we know that each and every solution to the inequality satisfies \( x \ge 0 \).

(b) Find the maximum possible value of \( \frac{y}{x+1} \).

1. Let the real number \( a \) be the maximum value of \( \frac{y}{x+1} \) when \( n \) is non-fixed. Then, we have the line \( ax - y + a = 0 \).

2. In order to maximize \( a \), we want to find the common tangent of all circles with radius \( 2^{t-1} \) and center \( (2^t-1,0) \).

3. The distance from these centers to the line should be equivalent to their radii. Using the perpendicular distance from a point to a line formula:
   \[
   \frac{|a(2^t-1) - 0 + a|}{\sqrt{a^2 + 1}} = \frac{|a(2^t)|}{\sqrt{a^2 + 1}}
   \]

4. This must equal \( 2^{t-1} \). Next, squaring both sides and rearranging gives:
   \[
   \left( \frac{a \cdot 2^t}{\sqrt{a^2 + 1}} \right)^2 = (2^{t-1})^2
   \]

5. Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{a^2 \cdot 2^{2t}}{a^2 + 1} = 2^{2t-2}
   \]

6. Rearrange and solve for \( a \):
   \[
   a^2 \cdot 2^{2t} = (a^2 + 1) \cdot 2^{2t-2}
   \]
   \[
   a^2 \cdot 4 = a^2 + 1
   \]
   \[
   3a^2 = 1
   \]
   \[
   a^2 = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   \[
   a = \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
   \]

7. Since we are asked to find the greatest value, our answer is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \).

The final answer is \( \boxed{ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} } \)
