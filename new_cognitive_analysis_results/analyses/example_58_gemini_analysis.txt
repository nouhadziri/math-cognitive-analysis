Problem:
Patchouli is taking an exam with  $k > 1$  parts, numbered Part  $1, 2, \dots, k$ . It is known that for  $i = 1, 2, \dots, k$ , Part  $i$  contains  $i$  multiple choice questions, each of which has  $(i+1)$  answer choices. It is known that if she guesses randomly on every single question, the probability that she gets exactly one question correct is equal to  $2018$  times the probability that she gets no questions correct. Compute the number of questions that are on the exam.

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the total number of questions on the exam, which is the sum of the number of questions in each part, i.e., $1 + 2 + \dots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$. To find this, we need to determine the value of $k$.

Let $n_i$ be the number of questions in Part $i$, and $m_i$ be the number of answer choices for each question in Part $i$.
We are given $n_i = i$ for $i = 1, 2, \dots, k$.
We are given $m_i = i+1$ for $i = 1, 2, \dots, k$.

Consider Part $i$. There are $i$ questions, each with $i+1$ answer choices.
The probability of getting a single question correct in Part $i$ is $\frac{1}{i+1}$.
The probability of getting a single question incorrect in Part $i$ is $1 - \frac{1}{i+1} = \frac{i}{i+1}$.

Let $X_i$ be the number of correct answers Patchouli gets in Part $i$. The questions in each part are independent.
For a single question in Part $i$, the probability of getting it correct is $p_i = \frac{1}{i+1}$, and the probability of getting it incorrect is $q_i = \frac{i}{i+1}$.

Probability of getting exactly $j$ questions correct in Part $i$ follows a binomial distribution $B(n=i, p=\frac{1}{i+1})$.
$P(X_i = j) = \binom{i}{j} \left(\frac{1}{i+1}\right)^j \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^{i-j}$.

Probability of getting no questions correct in Part $i$:
$P(X_i = 0) = \binom{i}{0} \left(\frac{1}{i+1}\right)^0 \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^{i-0} = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i = \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i$.

Probability of getting exactly one question correct in Part $i$:
$P(X_i = 1) = \binom{i}{1} \left(\frac{1}{i+1}\right)^1 \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^{i-1} = i \cdot \frac{1}{i+1} \cdot \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^{i-1} = i \cdot \frac{i^{i-1}}{(i+1)^i}$.

Let $E$ be the event that Patchouli gets exactly one question correct on the entire exam.
Let $Z$ be the total number of correct answers on the exam. We are interested in $P(Z=1)$.
Let $A$ be the event that Patchouli gets no questions correct on the entire exam. We are interested in $P(Z=0)$.

The events of getting questions correct in different parts are independent.
The probability of getting no questions correct in Part $i$ is $p_{0,i} = \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i$.
The probability of getting no questions correct on the entire exam is the product of the probabilities of getting no questions correct in each part:
$P(Z=0) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_{0,i} = \prod_{i=1}^k \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^3 \cdots \left(\frac{k}{k+1}\right)^k$.

Now consider the event that Patchouli gets exactly one question correct on the entire exam. This can happen in $N = \sum_{i=1}^k i = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ ways, where the single correct question is one of the questions on the exam.

Alternatively, consider the event that exactly one question is answered correctly. This means that in one of the parts, exactly one question is answered correctly, and in all other parts, zero questions are answered correctly.

Let $E_j$ be the event that exactly one question is answered correctly, and this correct question is in Part $j$.
The probability of getting exactly one question correct in Part $j$ is $p_{1,j} = i \cdot \frac{i^{i-1}}{(i+1)^i}$ with $i=j$, so $p_{1,j} = j \cdot \frac{j^{j-1}}{(j+1)^j}$.
The probability of getting no questions correct in Part $i \neq j$ is $p_{0,i} = \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i$.

The probability of event $E_j$ is the probability of getting exactly one correct in Part $j$, and zero correct in all other parts:
$P(E_j) = p_{1,j} \prod_{i \neq j} p_{0,i} = \left(j \left(\frac{j}{j+1}\right)^{j-1} \frac{1}{j+1}\right) \prod_{i \neq j} \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i$.

We have $P(Z=1) = \sum_{j=1}^k P(E_j) = \sum_{j=1}^k \left(j \left(\frac{j}{j+1}\right)^{j-1} \frac{1}{j+1}\right) \prod_{i \neq j} \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i$.

Let's write out the terms for $P(Z=0)$:
$P(Z=0) = \frac{1^1}{2^1} \cdot \frac{2^2}{3^2} \cdot \frac{3^3}{4^3} \cdots \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} = \frac{(1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots k)^k}{2^1 3^2 4^3 \cdots (k+1)^k}$.

Let's write out the terms for $P(E_j)$:
$P(E_j) = j \frac{j^{j-1}}{(j+1)^j} \cdot \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k i^i / j^j}{\prod_{i=1}^k (i+1)^i / (j+1)^j} = j \frac{j^{j-1}}{(j+1)^j} \cdot \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k i^i}{j^j} \cdot \frac{(j+1)^j}{\prod_{i=1}^k (i+1)^i}$
$P(E_j) = j \frac{j^{j-1}}{\prod_{i=1}^k i^i} \cdot \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k (i+1)^i}{(j+1)^j}$.

This seems complicated. Let's simplify the expression for $P(Z=0)$.
$P(Z=0) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2^2}{3^2} \cdot \frac{3^3}{4^3} \cdots \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k}$
$P(Z=0) = \frac{1^1 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdots k^k}{2^1 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 4^3 \cdots (k+1)^k}$.

Consider the terms in the numerator and denominator:
Numerator: $1^1 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdots k^k$
Denominator: $2^1 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 4^3 \cdots (k+1)^k$

The power of $i$ in the numerator is $i$, and in the denominator is $i-1$ (for terms involving $i$).
Let's write out the terms:
$P(Z=0) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{9} \times \frac{27}{64} \times \cdots \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k}$

Let's look at the ratio of consecutive terms:
$\frac{i^i}{(i+1)^i} / \frac{(i-1)^{i-1}}{i^{i-1}} = \frac{i^i}{(i+1)^i} \cdot \frac{i^{i-1}}{(i-1)^{i-1}} = \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i \left(\frac{i}{i-1}\right)^{i-1}$.

Consider the product term by term:
Term 1: $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1$
Term 2: $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2$
Term 3: $\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^3$
...
Term k: $\left(\frac{k}{k+1}\right)^k$

$P(Z=0) = \frac{1^1}{2^1} \cdot \frac{2^2}{3^2} \cdot \frac{3^3}{4^3} \cdots \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k}$
We can cancel terms:
$P(Z=0) = \frac{1^1 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdots k^k}{2^1 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 4^3 \cdots (k+1)^k}$

Numerator: $1 \cdot 4 \cdot 27 \cdots k^k$
Denominator: $2 \cdot 9 \cdot 64 \cdots (k+1)^k$

Consider the structure of the product:
$P(Z=0) = \prod_{i=1}^k \frac{i^i}{(i+1)^i}$.

Now consider the probability of getting exactly one question correct.
This happens if exactly one question is answered correctly, and the rest are answered incorrectly.

Consider a specific question, say the $m$-th question in Part $j$.
The probability of answering this question correctly is $\frac{1}{j+1}$.
The probability of answering all other questions incorrectly needs to be multiplied.

Consider the probability of getting the first question of Part 1 correct, and all other questions incorrect.
Prob(1st of Part 1 correct) = $\frac{1}{2}$.
Prob(all others incorrect) = Prob(Part 1, q2 incorrect) * Prob(Part 2 all incorrect) * ...
Prob(Part 1, q2 incorrect) = $\frac{1}{2}$.
Prob(Part 1 all incorrect) = $\frac{1}{2}$.

Let's use the direct approach based on events $E_j$.
$P(E_j)$ = Prob(exactly one correct in Part $j$, and zero correct in other parts).
Prob(exactly one correct in Part $j$) = $j \left(\frac{1}{j+1}\right)^1 \left(\frac{j}{j+1}\right)^{j-1} = j \frac{j^{j-1}}{(j+1)^j}$.
Prob(zero correct in Part $i \neq j$) = $\left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i$.

$P(E_j) = \left(j \frac{j^{j-1}}{(j+1)^j}\right) \prod_{i \neq j} \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i$
$P(E_j) = j \frac{j^{j-1}}{(j+1)^j} \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k i^i}{\prod_{i=1}^k (i+1)^i} \frac{(j+1)^j}{j^j}$
$P(E_j) = j \frac{j^{j-1}}{\prod_{i=1}^k i^i} \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k (i+1)^i}{(j+1)^j}$
$P(E_j) = \frac{j^j}{\prod_{i=1}^k i^i} \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k (i+1)^i}{(j+1)^j}$

$P(Z=1) = \sum_{j=1}^k P(E_j) = \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{j^j}{\prod_{i=1}^k i^i} \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k (i+1)^i}{(j+1)^j}$
$P(Z=1) = \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k (i+1)^i}{\prod_{i=1}^k i^i} \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{j^j}{(j+1)^j} = \frac{2^1 3^2 4^3 \cdots (k+1)^k}{1^1 2^2 3^3 \cdots k^k} \sum_{j=1}^k \left(\frac{j}{j+1}\right)^j$.

We are given $P(Z=1) = 2018 \cdot P(Z=0)$.
$P(Z=0) = \frac{1^1}{2^1} \cdot \frac{2^2}{3^2} \cdot \frac{3^3}{4^3} \cdots \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} = \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k i^i}{\prod_{i=1}^k (i+1)^i}$.

So, $\frac{\prod_{i=1}^k (i+1)^i}{\prod_{i=1}^k i^i} \sum_{j=1}^k \left(\frac{j}{j+1}\right)^j = 2018 \cdot \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k i^i}{\prod_{i=1}^k (i+1)^i}$.

Let $R = \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k (i+1)^i}{\prod_{i=1}^k i^i}$. Then $P(Z=0) = 1/R$.
The equation becomes $R \sum_{j=1}^k \left(\frac{j}{j+1}\right)^j = 2018 \cdot \frac{1}{R}$.
$R^2 \sum_{j=1}^k \left(\frac{j}{j+1}\right)^j = 2018$.

We have $R = \frac{2^1}{1^1} \cdot \frac{3^2}{2^2} \cdot \frac{4^3}{3^3} \cdots \frac{(k+1)^k}{k^k} = \frac{(k+1)^k}{k^{k-1} (k-1)^{k-2} \cdots 1^0}$.

Let's evaluate $R$ more carefully:
$R = \frac{2^1 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 4^3 \cdots (k+1)^k}{1^1 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdots k^k}$

Consider the terms in the numerator and denominator of $R$.
The power of $i$ in the numerator is $i-1$, from the term $(i)^i$.
The power of $i$ in the denominator is $i$.

$R = \frac{(k+1)^k}{k^{k-1} (k-1)^{k-2} \cdots 1^0}$ seems incorrect.

Let's look at the ratio of consecutive terms in the product for $R$:
$\frac{(i+1)^i}{i^i} / \frac{i^{i-1}}{(i-1)^{i-1}} = \left(\frac{i+1}{i}\right)^i \left(\frac{i-1}{i}\right)^{i-1}$.

Let's write out the terms of $R$:
$R = \frac{2^1}{1^1} \cdot \frac{3^2}{2^2} \cdot \frac{4^3}{3^3} \cdots \frac{(k+1)^k}{k^k}$
$R = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{9}{4} \cdot \frac{64}{27} \cdots \frac{(k+1)^k}{k^k}$

Consider the sum term: $\sum_{j=1}^k \left(\frac{j}{j+1}\right)^j = \sum_{j=1}^k \left(1 - \frac{1}{j+1}\right)^j$.

Let's try small values of $k$.

Case $k=2$:
$P(Z=0) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{9} = \frac{2}{9}$.
$P(Z=1) = P(\text{1st of Part 1 correct, others incorrect}) + P(\text{2nd of Part 2 correct, others incorrect})$
$P(E_1) = \text{Prob(1 correct in Part 1, 0 in Part 2)} = \binom{1}{1} (\frac{1}{2})^1 (\frac{1}{2})^0 \cdot (\frac{2}{3})^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{9} = \frac{2}{9}$.
$P(E_2) = \text{Prob(0 correct in Part 1, 1 correct in Part 2)} = (\frac{1}{2})^1 \cdot \binom{2}{1} (\frac{1}{3})^1 (\frac{2}{3})^1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{9}$.

Something is wrong in the calculation of $P(E_j)$.

Let's use the definition of $P(Z=1)$.
Exactly one correct answer means one question is correct, and all others are incorrect.
Consider the first question of Part 1. Prob(correct) = 1/2. Prob(others incorrect).
Prob(others incorrect) = Prob(Part 1, q2 incorrect) * Prob(Part 2 all incorrect)
= $\frac{1}{2} \cdot (\frac{2}{3})^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{9} = \frac{2}{9}$.
Prob(1st of Part 1 correct, others incorrect) = $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{9} = \frac{1}{9}$.

Consider the first question of Part 2. Prob(correct) = 1/3.
Prob(others incorrect) = Prob(Part 1 all incorrect) * Prob(Part 2, q2 incorrect)
= $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}$.
Prob(1st of Part 2 correct, others incorrect) = $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}$.

Consider the second question of Part 2. Prob(correct) = 1/3.
Prob(others incorrect) = Prob(Part 1 all incorrect) * Prob(Part 2, q1 incorrect)
= $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}$.
Prob(2nd of Part 2 correct, others incorrect) = $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}$.

$P(Z=1) = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}$.
$P(Z=0) = \frac{2}{9}$.
$P(Z=1) / P(Z=0) = (1/3) / (2/9) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{2} = \frac{3}{2}$.
We are given $P(Z=1) = 2018 P(Z=0)$, so $P(Z=1) / P(Z=0) = 2018$.

Let's re-evaluate $P(Z=0)$ and $P(Z=1)$.
$P(\text{no questions correct}) = \prod_{i=1}^k \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i$.

Consider the event that exactly one question is correct. This question belongs to some Part $j$.
If the correct question is the $m$-th question of Part $j$, the probability is:
Prob(m-th of Part j correct) * Prob(all others incorrect)
$= \frac{1}{j+1} \prod_{i=1}^k \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i / \left(\frac{j}{j+1}\right)^j$.

Summing over all possible single correct answers:
$P(Z=1) = \sum_{j=1}^k \sum_{m=1}^j \left( \frac{1}{j+1} \prod_{i=1}^k \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i / \left(\frac{j}{j+1}\right)^j \right)$
$P(Z=1) = \sum_{j=1}^k j \cdot \frac{1}{j+1} \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i}{\left(\frac{j}{j+1}\right)^j}$
$P(Z=1) = \left(\prod_{i=1}^k \left(\frac{i}{i+1}\right)^i\right) \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{j}{j+1} \left(\frac{j+1}{j}\right)^j$
$P(Z=1) = P(Z=0) \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{j}{j+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{j}\right)^j$.

We are given $P(Z=1) = 2018 P(Z=0)$.
$\sum_{j=1}^k \frac{j}{j+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{j}\right)^j = 2018$.

Consider the terms in the sum:
$j=1: \frac{1}{2} (2)^1 = 1$.
$j=2: \frac{2}{3} (\frac{3}{2})^2 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{4} = \frac{3}{2}$.
$j=3: \frac{3}{4} (\frac{4}{3})^3 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{64}{27} = \frac{16}{9}$.

The sum is $1 + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{16}{9} + \dots$
Term $j$: $\frac{j}{j+1} \frac{(j+1)^j}{j^j} = \frac{(j+1)^{j-1}}{j^{j-1}} = \left(1 + \frac{1}{j}\right)^{j-1}$.

The sum is $\sum_{j=1}^k \left(1 + \frac{1}{j}\right)^{j-1}$.

If $k=1$, sum = $(1+1/1)^0 = 1$.
If $k=2$, sum = $1 + (1+1/2)^1 = 1 + 3/2 = 5/2$.
If $k=3$, sum = $1 + 3/2 + (1+1/3)^2 = 1 + 3/2 + (4/3)^2 = 1 + 3/2 + 16/9 = \frac{18+27+32}{18} = \frac{77}{18}$.

We need $\sum_{j=1}^k \left(1 + \frac{1}{j}\right)^{j-1} = 2018$.

When $j$ is large, $(1 + 1/j)^{j-1} \approx e$.
The terms are increasing.

Try values of $k$.
$k=1$, sum = 1.
$k=2$, sum = 2.5.
$k=3$, sum = 4.27...
$k=4$, term = $(1+1/4)^3 = (5/4)^3 = 125/64 = 1.95...$, sum = 6.2...
$k=5$, term = $(1+1/5)^4 = (6/5)^4 = 1296/625 = 2.07...$, sum = 8.3...

The terms are roughly 2, so the sum grows roughly by 2 each step.
We need the sum to be around 2018.
The number of terms $k$ should be around $2018 / 2 = 1009$.

Total number of questions = $k(k+1)/2$.

If $k=1000$, sum $\approx 1000 \cdot e \approx 2718$.
If $k=700$, sum $\approx 700 \cdot e \approx 1900$.

Try $k=700$.

<explanation>The solver further simplifies the expression for each term in the sum through algebraic manipulation, reducing it to a more manageable form that will be easier to evaluate.</explanation>

<skill>Approximation and Estimation</skill>
<definition>The ability to make reasonable estimates or approximations of quantities when exact calculations are difficult, and to assess whether results are reasonable.</definition>

<start>6988</start>
<end>7155</end>
<text>When $j$ is large, $(1 + 1/j)^{j-1} \approx e$.
The terms are increasing.

Try values of $k$.
$k=1$, sum = 1.
$k=2$, sum = 2.5.
$k=3$, sum = 4.27...
$k=4$, term = $(1+1/4)^3 = (5/4)^3 = 125/64 = 1.95...$, sum = 6.2...</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that for large j, the terms approach e, allowing for estimation of the sum's behavior. They then calculate specific values for small k to understand how the sum grows.</explanation>

<start>7156</start>
<end>7342</end>
<text>$k=5$, term = $(1+1/5)^4 = (6/5)^4 = 1296/625 = 2.07...$, sum = 8.3...

The terms are roughly 2, so the sum grows roughly by 2 each step.
We need the sum to be around 2018.
The number of terms $k$ should be around $2018 / 2 = 1009$.</text>
<explanation>The solver makes an approximation that each term contributes about 2 to the sum, allowing them to estimate that k should be around 1009 to reach the target sum of 2018.</explanation>

<start>7386</start>
<end>7485</end>
<text>If $k=1000$, sum $\approx 1000 \cdot e \approx 2718$.
If $k=700$, sum $\approx 700 \cdot e \approx 1900$.</text>
<explanation>The solver refines their approximation using the fact that terms approach e, estimating the sum for specific values of k to narrow down the solution range.</explanation>

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify patterns, regularities, or trends in mathematical structures or sequences that can lead to insights about the problem.</definition>

<start>6328</start>
<end>6582</end>
<text>We are given $P(Z=1) = 2018 P(Z=0)$.
$\sum_{j=1}^k \frac{j}{j+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{j}\right)^j = 2018$.

Consider the terms in the sum:
$j=1: \frac{1}{2} (2)^1 = 1$.
$j=2: \frac{2}{3} (\frac{3}{2})^2 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{4} = \frac{3}{2}$.
$j=3: \frac{3}{4} (\frac{4}{3})^3 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{64}{27} = \frac{16}{9}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver evaluates specific terms in the sequence to identify patterns in how the terms behave, calculating exact values for small j to understand the pattern of growth.</explanation>

<start>6784</start>
<end>6986</end>
<text>If $k=1$, sum = $(1+1/1)^0 = 1$.
If $k=2$, sum = $1 + (1+1/2)^1 = 1 + 3/2 = 5/2$.
If $k=3$, sum = $1 + 3/2 + (1+1/3)^2 = 1 + 3/2 + (4/3)^2 = 1 + 3/2 + 16/9 = \frac{18+27+32}{18} = \frac{77}{18}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver calculates the cumulative sum for small values of k, looking for patterns in how the sum grows with each additional term, which helps in estimating the value of k needed.</explanation>
