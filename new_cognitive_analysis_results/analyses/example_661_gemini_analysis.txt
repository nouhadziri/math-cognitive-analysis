Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the length of the major axis of an ellipse given the locations of its foci and the fact that it is tangent to the $x$-axis.

The length of the major axis of an ellipse is $2a$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis.

Let the foci of the ellipse be $F_1 = (9, 20)$ and $F_2 = (49, 55)$.
The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the segment connecting the foci:
Center $C = \left( \frac{9+49}{2}, \frac{20+55}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{58}{2}, \frac{75}{2} \right) = (29, 37.5)$.

The distance between the foci is $2c$, where $c$ is the distance from the center to each focus.
$2c = \sqrt{(49-9)^2 + (55-20)^2} = \sqrt{(40)^2 + (35)^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 1225} = \sqrt{2825}$.
$2c = \sqrt{25 \times 113} = 5 \sqrt{113}$.
So, $c = \frac{5}{2} \sqrt{113}$.

The equation of an ellipse is defined by the set of points $P(x, y)$ such that the sum of the distances from $P$ to the two foci is constant, equal to the length of the major axis $2a$.
$PF_1 + PF_2 = 2a$.

The ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis. This means there is a point $(x_0, 0)$ on the ellipse.
For this point $(x_0, 0)$, the sum of the distances to the foci is $2a$.
Distance from $(x_0, 0)$ to $F_1 = (9, 20)$: $\sqrt{(x_0-9)^2 + (0-20)^2} = \sqrt{(x_0-9)^2 + 400}$.
Distance from $(x_0, 0)$ to $F_2 = (49, 55)$: $\sqrt{(x_0-49)^2 + (0-55)^2} = \sqrt{(x_0-49)^2 + 3025}$.

So, $\sqrt{(x_0-9)^2 + 400} + \sqrt{(x_0-49)^2 + 3025} = 2a$.

We need to find the value of $a$.

Consider the geometric interpretation of tangency. If the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis at a point $T$, then the normal to the ellipse at $T$ passes through the reflection of one focus across the tangent line.
The tangent line is the $x$-axis, $y=0$.

Let $F_1' = (9, -20)$ be the reflection of $F_1 = (9, 20)$ across the $x$-axis.
Let $F_2' = (49, -55)$ be the reflection of $F_2 = (49, 55)$ across the $x$-axis.

If the point of tangency is $T = (x_0, 0)$, then the line segments $TF_1$ and $TF_2$ make equal angles with the tangent line (the $x$-axis).
This implies that the line segments $TF_1'$ and $TF_2$ are collinear.
So, $T$, $F_1'$, and $F_2$ lie on a straight line.

The points are $T = (x_0, 0)$, $F_1' = (9, -20)$, $F_2 = (49, 55)$.
The slope of the line segment $TF_1'$ is $\frac{0 - (-20)}{x_0 - 9} = \frac{20}{x_0 - 9}$.
The slope of the line segment $TF_2$ is $\frac{0 - 55}{x_0 - 49} = \frac{-55}{x_0 - 49}$.

If $T, F_1', F_2$ are collinear, then the slopes are equal:
$\frac{20}{x_0 - 9} = \frac{55}{49 - x_0}$
$20(49 - x_0) = 55(x_0 - 9)$
$980 - 20x_0 = 55x_0 - 495$
$980 + 495 = 55x_0 + 20x_0$
$1475 = 75x_0$
$x_0 = \frac{1475}{75} = \frac{59 \times 25}{3 \times 25} = \frac{59}{3}$.

The point of tangency is $T = \left( \frac{59}{3}, 0 \right)$.

Now, the length of the major axis is $2a = TF_1 + TF_2$.
$TF_1 = \sqrt{\left(\frac{59}{3}-9\right)^2 + (0-20)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{59-27}{3}\right)^2 + 400} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{32}{3}\right)^2 + 400} = \sqrt{\frac{1024}{9} + 400} = \sqrt{\frac{1024 + 3600}{9}} = \sqrt{\frac{4624}{9}} = \frac{\sqrt{4624}}{3}$.

$TF_2 = \sqrt{\left(\frac{59}{3}-49\right)^2 + (0-55)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{59-147}{3}\right)^2 + 3025} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{-88}{3}\right)^2 + 3025} = \sqrt{\frac{7744}{9} + 3025} = \sqrt{\frac{7744 + 27225}{9}} = \sqrt{\frac{34969}{9}} = \frac{\sqrt{34969}}{3}$.

We need to calculate $\sqrt{4624}$ and $\sqrt{34969}$.
$\sqrt{4624} = \sqrt{16 \times 289} = 4 \times 17 = 68$.
$\sqrt{34969}$. Let's estimate: $180^2 = 32400$, $190^2 = 36100$. The number ends in 9, so the root ends in 3 or 7. Try 187: $187^2 = (190-3)^2 = 36100 - 1140 + 9 = 34969$. So $\sqrt{34969} = 187$.

$TF_1 = \frac{68}{3}$.
$TF_2 = \frac{187}{3}$.

$2a = TF_1 + TF_2 = \frac{68}{3} + \frac{187}{3} = \frac{68+187}{3} = \frac{255}{3} = 85$.
The length of the major axis is $2a = 85$.

Alternative approach using reflection property:
The distance from $F_2$ to the tangent point $T$ is equal to the distance from $F_2'$ to the tangent point $T$.
Consider the distances from the reflected focus $F_1'$ to the other focus $F_2$.
The line segment $F_1' F_2$ intersects the $x$-axis at the point of tangency $T$.
Length of $F_1' F_2 = \sqrt{(49-9)^2 + (55-(-20))^2} = \sqrt{(40)^2 + (75)^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 5625} = \sqrt{7225}$.
$\sqrt{7225}$. Ends in 5, so the root ends in 5. Try $85^2 = (80+5)^2 = 6400 + 800 + 25 = 7225$.
So, $\sqrt{7225} = 85$.

The distance between the reflected focus $F_1'$ and the other focus $F_2$ is equal to the length of the major axis $2a$.
$2a = \text{distance}(F_1', F_2)$.

Let's verify this.
Consider a point $P$ on the ellipse tangent to the $x$-axis at $T$.
$PF_1 + PF_2 = 2a$.
At the point of tangency $T$, $TF_1 + TF_2 = 2a$.
Since $T$ is on the $x$-axis, $TF_1 = TF_1'$, where $F_1'$ is the reflection of $F_1$ across the $x$-axis.
So, $TF_1' + TF_2 = 2a$.

The points $T, F_1', F_2$ are collinear.
The sum of the distances $TF_1' + TF_2$ is the length of the straight line segment from $F_1'$ to $F_2$.
$TF_1' + TF_2 = \text{distance}(F_1', F_2)$.
So, $2a = \text{distance}(F_1', F_2)$.

The reflection of $F_1 = (9, 20)$ across the $x$-axis is $F_1' = (9, -20)$.
The other focus is $F_2 = (49, 55)$.
Distance between $F_1'$ and $F_2$:
$\sqrt{(49-9)^2 + (55-(-20))^2} = \sqrt{40^2 + 75^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 5625} = \sqrt{7225} = 85$.

So, $2a = 85$. The length of the major axis is 85.

Double check the calculations.

The property used: If an ellipse is tangent to a line $L$ at a point $P$, then the line segments joining $P$ to the foci make equal angles with the tangent line $L$. Equivalently, the line segment joining one focus to the reflection of the other focus across the tangent line passes through the point of tangency.

Let the tangent line be the $x$-axis.
Foci $F_1 = (9, 20)$ and $F_2 = (49, 55)$.
Reflect $F_1$ across the $x$-axis to get $F_1' = (9, -20)$.
The line passing through $F_1'$ and $F_2$ intersects the $x$-axis at the point of tangency.
The line passing through $(9, -20)$ and $(49, 55)$.
Slope $m = \frac{55 - (-20)}{49 - 9} = \frac{75}{40} = \frac{15}{8}$.
Equation of the line: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$. Using point $(49, 55)$.
$y - 55 = \frac{15}{8}(x - 49)$.
To find the intersection with the $x$-axis, set $y=0$:
$0 - 55 = \frac{15}{8}(x - 49)$
$-55 \times 8 = 15(x - 49)$
$-440 = 15x - 735$
$735 - 440 = 15x$
$295 = 15x$
$x = \frac{295}{15} = \frac{59 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = \frac{59}{3}$.
Point of tangency $T = \left( \frac{59}{3}, 0 \right)$.

Length of the major axis $2a = PF_1 + PF_2$ for any point $P$ on the ellipse.
At the point of tangency $T$, $2a = TF_1 + TF_2$.
$TF_1 = \sqrt{\left(\frac{59}{3}-9\right)^2 + (0-20)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{32}{3}\right)^2 + 400} = \sqrt{\frac{1024}{9} + \frac{3600}{9}} = \sqrt{\frac{4624}{9}} = \frac{68}{3}$.
$TF_2 = \sqrt{\left(\frac{59}{3}-49\right)^2 + (0-55)^2} = \sqrt{\left(-\frac{88}{3}\right)^2 + 3025} = \sqrt{\frac{7744}{9} + \frac{27225}{9}} = \sqrt{\frac{34969}{9}} = \frac{187}{3}$.
$2a = \frac{68}{3} + \frac{187}{3} = \frac{255}{3} = 85$.

Consider the geometric definition of the ellipse.
The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to the length of the major axis, $2a$.

Let the point of tangency be $(x_0, 0)$.
$\sqrt{(x_0-9)^2 + 400} + \sqrt{(x_0-49)^2 + 3025} = 2a$.

We found $x_0 = \frac{59}{3}$.
$\sqrt{(\frac{59}{3}-9)^2 + 400} + \sqrt{(\frac{59}{3}-49)^2 + 3025} = 2a$.
$\sqrt{(\frac{32}{3})^2 + 400} + \sqrt{(-\frac{88}{3})^2 + 3025} = 2a$.
$\sqrt{\frac{1024}{9} + 400} + \sqrt{\frac{7744}{9} + 3025} = 2a$.
$\sqrt{\frac{4624}{9}} + \sqrt{\frac{34969}{9}} = 2a$.
$\frac{68}{3} + \frac{187}{3} = 2a$.
$\frac{255}{3} = 2a$.
$85 = 2a$.

The length of the major axis is 85.

General property:
If an ellipse with foci $F_1, F_2$ is tangent to a line $L$, then the distance from $F_1$ to its reflection $F_2'$ across the line $L$ is equal to the length of the major axis $2a$.
Proof: Let the point of tangency be $T$. Then $TF_1 + TF_2 = 2a$.
Since $T$ is on the line $L$, $TF_1 = TF_1'$, where $F_1'$ is the reflection of $F_1$ across $L$.
$TF_1' + TF_2 = 2a$.
The points $F_1', T, F_2$ are collinear, so $TF_1' + TF_2 = \text{distance}(F_1', F_2)$.
Thus, $2a = \text{distance}(F_1', F_2)$.

In this problem, the tangent line is the $x$-axis.
Foci $F_1 = (9, 20)$, $F_2 = (49, 55)$.
Reflect $F_1$ across the $x$-axis: $F_1' = (9, -20)$.
Distance between $F_1'$ and $F_2$:
$\sqrt{(49-9)^2 + (55-(-20))^2} = \sqrt{40^2 + 75^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 5625} = \sqrt{7225} = 85$.
Length of major axis $2a = 85$.

The question asks for the length of its major axis, which is $2a$.

Final check of the problem statement and question.
Ellipse with foci $(9, 20)$ and $(49, 55)$, tangent to the $x$-axis.
What is the length of its major axis?

The length of the major axis is $2a$.
We found $2a = 85$.

Consider the case where the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis.
The equation of the ellipse can be written using the foci.
Let $P = (x, y)$ be a point on the ellipse.
$\sqrt{(x-9)^2 + (y-20)^2} + \sqrt{(x-49)^2 + (y-55)^2} = 2a$.

Since the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis, there exists a point $(x_0, 0)$ on the ellipse.
$\sqrt{(x_0-9)^2 + 400} + \sqrt{(x_0-49)^2 + 3025} = 2a$.

We used the reflection property to find $2a$ directly.
The reflection property is a powerful tool for problems involving tangency and foci of ellipses (and hyperbolas).

<text>We found $x_0 = \frac{59}{3}$.
$\sqrt{(\frac{59}{3}-9)^2 + 400} + \sqrt{(\frac{59}{3}-49)^2 + 3025} = 2a$.
$\sqrt{(\frac{32}{3})^2 + 400} + \sqrt{(-\frac{88}{3})^2 + 3025} = 2a$.
$\sqrt{\frac{1024}{9} + 400} + \sqrt{\frac{7744}{9} + 3025} = 2a$.
