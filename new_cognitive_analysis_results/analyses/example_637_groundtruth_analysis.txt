Problem:
iv. At some radius $r_{3} \ll r_{0}$, the gas becomes dense enough to be opaque to the heat radiation. Calculate the amount of heat $Q$ radiated away during the collapse from the radius $r_{0}$ down to $r_{3}$.

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
By Clapeyron-Mendeleyev law,

$$
p=\frac{m R T_{0}}{\mu V}
$$

Work done by gravity to compress the ball is

$$
W=-\int p d V=-\frac{m R T_{0}}{\mu} \int_{\frac{4}{3} \pi r_{0}^{3}}^{\frac{4}{3} \pi r_{3}^{3}} \frac{d V}{V}=\frac{3 m R T_{0}}{\mu} \ln \frac{r_{0}}{r_{3}}
$$

The temperature stays constant, so the internal energy does not change; hence, according to the $1^{\text {st }}$ law of thermodynamics, the compression work $W$ is the heat radiated.

<explanation>The solver models the physical process of gravitational compression by expressing it as the work done, mathematically represented as the integral of pressure with respect to volume.

<explanation>The solver further develops the mathematical model by substituting the pressure expression from the ideal gas law into the work integral, setting appropriate limits of integration based on the initial and final radii, and expressing the volume in terms of radius.

<explanation>The solver makes a crucial conceptual connection between the work calculated and the heat radiated. By recognizing that in an isothermal process the internal energy remains constant, they apply the first law of thermodynamics to conclude that the work done equals the heat transferred. This demonstrates the ability to connect multiple concepts (work, heat, internal energy, thermodynamic laws) to reach the solution.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver uses geometric reasoning when setting up the integral limits using the formula for the volume of a sphere (V = 4/3πr³) and when transforming between volume and radius representations. This shows understanding of how the geometric properties of the system relate to the physical quantities being calculated.</explanation>
