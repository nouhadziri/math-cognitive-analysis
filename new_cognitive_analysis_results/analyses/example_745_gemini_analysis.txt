Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let K be a compact Hausdorff space.
We are given that $K = \cup_{n=0}^{\infty} A_n$, where each $A_n$ is metrizable and $A_n \subset A_m$ for $n < m$.
We need to prove that K is metrizable.

Since K is a compact Hausdorff space, it is normal.
Since each $A_n$ is metrizable, it has a countable basis.
The condition $A_n \subset A_m$ for $n < m$ means that the sequence of sets is increasing.

Consider a countable basis $B_n$ for the topology of $A_n$. However, the topology on $A_n$ is the subspace topology inherited from K.

Let $d_n$ be a metric on $A_n$ that induces the topology on $A_n$.

Since K is compact Hausdorff, it is regular.
For each point $x \in K$, there exists some $n$ such that $x \in A_n$.

Consider the case where K is the countable union of open metrizable subsets. In this case, if K is also locally metrizable, then K is metrizable. However, here we have a union of metrizable subsets, not necessarily open.

Let's consider the properties of metrizable spaces. A Hausdorff space is metrizable if and only if it is regular and has a countable basis. We know K is Hausdorff and regular. We need to show that K has a countable basis.

Since $A_n$ is metrizable, there exists a countable basis $B_n$ for the topology on $A_n$. The topology on $A_n$ is the subspace topology from K. So each element of $B_n$ is of the form $U \cap A_n$ where U is open in K.

Let $x \in K$. Then $x \in A_n$ for some $n$. Since $A_n$ is metrizable, there exists a countable local basis at $x$ in $A_n$. Let this be $\{V_{n,k} \cap A_n\}_{k=1}^\infty$, where $V_{n,k}$ are open sets in K.

Let's consider the special case where $K = \overline{\cup_{n=0}^\infty A_n}$. Since $K = \cup_{n=0}^\infty A_n$, this is already the case.

Consider the case where $K = \mathbb{R}^\omega$ in the box topology. This is not metrizable. However, this is not compact.

Consider the case where $K = [0, 1]$. Let $A_n = [0, 1 - 1/(n+1))$. Each $A_n$ is metrizable, and $A_n \subset A_{n+1}$. The union is $[0, 1)$. This is not K.
Let $A_n = [0, 1]$. Then the conditions are satisfied and K is metrizable.

Let $A_n = (-n, n)$. The union is $\mathbb{R}$, which is metrizable but not compact.

Since $A_n$ is metrizable, it has a $\sigma$-locally finite basis.

Let's use the property that a compact Hausdorff space is metrizable if and only if it is second-countable. We need to show that K has a countable basis.

Let $B_n$ be a countable basis for the topology of $A_n$.
The open sets in $A_n$ are of the form $U \cap A_n$ where U is open in K.

Consider the set of all open sets in $A_n$. Let $\mathcal{B}_n$ be a countable basis for $A_n$.
Each element $B \in \mathcal{B}_n$ is of the form $U_B \cap A_n$ for some open set $U_B$ in $K$.
Let $\mathcal{B} = \cup_{n=0}^\infty \{ U \text{ open in } K \mid U \cap A_n \in \mathcal{B}_n \}$. This is not necessarily countable.

Since $K$ is compact and Hausdorff, it is normal.
For any two disjoint closed sets $C, D$ in $K$, there exist disjoint open sets $U, V$ such that $C \subset U$ and $D \subset V$.

Since $A_n$ is metrizable, there is a countable basis for $A_n$.
Let $\mathcal{B}_n$ be a countable basis for the topology of $A_n$.

Let $x \in K$. Then $x \in A_n$ for some $n$.
Since $A_n$ is metrizable, there is a countable local base at $x$ in $A_n$.
Let $\{U_{n,k} \cap A_n\}_{k=1}^\infty$ be a countable local base at $x$ in $A_n$, where $U_{n,k}$ are open in K.

Let's consider the concept of a regular basis. A basis $\mathcal{B}$ for a space $X$ is regular if for every open set $U$ and every point $x \in U$, there exists a $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B \subset \overline{B} \subset U$.

Since $A_n$ is metrizable, it has a $\sigma$-locally finite basis.

Let's use the fact that a compact Hausdorff space is metrizable iff there exists a countable collection of open sets $\{U_n\}$ such that for any $x \in K$ and any open neighborhood $V$ of $x$, there exists some $n$ such that $x \in U_n \subset V$.

Let $x \in K$. Then $x \in A_n$ for some $n$. Let $V$ be an open neighborhood of $x$ in K.
Since the topology on $A_n$ is the subspace topology, $V \cap A_n$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ in $A_n$.
Since $A_n$ is metrizable, there exists a countable basis $\mathcal{B}_n$ for $A_n$.
There exists $B \in \mathcal{B}_n$ such that $x \in B \subset V \cap A_n$.
$B = W \cap A_n$ for some open set $W$ in K.
So $x \in W \cap A_n \subset V \cap A_n$. This implies $x \in W \subset V$.

Let $\mathcal{B}_n$ be a countable basis for $A_n$. Each element of $\mathcal{B}_n$ is of the form $U \cap A_n$ where U is open in K.
Let $\mathcal{C} = \cup_{n=0}^\infty \mathcal{B}_n$. This is a countable collection of subsets of K.
We need to show that this forms a basis for K.
Let $U$ be an open set in K and $x \in U$.
Since $K = \cup_{n=0}^\infty A_n$, there exists some $m$ such that $x \in A_m$.
Then $U \cap A_m$ is an open set in $A_m$.
Since $\mathcal{B}_m$ is a basis for $A_m$, there exists $B \in \mathcal{B}_m$ such that $x \in B \subset U \cap A_m$.
$B \in \mathcal{C}$.
We have $B \subset U \cap A_m \subset U$.
So for every open set $U$ and $x \in U$, there exists $B \in \mathcal{C}$ such that $x \in B \subset U$.
Thus $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis for the topology of K.
Since $\mathcal{C}$ is a countable union of countable sets, $\mathcal{C}$ is countable.
Since K is Hausdorff and has a countable basis, K is metrizable.

Let's write down the argument more formally.
Since each $A_n$ is metrizable, it has a countable basis for its topology. Let $\mathcal{B}_n$ be a countable basis for the topology of $A_n$.
The topology on $A_n$ is the subspace topology inherited from K. Therefore, every element $B \in \mathcal{B}_n$ is of the form $U \cap A_n$ for some open set $U$ in K.

Consider the collection $\mathcal{B} = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty \mathcal{B}_n$. Since each $\mathcal{B}_n$ is countable, and the union is over a countable index set, $\mathcal{B}$ is a countable collection of subsets of K.

We will show that $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for the topology of K. Let $W$ be an arbitrary open set in K, and let $x$ be an arbitrary point in $W$. Since $K = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty A_n$, there exists some index $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x \in A_m$.

Since $W$ is open in K, the intersection $W \cap A_m$ is an open set in the subspace topology of $A_m$. Since $\mathcal{B}_m$ is a basis for the topology of $A_m$, and $x \in W \cap A_m$, there exists an element $B \in \mathcal{B}_m$ such that $x \in B \subseteq W \cap A_m$.

Since $B \in \mathcal{B}_m$, it follows that $B \in \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty \mathcal{B}_n = \mathcal{B}$.
We have $x \in B$ and $B \subseteq W \cap A_m$. Since $W \cap A_m \subseteq W$, we have $B \subseteq W$.
Thus, for every open set $W$ in K and every point $x \in W$, there exists an element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B \subseteq W$. This shows that $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for the topology of K.

Since $\mathcal{B}$ is a countable basis for the topology of K, and K is a compact Hausdorff space (hence regular), K is metrizable by the Urysohn metrization theorem.

<text>We will show that $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for the topology of K. Let $W$ be an arbitrary open set in K, and let $x$ be an arbitrary point in $W$. Since $K = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty A_n$, there exists some index $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x \in A_m$.

Since $W$ is open in K, the intersection $W \cap A_m$ is an open set in the subspace topology of $A_m$. Since $\mathcal{B}_m$ is a basis for the topology of $A_m$, and $x \in W \cap A_m$, there exists an element $B \in \mathcal{B}_m$ such that $x \in B \subseteq W \cap A_m$.

Since $B \in \mathcal{B}_m$, it follows that $B \in \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty \mathcal{B}_n = \mathcal{B}$.
We have $x \in B$ and $B \subseteq W \cap A_m$. Since $W \cap A_m \subseteq W$, we have $B \subseteq W$.
Thus, for every open set $W$ in K and every point $x \in W$, there exists an element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B \subseteq W$. This shows that $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for the topology of K.

Then $U \cap A_m$ is an open set in $A_m$.

$B \in \mathcal{C}$.

Thus $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis for the topology of K.

<explanation>The solver uses deductive reasoning to establish a chain of logical implications: if x is in W, then x is in some A_m, which means there's a basis element B containing x and contained in W∩A_m, which means B is in the collection B and B is contained in W.
