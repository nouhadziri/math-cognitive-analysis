Problem:
B. How many times would the resolving power of the above microscope increase or decrease if the electron beam were replaced with the proton beam? Assume that the resolving power of the microscope (i.e. the smallest distance between two point objects whose circular images can be just separated) depends only on the wave properties of the particles.

Assume that the velocities of the electrons and protons before their acceleration are zero, and that there is no interaction between own magnetic moment of either electrons or protons and the magnetic field. Assume also that the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the moving particles can be neglected.

NOTE: Very often physicists use 1 electron-volt $(1 \mathrm{eV})$, and its derivatives such as 1 $\mathrm{keV}$ or $1 \mathrm{MeV}$, as a unit of energy. 1 electron-volt is the energy gained by the electron that passed the potential difference equal to $1 \mathrm{~V}$.

Perform the calculations assuming the following data:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\text { Rest energy of electron: } & E_{e}=m_{e} c^{2}=511 \mathrm{keV} \\
\text { Rest energy of proton: } & E_{p}=m_{p} c^{2}=938 \mathrm{MeV}
\end{array}
$$

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so the problem is asking about the resolving power of a microscope when switching from an electron beam to a proton beam. The resolving power depends on the wavelength of the particles used, right? So electrons and protons have different masses, which will affect their wavelengths even if they have the same energy. Hmm, but wait, the problem says to assume that the resolving power depends only on the wave properties of the particles. So, I think that means the resolution is inversely proportional to the wavelength (like in the Rayleigh criterion for resolution). So, shorter wavelength means better resolution (can resolve smaller details). Therefore, if the proton's wavelength is longer than the electron's wavelength under the same conditions, then the resolving power would decrease. Conversely, if the proton's wavelength is shorter, then the resolving power would increase.

But I need to calculate how much the resolving power changes. So first, I need to find the wavelength of electrons and protons under the same acceleration conditions. Since the velocities of both particles start from zero and they are accelerated, we can assume they're accelerated through the same potential difference, right? But the problem doesn't specify the potential difference. Oh, maybe the energy given to the electrons and protons is the same? Wait, the problem statement gives the rest energies of electrons and protons. Rest energy is just mc2, so that's given to help us compute their masses? Maybe.

Wait, let me reread the problem:

"Assume that the resolving power of the microscope depends only on the wave properties of the particles. Assume that the velocities of the electrons and protons before their acceleration are zero, and that there is no interaction between own magnetic moment of either electrons or protons and the magnetic field. Assume also that the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the moving particles can be neglected."

So the key is probably finding the wavelength of electrons vs. protons when accelerated by the same potential. But the note mentions that 1 eV is the energy gained by an electron passing through 1 V. So perhaps the energy given to the particles is in electron volts? But typically, when accelerating particles through a potential difference V, the kinetic energy gained is qV, where q is the charge. Since both electrons and protons have the same charge magnitude (e), just opposite sign. But the problem states that the resolving power depends only on the wave properties, so we can ignore other factors like their actual trajectories or interactions.

So to compare their wavelengths, we need to calculate the de Broglie wavelengths for electrons and protons accelerated through the same potential difference. Let's recall the formula for the de Broglie wavelength.

The de Broglie wavelength lambda is given by lambda = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum.

To find p, we can use the relation between kinetic energy (K) and momentum. However, if the particles are accelerated through a potential V, their kinetic energy K is equal to eV (if we're using non-relativistic speeds, which is probably the case since electrons in electron microscopes are often at high speeds but maybe still non-relativistic? Hmm, but given that the rest energy of an electron is 511 keV, if the accelerating voltage is, say, 100 kV, that's 100 keV, which is a significant fraction of the rest energy, so maybe we have to consider relativistic effects. However, the problem says "Assume that the resolving power ... depends only on the wave properties of the particles", so perhaps it just wants us to compare their wavelengths regardless of speed considerations, but given the rest energies are provided, maybe a relativistic calculation is necessary.

Wait, the problem's note says 1 eV is the energy gained by an electron passing through 1 V, so that's just the standard definition. So when they are accelerated through the same potential, electrons and protons would gain kinetic energy K = eV. However, protons are much more massive, so their velocities will be much lower.

But in terms of calculating the de Broglie wavelength, we need momentum, which depends on their velocity. For non-relativistic speeds, momentum p = sqrt(2 m K). So then, lambda = h / sqrt(2 m K). If both particles are accelerated through the same potential V, so K = eV, then their wavelengths would be inversely proportional to the square root of their masses. So, lambda is proportional to 1 / sqrt(m). Therefore, since protons are heavier, their wavelength would be smaller? Wait, but if proton's mass is higher, sqrt(m) is higher, so 1/sqrt(m) is smaller. So the wavelength of a proton would be smaller than that of an electron accelerated through the same potential? Then that would mean better resolving power (smaller wavelength, so higher resolution). But protons are heavier, so their momentum is higher?

Wait, no, because momentum p = sqrt(2 m K). For same K (since K = eV), m is larger for protons. Therefore, sqrt(2 m K) increases with m, so p increases, so lambda = h/p decreases. Therefore, the proton's wavelength is smaller. Therefore, resolution would be better (smaller resolvable distance). But then if we switch from electron to proton, the resolving power would improve.

But wait, doesn't the charge of the proton matter? Wait, no, because kinetic energy K = eV is same for proton and electron when accelerated through the same potential difference. Since the charge is same in magnitude (proton has +e, electron -e), but kinetic energy is same.

Wait, but then, protons, with same K, would have λ = h / sqrt(2 m K). So for same K, since m_p > m_e, λ_p < λ_e, so resolving power (which is proportional to 1 / λ) would be better (higher). Thus, using protons, which have smaller wavelength, would increase the resolving power.

But wait, that contradicts with my initial thought. Wait, no. Wait, no, because if you replace electrons (small mass) with protons (large mass), if we accelerate them through the same potential, then their kinetic energies are the same but their momentum is higher for protons, so wavelength is smaller, hence higher resolution.

But here's the problem: in electron microscopes, the electrons are accelerated through a known potential, which gives them kinetic energy. So if replacing electrons with protons accelerated through the same potential, you get higher momentum (because of higher mass), hence shorter wavelength, so better resolution.

But is that the case here? Wait, need to check if K is same (i.e., same accelerating voltage) or if the speed is same. But problem says velocities before acceleration are zero. After acceleration, they would have velocities dependent on their charge and mass.

But in the problem statement, since it says "the resolving power ... depends only on the wave properties", which relate to their de Broglie wavelengths, which depend on their momentum.

Therefore, if both particles are accelerated through the same potential, then K = eV.

But if the rest energies are given, maybe relativistic effects are non-negligible.

But let me first check whether given the rest energy, we can use the non-relativistic or relativistic formula.

For example, for electrons, if the kinetic energy eV is non-relativistic (K << m_e c2), which might be even up to, say, 100 keV? Since the rest energy is 511 keV, that's about 20% of its rest energy, so some relativistic effects, but maybe still manageable with non-relativistic approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to treat both non-relativistically or relativistically?

The problem does not specify the accelerating voltage. It just says "assume the following data", which are the rest energies.

Wait, but in this problem, maybe it's supposed to assume that the electrons and protons are accelerated through a potential difference such that their kinetic energy is same as their rest energy? No, the problem does not specify. Wait, maybe when you replace an electron beam with a proton beam, the accelerating voltage is same?

Wait, the problem could be a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read:

"How many times would the resolving power of the above microscope increase or decrease if the electron beam were replaced with the proton beam?"

So replacing electron with proton, while presumably keeping the same accelerating voltage. So if previously electrons were accelerated through a voltage V, now protons are accelerated through the same voltage V. Then, K_e = eV (kinetic energy of electron) and K_p = eV (kinetic energy of proton). Then compute their wavelengths.

But if we use non-relativistic:

p = sqrt(2 m K)

Thus, wavelength λ = h / sqrt(2 m K)

Therefore, λ is inversely proportional to sqrt(m)

Therefore, going from electron to proton, m increases by m_p / m_e. So, wavelength scales as 1 / sqrt(m_p/m_e) = sqrt(m_e/m_p). Therefore, λ_p = λ_e * sqrt(m_e/m_p)

Resolving power is inversely proportional to λ, thus, resolving power ratio (proton/electron) would be (λ_e / λ_p) = sqrt(m_p/m_e)

Given that rest energy for electron is 511 keV, and for proton is 938 MeV. For rest energy E = m c2, thus m = E / c2. Therefore, m_p/m_e = E_p / E_e = (938 MeV) / (511 keV) = (938 *10^6 eV) / (511*10^3 eV) ) = (938000 / 511) ≈ 1836. Therefore, m_p/m_e ≈1836. So sqrt(1836) ≈42.85

Therefore, resolving power would be increased by a factor of approximately 42.85 if switching from electrons to protons accelerated through the same voltage. Therefore, resolving power would increase by about 43 times.

But wait, but maybe relativistic effects are important. Let me check. Suppose the accelerating voltage is such that the kinetic energy is 511 keV for electrons. Then the relativistic total energy would be E = gamma m c2 = K + m c2 = 511 keV + 511 keV = 1022 keV. So gamma = 2. So the momentum would be p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c. But since gamma = 2, v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2) c = sqrt(3)/2 c ≈0.866c. Then p = (2)(m_e)(sqrt(3)/2 c) = m_e c sqrt(3). Then lambda = h / p = h / (m_e c sqrt(3)).

But wait, if non-relativistic, K = (1/2) m v2. So for K = 511 keV, which is equal to rest energy, the velocity would be v = sqrt(2 K / m) = sqrt(2*(511,000 eV)/(511,000 eV/c2)))= sqrt(2 c2) = sqrt(2) c, which is impossible. Thus, the non-relativistic approximation breaks down at kinetic energies comparable to rest energy. Therefore, the 511 keV accelerating voltage (with rest energy 511 keV) would require relativistic treatment.

But the problem did not specify the accelerating voltage. It's possible that the voltage is low enough that non-relativistic speeds can be assumed. But since rest energies are given, maybe relativistic formulas are needed.

Wait, perhaps it's best to use the general formula for the de Broglie wavelength in terms of the kinetic energy, regardless of relativistic effects. So to compute the wavelength given any kinetic energy, we'd need to use the relativistic relation between kinetic energy and momentum.

The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E2 = (pc)2 + (m c2)2. Here E is the total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy). So, E = K + m c2.

Therefore, (K + m c2)2 = (pc)2 + (m c2)2

Expanding:

K2 + 2 K m c2 + m2 c^4 = p2 c2 + m2 c^4

Cancels m2 c^4:

K2 + 2 K m c2 = p2 c2

Thus, pc = sqrt(K2 + 2 K m c2)

Then, p = sqrt(K2 + 2 K m c2)/c

Then, the de Broglie wavelength lambda = h / p = h c / sqrt(K2 + 2 K m c2)

Therefore, given the same kinetic energy K = eV, the wavelength would be different for electrons and protons.

Thus, we can compute:

lambda_e = h c / sqrt( (eV)^2 + 2 eV m_e c2 )

lambda_p = h c / sqrt( (eV)^2 + 2 eV m_p c2 )

Therefore, the ratio of wavelengths is lambda_p / lambda_e = sqrt( (eV)^2 + 2 eV m_e c2 ) / sqrt( (eV)^2 + 2 eV m_p c^2 )

But since protons are much heavier, m_p c2 >> m_e c2. Which is given, since m_p c2=938 MeV, and m_e c2=511 keV. So, given that K=eV is presumably same for both, if the accelerating voltage is same.

Thus, the terms 2 eV m_e c2 and 2 eV m_p c2 will dominate over (eV)^2 if eV << m c2.

But if eV is comparable to the rest energy, then both terms are similar.

But without specific accelerating voltage, but given that the rest energies are provided, I think the problem might assume that the kinetic energy is the same, so we can compute ratio lambda_p / lambda_e by comparing for same K.

But let's proceed.

If kinetic energy is K=eV for both.

Thus:

lambda_e = h c / sqrt( K2 + 2 K m_e c2 )

lambda_p = h c / sqrt( K2 + 2 K m_p c2 )

Thus, the ratio (lambda_p)/(lambda_e) = sqrt( (K2 + 2 K m_e c2) / (K2 + 2 K m_p c2 ) )

Then, the resolving power is inversely proportional to wavelength. Therefore, resolving_power_p / resolving_power_e = lambda_e / lambda_p = sqrt( (K2 + 2 K m_p c2 ) / (K2 + 2 K m_e c2) )

Now, simplifying this expression:

Let me define x = K / (m_e c2), or rather, x = K / (m_p c2)

Wait, perhaps not, but maybe express in terms of K / (m_e c2). Let's parameterize K as a multiple of m_e c2 and m_p c2. Let's denote that the problem gives both rest energies as m_e c2=511 keV and m_p c2=938 MeV. So ratios between K and rest energies may be significant.

Suppose the accelerating voltage gives K = same for electrons and protons (say, K = eV). For example, let's say they are accelerated through a potential V where eV = K. But then, because m_p is so much larger, m_p c2=938 MeV vs. m_e c2=511 keV=0.511 MeV.

For example, if the accelerating voltage is such that K=1 keV.

So for electron, K=1 keV=0.001 MeV, which is about 0.001 / 0.511 ≈ 0.2% of rest energy. So non-relativistic. Then 2 K m_e c2=2*(0.001 MeV)*(0.511 MeV) ≈ 0.001022 (MeV)^2. Whereas K2 = (0.001 MeV)^2 =1e-6 (MeV)^2. So 2 K m_e c2 >> K2. Therefore, sqrt(2 K m_e c2 ) would dominate. Then, lambda_e ≈ h c / sqrt(2 K m_e c2 )

Similarly, for protons, K=1 keV=0.001 MeV. The rest energy is 938 MeV. Then 2 K m_p c2=2*0.001 MeV*938 MeV=1.876 (MeV)^2, while K2=1e-6 (MeV)^2. So similarly, 2 K m_p c2 >> K2. So lambda_p≈ h c / sqrt(2 K m_p c2 )

Therefore, lambda_p / lambda_e ≈ sqrt(2 K m_e c2 ) / sqrt(2 K m_p c2 ) ) = sqrt( m_e/m_p )

Therefore, λ_p = λ_e * sqrt(m_e/m_p )

Hence, resolving power increases by sqrt(m_p/m_e).

Which is the same conclusion as before, non-relativistic.

But if K becomes a significant fraction of rest energy, then relativistic terms will matter.

However, without specific K, perhaps the answer is supposed to be in terms of rest energies. Since the problem provides rest energies, maybe they want that considered?

Wait, but the question says "the velocities of the electrons and protons before their acceleration are zero, and that there is no interaction between own magnetic moment of either electrons or protons and the magnetic field."

Hmm. If velocities after acceleration depend on the energy.

Wait, perhaps we can think that they are accelerated through the same voltage. So same potential difference. Therefore, same kinetic energy (since kinetic energy is eV for charge e). So same K. Then take the ratio of the wavelengths, as above.

But then regardless of speeds or accelerators, if same K, same formulas.

But the issue is, if they are accelerated through the same voltage, how does K compare? Wait, protons and electrons accelerated through same voltage V both gain kinetic energy of eV. But because protons are more massive, their speed will be lower.

But once K is same, the wavelengths depend on sqrt(m) as per non-relativistic or λ ~1 / sqrt( m ) from relativistic?

Wait, but in reality, from the relativistic formula:

If 2 K m c2 >> K2, then pc = sqrt( K2 + 2 K m c2 ) ≈ sqrt(2 K m c2 ), so p ≈ sqrt(2 K m c2 ) / c.

Hence, lambda = h/p ≈ h c / sqrt( 2 K m c2 ) = h / sqrt( 2 K m )

Which is same as non-relativistic formula where K = (1/2) m v2, so that p = m v = sqrt( 2 m K )

Thus, in either case, non-relativistic or relativistic (at least in the limit where K << mc2 but just even if K ~ mc2, provided how you compare different m), the lambda ends up being h / sqrt(2 m K )

But if K is same for electrons and protons, then their wavelengths would be proportional to 1 / sqrt(m). Since m_p > m_e, Lambda_p = lambda_e * sqrt( m_e / m_p )

Hence, the ratio of resolving power (which is 1 / lambda) would be sqrt( m_p / m_e )

But m_p c2= 938 MeV, m_e c2=0.511 MeV, so m_p/m_e =938 MeV / 0.511 MeV= 938 / 0.511 ≈ 1836

So sqrt(1836)= approx 42.85

Hence, resolving power would increase 42.85 times, so about 43 times.

But to check if that's correct, let's confirm units and calculus.

Alternatively, we can compute lambda_e / lambda_p = sqrt( ( m_p c2 * ( 2 K + m_p c2 ) / m_e c2 ) / ( 2 K + m_e c2 )) ) hmm no.

Wait, with the relativistic equation:

lambda_e = h c / sqrt( K^2 + 2 K m_e c^2 )

lambda_p = h c / sqrt( K^2 + 2 K m_p c^2 )

Ratio is sqrt( (K^2 + 2 K m_e c^2 ) / (K^2 + 2 K m_p c^2 ) )

But when K is very small compared to m c^2,

Ratio approximates to sqrt ( (2 K m_e c^2)/(2 K m_p c^2) )= sqrt( m_e/m_p )= 1 / sqrt( m_p/m_e )

Therefore, resolving power (1/λ) scales as sqrt(m_p/m_e )

But if K is comparable to m c2, we need to actually compute the ratio inside the sqrt. If K is large compared to mc2, then:

If K >> m_e c2 and K >> m_p c^2, then ratio becomes sqrt( K^2 / K^2 ) =1. So for ultrarelativistic particles, same K, same wavelength. But proton needs K thousands of times higher (since m_p/m_e ~1800) to reach the same regime. Therefore, assuming that we don't know K, but we might assume that protons and electrons are accelerated through same potential V, so gain same kinetic energy K= eV. Then, if V is such that electrons become relativistic (e.g., 511 keV), would proton be non-relativistic. For example, if V = 511 keV, kinetic energy of electrons would be equal to rest energy. For the proton, m_p c2=938 MeV, so 511 keV is much less than 938 MeV (about 0.05% of it). Therefore, non-relativistic.

Thus, in that case, for electrons:

lambda_e = h c / sqrt( (511 keV)^2 + 2 *511 keV * 511 keV ) = h c / sqrt( (511 keV)^2 (1 + 2) )= h c / (511 keV sqrt(3))= hc/(511,000 eV sqrt(3)) and in terms of wavelength.

Wait, but in that case, electrons would have gamma factor of 2 (since K= m c2). So in any case, the results would be relativistic.

So, but the problem is about switching from electrons to protons with given rest energies, perhaps this is under the same acceleration voltage. And under that voltage, electrons can be relativistic, but protons would be non-relativistic. Therefore, in that case, since resolving power is same K:

lambda_e (relativistic) = h c /sqrt( K^2 + 2 K m_e c2 )

lamdba_p (non-relativistic)= h / sqrt(2 m_p K )

Then their ratio would be:

lambda_p / lambda_e = [ h / sqrt(2 m_p K ) ] / [ h c / sqrt( K^2 + 2 K m_e c2 ) ]

= sqrt( K^2 + 2 K m_e c2 ) / ( c sqrt( 2 m_p K ) )

Assuming K= m_e c2 (if accelerated through 511 kV for electrons). Then for protons, eV= K= m_e c2≈0.511 MeV. And m_p c2=938 MeV, so proton's K=0.511 MeV is <<938 MeV.

So then sqrt( (0.511)^2 + 2*0.511 *0.511 ) MeV2 )

= sqrt( 0.261 +0.522 ) = sqrt(0.783)≈0.884 MeV

Thus, numerator≈0.884 MeV, denominator.= c sqrt( 2 *938 *0.511 ) MeV^(1/2) ~ sqrt(2*938*0.511) * c * sqrt(MeV)

Wait, not sure. Maybe better to compute units correctly.

Alternatively, use SI units.

But since the actual numerical constants cancel, perhaps easier.

Alternatively, use the given rest energies.

Given that for electron, m_e c2=0.511 MeV.

For protons, m_p c2=938 MeV.

If the kinetic energy K= eV same for both. For the electron, suppose it's accelerated through voltage V= V0, then K= eV0=0.511 MeV (rest energy for electron). Then the proton accelerated through same V0 would have K= eV0=0.511 MeV.

So for electron:

E = K + m_e c2= 0.511 MeV +0.511 MeV=1.022 MeV.

Momentum pc= sqrt( (E)^2 - (m_e c2)^2 )=sqrt(1.0222 -0.5112) MeV=√(1.044 -0.261)=sqrt(0.783)=approx 0.884 MeV.

Then lambda_e= h c / (pc)= (12.4 keV·Å) / (0.884 MeV). Hmm, maybe impractical to calculate actual numbers.

Alternatively, use formula:

lambda_e= h c / sqrt( K^2 + 2 K m_e c2 )

We have K=0.511 MeV.

Compute:

K2= (0.511)^2*(MeV)^2≈0.261 (MeV)^2

2 K m_e c2=2*(0.511)*(0.511)=0.522 (MeV)^2

Total under sqrt:≈0.261 +0.522=0.783 (MeV)^2

So sqrt(0.783)=≈0.885 MeV. Thus, lambda_e= h c / (0.885 MeV) For the proton, K=0.511 MeV, m_p c2=938 MeV.

Proton's momentum:

 pc= sqrt( K2 + 2 K m_p c2 )≈sqrt(0.5112 + 2 *0.511*938 )(MeV)^2

Approx. Calculating inside:

0.5112≈0.261, and 2*0.511*938≈2*0.511≈1.022, 1.022*938≈958.

Thus, under the square root:≈0.261 +958≈958.261≈958.261.

Square root is≈30.96 MeV.

Thus, lambda_p= h c / (30.96 MeV).

Then, the ratio lambda_p / lambda_e= (0.885 MeV)/(30.96 MeV)=≈0.0286

Therefore, approx 0.0286 times. Then, resolving power is inverse of that: 1 /0.0286≈34.97≈35.

Hmm, but the rest mass ratio is much larger. Wait, in that case, even with same K=rest energy of the electron (0.511 MeV), the resulting lambda for proton was≈35 times smaller, leading to 35x better resolving power. So in this case, 35x.

But the non-relativistic assumption (when K is much less than rest energy for proton) would give≈sqrt(m_p/m_e)=sqrt(938/0.511)=sqrt(1835≈42.85). However, in our calculation with K=0.511 MeV (which is close to electron's Rest energy but much smaller than proton's rest energy), getting≅35x.

Wait, that's slightly different from the non-relativistic result. Hence, to get precise answer we need to know the potential V.

However, the problem might Assume in general that we can use the nonrelativistic formula. Because it didn't specify the acceleration voltage. Given that since the problem is for an olympiad, probably students are expected to use non-relativistic expressions. So I think the key factor here is whether to use relativistic equations or not. But perhaps, given that the problem provides rest energies, we need to use relativistic equations.

Alternatively, it might be expecting a rest mass ratio answer where the resolving power scaling is 1/sqrt(m_p/m_e). Wait, no—the above result computed 35 times improvement, which is lower than the non-relativistic result of≈42.8.

But in the absence of specific information about accelerating voltage, the safest assumption is that we are to use the rest energies and voltage such that K is equal to m_e c2. Or not. Alternatively, perhaps in the absence of specific data, we should take non-relativistic limit, leading to sqrt(m_p/m_e)⇒ answer≈42.85.

But then original electron wavelength in non-rel terms is h / sqrt(2 m_e K), proton is h / sqrt(2 m_p K). So ratio is sqrt(m_p/m_e). Thus, resolution is increased by sqrt(m_p/m_e) times. Thus this seems to be the required answer.

Alternatively, if the proton accelerated with the same speed as the electron : different reasoning. But problem states they start from zero.

Wait no, replaced with proton beam, same acceleration condition: not same speed. Ah, problem states replacing the beam. So changing particles but same accelerating potential. Then, as assumed.

Since the conclusion from non-relativistic approach is that resulting wavelengths are inversely proportional to sqrt(mass). Therefore, to get the ratio of resolving powers (i.e., resolution improve factor): sqrt(m_p/m_e). Now, calculate sqrt(m_p/m_e) ⇒ m_p c2=938 MeV and m_e c2=0.511 MeV, so ratio m_p/m_e=(938×10^6 eV)/(0.511×10^6 eV)=938/0.511≈1835; thus, sqrt(1835)=42.85.

Hence, the resolving power would increase by≈42.85 times.

But in the example before we computed using same kinetic energy (as Rest energy of electron ≈0.511 MeV) resulted in factor of≈35 times higher resolution. Hence, different results, so depends on kinetic energy. Hence, without the accelerating voltage given, the problem likely expects a nonrelativistic treatment.

Alternatively maybe electrons are used at high accelerating voltage so Relativistic. If so, even more involved. Hence,  perhaps the answer should just be sqrt(m_p/m_e). since they give us rest energies, which determines mass ratios.

Thus, m_p/m_e=E_p/(E_e)= (938 MeV)/(0.511 MeV)=1836. sqrt(1836)=≈42.85. So resolving power increases by a factor of≈42.85.

**Final Answer**
The resolving power of the microscope would increase by a factor of \boxed{43}.

<definition>The ability to select and apply appropriate formulas, equations, and principles to solve a specific problem, including knowing when and how to use relativistic vs. non-relativistic approaches.</definition>

<start>1934</start>
<end>2444</end>
<text>To find p, we can use the relation between kinetic energy (K) and momentum. However, if the particles are accelerated through a potential V, their kinetic energy K is equal to eV (if we're using non-relativistic speeds, which is probably the case since electrons in electron microscopes are often at high speeds but maybe still non-relativistic? Hmm, but given that the rest energy of an electron is 511 keV, if the accelerating voltage is, say, 100 kV, that's 100 keV, which is a significant fraction of the rest energy, so maybe we have to consider relativistic effects.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates strategic knowledge by considering whether to use relativistic or non-relativistic equations based on the energy scales involved. They recognize that when the kinetic energy approaches a significant fraction of the rest energy, relativistic effects become important.</explanation>

<start>4026</start>
<end>4494</end>
<text>Wait, perhaps it's best to use the general formula for the de Broglie wavelength in terms of the kinetic energy, regardless of relativistic effects. So to compute the wavelength given any kinetic energy, we'd need to use the relativistic relation between kinetic energy and momentum.

The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E2 = (pc)2 + (m c2)2. Here E is the total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy). So, E = K + m c2.</text>
<explanation>The solver strategically decides to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation to handle all possible energy regimes. This shows sophisticated knowledge application by choosing a general approach that works regardless of whether the particles are relativistic or not.</explanation>

<start>4494</start>
<end>4762</end>
<text>Therefore, (K + m c2)2 = (pc)2 + (m c2)2

Expanding:

K2 + 2 K m c2 + m2 c^4 = p2 c2 + m2 c^4

Cancels m2 c^4:

K2 + 2 K m c2 = p2 c2

Thus, pc = sqrt(K2 + 2 K m c2)

Then, p = sqrt(K2 + 2 K m c2)/c</text>
<explanation>The solver correctly manipulates the relativistic energy-momentum equation to derive an expression for momentum in terms of kinetic energy and rest mass. This demonstrates strategic knowledge application through mathematical derivation.</explanation>

<skill>Metacognitive Monitoring</skill>
<definition>The ability to reflect on one's own thinking process, identify gaps in understanding, recognize errors, and adjust problem-solving strategies accordingly.</definition>

<start>2444</start>
<end>2681</end>
<text>However, the problem says "Assume that the resolving power ... depends only on the wave properties of the particles", so perhaps it just wants us to compare their wavelengths regardless of speed considerations, but given the rest energies are provided, maybe a relativistic calculation is necessary.</text>
<explanation>The solver is monitoring their own understanding of the problem statement, questioning their approach, and considering alternative interpretations. This demonstrates metacognitive awareness of their reasoning process.</explanation>

<start>3337</start>
<end>3531</end>
<text>But wait, that contradicts with my initial thought. Wait, no. Wait, no, because if you replace electrons (small mass) with protons (large mass), if we accelerate them through the same potential, then their kinetic energies are the same but their momentum is higher for protons, so wavelength is smaller, hence higher resolution.</text>
<explanation>The solver notices a potential contradiction in their reasoning, pauses to reconsider, and then resolves the contradiction. This shows active metacognitive monitoring of their problem-solving process.</explanation>

<start>5809</start>
<end>6114</end>
<text>But without specific accelerating voltage, but given that the rest energies are provided, I think the problem might assume that the kinetic energy is the same, so we can compute ratio lambda_p / lambda_e by comparing for same K.

But let's proceed.

If kinetic energy is K=eV for both.

Thus:

lambda_e = h c / sqrt( K2 + 2 K m_e c2 )

lambda_p = h c / sqrt( K2 + 2 K m_p c2 )</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes the ambiguity in the problem statement regarding the accelerating voltage, but makes a reasonable assumption to proceed. This shows metacognitive awareness of the limitations of the given information and the need to make justified assumptions.</explanation>

<skill>Quantitative Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to work with numerical values, perform calculations, and manipulate equations to derive quantitative results.</definition>

<start>3531</start>
<end>3774</end>
<text>But here's the problem: in electron microscopes, the electrons are accelerated through a known potential, which gives them kinetic energy. So if replacing electrons with protons accelerated through the same potential, you get higher momentum (because of higher mass), hence shorter wavelength, so better resolution.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates quantitative reasoning by correctly identifying the causal chain: same potential → same kinetic energy → different momentum (due to mass difference) → different wavelength → different resolution. This shows the ability to reason through quantitative relationships.</explanation>

<start>7429</start>
<end>7773</end>
<text>For example, if the accelerating voltage is such that K=1 keV.

So for electron, K=1 keV=0.001 MeV, which is about 0.001 / 0.511 ≈ 0.2% of rest energy. So non-relativistic. Then 2 K m_e c2=2*(0.001 MeV)*(0.511 MeV) ≈ 0.001022 (MeV)^2. Whereas K2 = (0.001 MeV)^2 =1e-6 (MeV)^2. So 2 K m_e c2 >> K2.</text>
<explanation>The solver performs numerical calculations to determine whether relativistic effects are significant, comparing the magnitudes of different terms in the energy equation. This demonstrates quantitative reasoning through numerical estimation and comparison.</explanation>

<start>10927</start>
<end>11294</end>
<text>But the non-relativistic assumption (when K is much less than rest energy for proton) would give≈sqrt(m_p/m_e)=sqrt(938/0.511)=sqrt(1835≈42.85). However, in our calculation with K=0.511 MeV (which is close to electron's Rest energy but much smaller than proton's rest energy), getting≅35x.

Wait, that's slightly different from the non-relativistic result. Hence, to get precise answer we need to know the potential V.</text>
<explanation>The solver compares the results from different calculation approaches (relativistic vs. non-relativistic) and notices a discrepancy. This shows quantitative reasoning through numerical comparison and evaluation of different mathematical models.</explanation>

<skill>Problem Reformulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to restate or reframe a problem in alternative terms that facilitate solution, including identifying key variables and relationships.</definition>

<start>5174</start>
<end>5427</end>
<text>If 2 K m c2 >> K2, then pc = sqrt( K2 + 2 K m c2 ) ≈ sqrt(2 K m c2 ), so p ≈ sqrt(2 K m c2 ) / c.

Hence, lambda = h/p ≈ h c / sqrt( 2 K m c2 ) = h / sqrt( 2 K m )

Which is same as non-relativistic formula where K = (1/2) m v2, so that p = m v = sqrt( 2 m K )</text>
<explanation>The solver reformulates the relativistic equation to show that in the limit where kinetic energy is much less than rest energy, it reduces to the non-relativistic formula. This demonstrates the ability to reframe the problem in terms that simplify the solution approach.</explanation>

<start>6114</start>
<end>6354</end>
<text>Thus, the ratio (lambda_p)/(lambda_e) = sqrt( (K2 + 2 K m_e c2) / (K2 + 2 K m_p c2 ) )

Then, the resolving power is inversely proportional to wavelength. Therefore, resolving_power_p / resolving_power_e = lambda_e / lambda_p = sqrt( (K2 + 2 K m_p c2 ) / (K2 + 2 K m_e c2) )</text>
<explanation>The solver reformulates the problem in terms of the ratio of wavelengths and then the ratio of resolving powers, recognizing that resolving power is inversely proportional to wavelength. This shows the ability to reframe the problem to focus on the key relationship needed for the solution.</explanation>

<start>6354</start>
<end>6599</end>
<text>Now, simplifying this expression:

Let me define x = K / (m_e c2), or rather, x = K / (m_p c2)

Wait, perhaps not, but maybe express in terms of K / (m_e c2). Let's parameterize K as a multiple of m_e c2 and m_p c2. Let's denote that the problem gives both rest energies as m_e c2=511 keV and m_p c2=938 MeV.</text>
<explanation>The solver attempts to reformulate the problem by introducing dimensionless parameters to simplify the expressions. This shows sophisticated problem reformulation skills, even though they ultimately decide on a different approach.</explanation>

<skill>Hypothesis Testing</skill>
<definition>The ability to propose potential solutions or approaches, test them against the problem constraints, and evaluate their validity.</definition>

<start>8422</start>
<end>8857</end>
<text>So for electron:

E = K + m_e c2= 0.511 MeV +0.511 MeV=1.022 MeV.

Momentum pc= sqrt( (E)^2 - (m_e c2)^2 )=sqrt(1.0222 -0.5112) MeV=√(1.044 -0.261)=sqrt(0.783)=approx 0.884 MeV.

Then lambda_e= h c / (pc)= (12.4 keV·Å) / (0.884 MeV). Hmm, maybe impractical to calculate actual numbers.

Alternatively, use formula:

lambda_e= h c / sqrt( K^2 + 2 K m_e c2 )</text>
<explanation>The solver tests a specific approach to calculating the electron wavelength, finds it cumbersome, and then proposes an alternative formulation. This demonstrates hypothesis testing through trying different calculation methods and evaluating their practicality.</explanation>

<start>11294</start>
<end>11719</end>
<text>Wait, that's slightly different from the non-relativistic result. Hence, to get precise answer we need to know the potential V.

However, the problem might Assume in general that we can use the nonrelativistic formula. Because it didn't specify the acceleration voltage. Given that since the problem is for an olympiad, probably students are expected to use non-relativistic expressions. So I think the key factor here is whether to use relativistic equations or not. But perhaps, given that the problem provides rest energies, we need to use relativistic equations.</text>
<explanation>The solver hypothesizes about what the problem might be expecting, considering both relativistic and non-relativistic approaches, and evaluating them against the context of the problem (an olympiad) and the provided information (rest energies). This shows hypothesis testing through considering alternative interpretations of the problem.</explanation>

<start>11719</start>
<end>12133</end>
<text>Alternatively, it might be expecting a rest mass ratio answer where the resolving power scaling is 1/sqrt(m_p/m_e). Wait, no—the above result computed 35 times improvement, which is lower than the non-relativistic result of≈42.8.

But in the absence of specific information about accelerating voltage, the safest assumption is that we are to use the rest energies and voltage such that K is equal to m_e c2. Or not. Alternatively, perhaps in the absence of specific data, we should take non-relativistic limit, leading to sqrt(m_p/m_e)⇒ answer≈42.85.</text>
<explanation>The solver tests multiple hypotheses about what the problem might be asking for, evaluating each against the constraints and information provided. This demonstrates hypothesis testing through systematic consideration of different possible interpretations and approaches.</explanation>
