<explanation>The solver has provided the correct answer of 1.4 standard deviations, which demonstrates understanding of the relationship between standard deviations and the proportion of data in a distribution. This shows statistical reasoning because it requires knowledge of how probability distributions work and how standard deviations relate to data concentration around the mean.</explanation>

<explanation>The answer of 1.4 standard deviations indicates knowledge of probability distributions. Specifically, the solver knows that in a normal distribution, approximately 50% of data falls above the mean, so to capture at least 50% of all data, one would need to go a certain number of standard deviations below the mean. The value 1.4 is the correct distance that ensures at least 50% of data is included when measuring from the mean in one direction.</explanation>

<text>1.4</text>
<explanation>To arrive at the answer of 1.4, the solver must have applied knowledge of the standard normal distribution table or formula. This value corresponds to approximately 91.9% of data in one tail of a normal distribution, which means about 8.1% in the other tail. Since 50% + 41.9% = 91.9%, this ensures that at least 50% of the data is captured when going 1.4 standard deviations from the mean.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver demonstrates understanding that standard deviation is a unit of measurement for distance from the mean in a distribution. By providing 1.4 as the answer, they show they understand that standard deviations can be used to determine what proportion of data falls within certain ranges from the mean.</explanation>
