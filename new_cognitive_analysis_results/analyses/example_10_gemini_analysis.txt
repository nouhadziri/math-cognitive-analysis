Problem:
Consider the following two person game. A number of pebbles are situated on the table. Two players make their moves alternately. A move consists of taking off the table  $x$  pebbles where  $x$  is the square of any positive integer. The player who is unable to make a move loses. Prove that there are infinitely many initial situations in which the second player can win no matter how his opponent plays.

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let $N$ be the initial number of pebbles.
The possible moves are to subtract $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \dots$ pebbles. So we can subtract 1, 4, 9, 16, ... pebbles.
The player who cannot make a move loses. This means the player who faces 0 pebbles wins.
This is a variation of the game of Nim. We can analyze the winning and losing positions.
A position is a losing position if every move from this position leads to a winning position for the opponent.
A position is a winning position if there is at least one move to a losing position for the opponent.
0 is a losing position (L).
1 can move to 0, so 1 is a winning position (W).
2 can move to 1, so 2 is a winning position (W).
3 can move to 2, so 3 is a winning position (W).
4 can move to 3 (W) or 0 (L), so 4 is a winning position (W).
5 can move to 4 (W) or 1 (W), so 5 is a winning position (W).
6 can move to 5 (W) or 2 (W), so 6 is a winning position (W).
7 can move to 6 (W) or 3 (W), so 7 is a winning position (W).
8 can move to 7 (W) or 4 (W), so 8 is a winning position (W).
9 can move to 8 (W) or 5 (W) or 0 (L), so 9 is a winning position (W).
10 can move to 9 (W) or 6 (W) or 1 (W), so 10 is a winning position (W).
11 can move to 10 (W) or 7 (W) or 2 (W), so 11 is a winning position (W).
12 can move to 11 (W) or 8 (W) or 3 (W), so 12 is a winning position (W).
13 can move to 12 (W) or 9 (W) or 4 (W), so 13 is a winning position (W).
14 can move to 13 (W) or 10 (W) or 5 (W), so 14 is a winning position (W).
15 can move to 14 (W) or 11 (W) or 6 (W), so 15 is a winning position (W).
16 can move to 15 (W) or 12 (W) or 7 (W) or 0 (L), so 16 is a winning position (W).
17 can move to 16 (W) or 13 (W) or 8 (W) or 1 (W), so 17 is a winning position (W).

Let $L$ be the set of losing positions and $W$ be the set of winning positions.
$0 \in L$
If $n \in W$, then there exists a move from $n$ to $m \in L$.
If for all possible moves from $n$, the resulting position $m \in W$, then $n \in L$.

Consider the Sprague-Grundy theorem. The nim-value of a game position is the mex (minimum excluded value) of the nim-values of the positions reachable from the current position.
Let $g(n)$ be the nim-value of a game with $n$ pebbles.
$g(0) = 0$

If the nim-value is 0, it's a losing position.
The losing positions are where $g(n) = 0$.
The losing positions we found are 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 34, ...
We need to show that there are infinitely many losing positions.

Consider the case when the moves are only taking 1 pebble. Then the losing positions are the even numbers.
Consider the case when the moves are taking 1 or 2 pebbles. The losing positions are multiples of 3.
Consider the case when the moves are taking 1 or 4 pebbles.
Losing positions are $n$ such that $g(n)=0$.
If $g(n)=0$, then for any move $n \to n-k^2$, $g(n-k^2) \ne 0$.
If $g(n) \ne 0$, then there exists a move $n \to n-k^2$ such that $g(n-k^2) = 0$.

Consider a large number of pebbles $N$. We want to find if there are infinitely many $N$ such that $g(N)=0$.
If $g(N)=0$, then for all $k$, $g(N-k^2) \ne 0$.
If the second player can win, the initial position is a losing position, so $g(N)=0$.

Consider the pattern of losing positions.
0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 34
Differences between consecutive losing positions: 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 12

Let's consider a number of the form $m^2 - 1$.
$g(m^2-1) = \text{mex} \{ g(m^2-1-k^2) \}$
If $m^2-1$ is a losing position, then for all $k$, $g(m^2-1-k^2) \ne 0$.

Consider the game modulo some number.
Consider the case where the only move is to subtract 1. The losing positions are $0 \pmod 2$.
Consider the case where the moves are to subtract 1 or 4.
$g(n) = \text{mex} \{ g(n-1), g(n-4) \}$
$g(0)=0$
$g(1)=1$
$g(2)=0$
$g(3)=1$
$g(4)=2$
$g(5)=0$
$g(6)=1$
$g(7)=0$
$g(8)=2$
$g(9)=3$
$g(10)=0$

Consider a large integer $N$. Suppose $N \equiv 2 \pmod 3$.
Possible moves are $1 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, $4 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, $9 \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $16 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$.
The moves are $\equiv 0, 1 \pmod 3$.
If $N \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, moves to $N-1 \equiv 2 \pmod 3$ or $N-0 \equiv 0 \pmod 3$.
If $N \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, moves to $N-1 \equiv 0 \pmod 3$ or $N-0 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$.
If $N \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, moves to $N-1 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ or $N-0 \equiv 2 \pmod 3$.

Consider the losing positions. If $n$ is a losing position, then for any square $k^2$, $n-k^2$ is a winning position.
We want to show there are infinitely many losing positions.
Suppose there are finitely many losing positions $l_1, l_2, \dots, l_m$.
Consider a number $L > \max(l_i)$.
If $L$ is a losing position, we have a contradiction.
If $L$ is a winning position, there exists a move $L-k^2 = l_i$ for some $i$.
So $L = l_i + k^2$.

Consider the pattern of nim-values again:
0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 0

Consider the losing positions modulo some number.
0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 34
mod 3: 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1
mod 4: 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 2, 2
mod 5: 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 4

Consider the numbers of the form $4k+2$.
$g(2)=0$, $g(6)=1$, $g(10)=0$, $g(14)=2$, $g(18)=1$, $g(22)=0$.
It seems that $4k+2$ are sometimes losing positions.

Let $S$ be the set of losing positions. We know $0 \in S$.
If $n \in S$, then for all positive integers $k$, $n+k^2 \notin S$.
If $n \notin S$, then there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $n-k^2 \in S$.

Consider the sequence of losing positions $a_n$.
$a_1=0, a_2=2, a_3=5, a_4=7, a_5=10, a_6=12, a_7=15, a_8=17, a_9=20, a_{10}=22, a_{11}=34$.
Consider the differences $d_n = a_{n+1} - a_n$: 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 12.
It seems that for large enough $n$, the difference is 2 or 3.

Consider a position $n$. If $n-1, n-4, n-9, \dots$ are all winning positions, then $n$ is a losing position.
If a position $m$ is a winning position, then there exists a move $m-k^2$ that is a losing position.

Consider numbers of the form $4^k \times m$, where $m \in \{2, 3\}$.
Consider numbers of the form $4k+2$.
We have seen that 2, 10, 22 are losing positions.
Consider $g(4k+2)$.
$g(2)=0$
$g(6)=1$
$g(10)=0$
$g(14)=2$
$g(18)=1$
$g(22)=0$
$g(26)=2$
$g(30)=3$
$g(34)=0$
$g(38)=1$
$g(42)=0$
$g(46)=2$
$g(50)=1$
$g(54)=0$

It seems that numbers of the form $4^k (4m+2)$ are losing positions.
Let's test this hypothesis.
If $n$ is a losing position, then $g(n)=0$.
If $g(n)=0$, then for all $k$, $g(n-k^2) \ne 0$.

Consider the initial situation with $4m+2$ pebbles.
Possible moves: $4m+2 - 1 = 4m+1$, $4m+2 - 4 = 4m-2$, $4m+2 - 9 = 4m-7$, $4m+2 - 16 = 4m-14$.
Consider the losing positions modulo 4: 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 2, 2.
Consider the losing positions modulo 8: 0, 2, 5, 7, 2, 4, 7, 1, 4, 6, 2.

Consider the game played on a graph. The vertices are the number of pebbles, and edges go from $n$ to $n-k^2$. The losing positions are the positions from which every move leads to a winning position.

Consider the Sprague-Grundy theorem again. A position is a losing position if and only if its nim-value is 0. We need to show that there are infinitely many $n$ such that $g(n)=0$.

Consider the pattern of differences between consecutive losing positions: 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 12.
If after some point the differences are always 2 or 3, then there are infinitely many losing positions.

Consider a large losing position $L$. Then $L+2$ or $L+3$ is potentially a losing position.
If $L$ is a losing position, then $g(L)=0$. This means for all $k$, $g(L-k^2) \ne 0$.
We need to show there are infinitely many $n$ such that for all $k$, $g(n-k^2) \ne 0$.

Consider the losing positions: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 34, 39, 41, 44, 46, 49, 51, 63, 65, 68, 70, 73, 75, 87, 90, 92, 95, 97, 109.
Differences: 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 12, 5, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 12, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 12, 3, 2, 3, 2, 12.
The differences seem to be mostly 2 or 3, with occasional 12.

Consider a large number $N$. If $N, N+2, N+5, N+7$ are losing positions.
If $n$ is a losing position, then $n+1, n+4, n+9, \dots$ are winning positions.

Consider the case of Nim with one pile. The losing positions are 0.
Consider the game of taking 1 or 2 pebbles. Losing positions are multiples of 3.

Consider the losing positions $0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 34, \dots$
Consider the numbers $4k+2$. 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, 50, 54.
Losing values: 2, 10, 22, 34, 42, 54.
Consider $4^k \times 2$: 2, 8, 32, ...
$g(2)=0$, $g(8)=1$, $g(32)=3$.

Consider the theorem by Guy and Smith (1956): In the game where players can remove $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ objects, the sequence of nim-values is periodic. However, the set of moves here is infinite.

Consider the paper by доказательство существования бесконечного числа проигрышных позиций в игре с вычитанием квадратов.
Consider numbers of the form $n = 4^k m$, where $m \in L$.
If $n$ is a losing position, the second player wins. We need to show there are infinitely many losing positions.

$g(24) = \text{mex} \{ g(23), g(20), g(15), g(8) \} = \text{mex} \{ 1, 0, 0, 1 \} = 2$
$g(25) = \text{mex} \{ g(24), g(21), g(16), g(9), g(0) \} = \text{mex} \{ 2, 1, 1, 2, 0 \} = 3$</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the Sprague-Grundy theorem to systematically calculate the nim-values for positions 0 through 25. This demonstrates methodical enumeration using a recursive formula, carefully tracking all possible moves from each position and computing the minimum excluded value (mex) to determine the nim-value.</explanation>

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify regularities, trends, or recurring structures in data or mathematical objects. This includes detecting sequences, cycles, or relationships that may not be immediately obvious.</definition>

<start>3583</start>
<end>3672</end>
<text>If the nim-value is 0, it's a losing position.
The losing positions are where $g(n) = 0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes the critical pattern that positions with nim-value 0 correspond to losing positions in the game, which is a fundamental insight from combinatorial game theory.</explanation>

<start>3672</start>
<end>3793</end>
<text>The losing positions we found are 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 34, ...
We need to show that there are infinitely many losing positions.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies the sequence of losing positions from the previous calculations and recognizes that the goal is to prove this sequence is infinite.</explanation>

<start>7533</start>
<end>7836</end>
<text>Consider the sequence of losing positions $a_n$.
$a_1=0, a_2=2, a_3=5, a_4=7, a_5=10, a_6=12, a_7=15, a_8=17, a_9=20, a_{10}=22, a_{11}=34$.
Consider the differences $d_n = a_{n+1} - a_n$: 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 12.
It seems that for large enough $n$, the difference is 2 or 3.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes the differences between consecutive losing positions, identifying a potential pattern where the differences appear to be mostly 2 or 3. This pattern recognition could lead to insights about the structure of losing positions.</explanation>

<start>9317</start>
<end>9814</end>
<text>Consider the losing positions: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 34, 39, 41, 44, 46, 49, 51, 63, 65, 68, 70, 73, 75, 87, 90, 92, 95, 97, 109.
Differences: 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 12, 5, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 12, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 12, 3, 2, 3, 2, 12.
The differences seem to be mostly 2 or 3, with occasional 12.</text>
<explanation>The solver extends the analysis of losing positions and their differences, confirming the earlier pattern that differences are primarily 2 or 3, with occasional larger jumps of 12. This pattern recognition helps in understanding the structure of losing positions.</explanation>

<skill>Application of Theoretical Frameworks</skill>
<definition>The ability to apply established mathematical theories, theorems, or frameworks to analyze and solve specific problems. This involves recognizing when a particular mathematical tool is relevant and using it appropriately.</definition>

<start>1327</start>
<end>1727</end>
<text>Consider the Sprague-Grundy theorem. The nim-value of a game position is the mex (minimum excluded value) of the nim-values of the positions reachable from the current position.
Let $g(n)$ be the nim-value of a game with $n$ pebbles.
$g(0) = 0$
$g(n) = \text{mex} \{ g(n-k^2) \mid n-k^2 \ge 0, k \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \}$</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the Sprague-Grundy theorem, a fundamental result in combinatorial game theory, to analyze the game. They correctly define the nim-value function g(n) using the mex operation and establish the recursive formula for calculating nim-values in this specific game.</explanation>

<start>7160</start>
<end>7308</end>
<text>Consider a position $n$. If $n-1, n-4, n-9, \dots$ are all winning positions, then $n$ is a losing position.
If a position $m$ is a winning position, then there exists a move $m-k^2$ that is a losing position.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the fundamental principles of impartial combinatorial games to characterize winning and losing positions. This demonstrates understanding and application of the theoretical framework underlying the analysis of such games.</explanation>

<start>9938</start>
<end>10190</end>
<text>Consider the theorem by Guy and Smith (1956): In the game where players can remove $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ objects, the sequence of nim-values is periodic. However, the set of moves here is infinite.</text>
<explanation>The solver attempts to apply a known theorem from combinatorial game theory (Guy and Smith's result on periodicity), but also recognizes its limitations in this context since the set of possible moves is infinite rather than finite.</explanation>

<skill>Modular Thinking</skill>
<definition>The ability to analyze mathematical problems by considering properties under modular arithmetic. This involves examining patterns or behaviors when numbers are considered modulo some value, which can reveal structural insights not apparent in the standard representation.</definition>

<start>4815</start>
<end>5112</end>
<text>Consider the game modulo some number.
Consider the case where the only move is to subtract 1. The losing positions are $0 \pmod 2$.
Consider the case where the moves are to subtract 1 or 4.
$g(n) = \text{mex} \{ g(n-1), g(n-4) \}$</text>
<explanation>The solver attempts to simplify the problem by considering it modulo various numbers, starting with simple cases where only certain moves are allowed. This demonstrates modular thinking as a strategy to uncover patterns.</explanation>

<start>5454</start>
<end>5805</end>
<text>Consider a large integer $N$. Suppose $N \equiv 2 \pmod 3$.
Possible moves are $1 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, $4 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, $9 \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $16 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$.
The moves are $\equiv 0, 1 \pmod 3$.
