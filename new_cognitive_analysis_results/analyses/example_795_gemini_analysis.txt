Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
The state vector is given by $|\psi> = \sqrt{1/15} |\phi_1> + \sqrt{2/15} |\phi_2> + 2/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_3> + 4/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_4>$.
The basis vectors $|\phi_n>$ are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator $H$ such that $H |\phi_n> = n E_o |\phi_n>$.
We need to calculate the average energy of the system in repeated measurements.
The average energy of the system is given by the expectation value of the Hamiltonian operator $H$, which is $\langle H \rangle = \langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle$.

First, let's find $H |\psi\rangle$:
$H |\psi> = H (\sqrt{1/15} |\phi_1> + \sqrt{2/15} |\phi_2> + 2/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_3> + 4/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_4>)$
$H |\psi> = \sqrt{1/15} H |\phi_1> + \sqrt{2/15} H |\phi_2> + 2/ \sqrt{15} H |\phi_3> + 4/ \sqrt{15} H |\phi_4>$
Using the eigenvalue equation $H |\phi_n> = n E_o |\phi_n>$:
$H |\psi> = \sqrt{1/15} (1 E_o) |\phi_1> + \sqrt{2/15} (2 E_o) |\phi_2> + 2/ \sqrt{15} (3 E_o) |\phi_3> + 4/ \sqrt{15} (4 E_o) |\phi_4>$
$H |\psi> = E_o (\sqrt{1/15} |\phi_1> + 2\sqrt{2/15} |\phi_2> + 6/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_3> + 16/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_4>)$

Next, we need to find $\langle \psi |$. Since the basis vectors are orthonormal, $\langle \phi_n | \phi_m \rangle = \delta_{nm}$. The conjugate transpose of $|\psi\rangle$ is:
$\langle \psi | = (\sqrt{1/15} \langle\phi_1| + \sqrt{2/15} \langle\phi_2| + 2/ \sqrt{15} \langle\phi_3| + 4/ \sqrt{15} \langle\phi_4|)$

Now, calculate $\langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle$:
$\langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle = (\sqrt{1/15} \langle\phi_1| + \sqrt{2/15} \langle\phi_2| + 2/ \sqrt{15} \langle\phi_3| + 4/ \sqrt{15} \langle\phi_4|) E_o (\sqrt{1/15} |\phi_1> + 2\sqrt{2/15} |\phi_2> + 6/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_3> + 16/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_4>)$
$\langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle = E_o [ (\sqrt{1/15} \langle\phi_1|) (\sqrt{1/15} |\phi_1>) + (\sqrt{2/15} \langle\phi_2|) (2\sqrt{2/15} |\phi_2>) + (2/ \sqrt{15} \langle\phi_3|) (6/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_3>) + (4/ \sqrt{15} \langle\phi_4|) (16/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_4|) ]$
Using the orthonormality condition $\langle \phi_n | \phi_m \rangle = \delta_{nm}$:
$\langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle = E_o [ (\sqrt{1/15} \times \sqrt{1/15}) \langle\phi_1|\phi_1> + (\sqrt{2/15} \times 2\sqrt{2/15}) \langle\phi_2|\phi_2> + (2/ \sqrt{15} \times 6/ \sqrt{15}) \langle\phi_3|\phi_3> + (4/ \sqrt{15} \times 16/ \sqrt{15}) \langle\phi_4|\phi_4> ]$
$\langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle = E_o [ (1/15) \times 1 + (2 \times 2/15) \times 1 + (12/15) \times 1 + (64/15) \times 1 ]$
$\langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle = E_o [ 1/15 + 4/15 + 12/15 + 64/15 ]$
$\langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle = E_o [ (1 + 4 + 12 + 64)/15 ]$
$\langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle = E_o [ 81/15 ]$
$\langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle = 81/15 E_o$

Alternatively, the probability of finding the system in the state $|\phi_n\rangle$ is given by $|c_n|^2$, where $c_n$ is the coefficient of $|\phi_n\rangle$ in the expansion of $|\psi\rangle$.
The energy of the state $|\phi_n\rangle$ is $E_n = n E_o$.
The average energy is given by $\langle E \rangle = \sum_n P_n E_n = \sum_n |c_n|^2 E_n$.

$c_1 = \sqrt{1/15} \implies |c_1|^2 = 1/15$ and $E_1 = 1 E_o$
$c_2 = \sqrt{2/15} \implies |c_2|^2 = 2/15$ and $E_2 = 2 E_o$
$c_3 = 2/\sqrt{15} \implies |c_3|^2 = (2/\sqrt{15})^2 = 4/15$ and $E_3 = 3 E_o$
$c_4 = 4/\sqrt{15} \implies |c_4|^2 = (4/\sqrt{15})^2 = 16/15$ and $E_4 = 4 E_o$

Check if the state is normalized:
$|c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2 + |c_3|^2 + |c_4|^2 = 1/15 + 2/15 + 4/15 + 16/15 = (1+2+4+16)/15 = 23/15$.
The state is not normalized. We need to normalize the state first.
Let $|\psi'> = N |\psi>$. Then $1 = \langle \psi' | \psi' \rangle = N^2 \langle \psi | \psi \rangle = N^2 (23/15)$.
So $N^2 = 15/23$, and $N = \sqrt{15/23}$.
The normalized state is $|\psi'> = \sqrt{15/23} (\sqrt{1/15} |\phi_1> + \sqrt{2/15} |\phi_2> + 2/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_3> + 4/ \sqrt{15} |\phi_4>)$.
$|\psi'> = \sqrt{1/23} |\phi_1> + \sqrt{2/23} |\phi_2> + 2/ \sqrt{23} |\phi_3> + 4/ \sqrt{23} |\phi_4>$.

Now the probabilities are:
$P_1 = |c'_1|^2 = (\sqrt{1/23})^2 = 1/23$
$P_2 = |c'_2|^2 = (\sqrt{2/23})^2 = 2/23$
$P_3 = |c'_3|^2 = (2/\sqrt{23})^2 = 4/23$
$P_4 = |c'_4|^2 = (4/\sqrt{23})^2 = 16/23$

The average energy is:
$\langle E \rangle = P_1 E_1 + P_2 E_2 + P_3 E_3 + P_4 E_4$
$\langle E \rangle = (1/23) (1 E_o) + (2/23) (2 E_o) + (4/23) (3 E_o) + (16/23) (4 E_o)$
$\langle E \rangle = E_o (1/23 + 4/23 + 12/23 + 64/23)$
$\langle E \rangle = E_o ( (1+4+12+64)/23 )$
$\langle E \rangle = E_o ( 81/23 )$

Let's re-evaluate the first method. The expectation value formula is valid even if the state is not normalized.
$\langle H \rangle = \frac{\langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle}$
We calculated $\langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle = 81/15 E_o$.
Now calculate $\langle \psi | \psi \rangle$:
$\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = |\sqrt{1/15}|^2 + |\sqrt{2/15}|^2 + |2/\sqrt{15}|^2 + |4/\sqrt{15}|^2$
$\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = 1/15 + 2/15 + 4/15 + 16/15 = 23/15$.
$\langle H \rangle = \frac{81/15 E_o}{23/15} = \frac{81}{23} E_o$.
