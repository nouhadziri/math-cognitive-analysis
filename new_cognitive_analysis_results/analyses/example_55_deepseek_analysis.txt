Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Alright, so I have this matrix A and I need to compute A raised to the 2018th power. That seems like a lot, but maybe there's a pattern or some kind of periodicity? Let's start by understanding what this matrix looks like.

First, the given matrix is:

\[
\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & -\frac{1}{2} \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{pmatrix}
\]

Hmm, the matrix is 3x3. The second row is straightforward: 0, -1, 0. So when we multiply matrices, that row will probably just stay as 0, (-1)^n, 0 when raised to the power. Let me check that. If I think about A squared, the (2,2) entry would be 0*0 + (-1)*(-1) + 0*0 = 1. But actually, no, matrix multiplication is more involved. Wait, let's not jump the gun. Let me compute A squared first manually and see if there's a pattern.

But actually, maybe it's better to look at the structure of the matrix. The first and third rows and columns seem to form a 2x2 block embedded in the 3x3 matrix. Specifically:

The (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3) entries form a 2x2 matrix:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} & \frac\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{pmatrix}
\]

Wait, this 2x2 matrix looks familiar. That's a rotation matrix, right? Because rotation matrices in 2D look like:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\ \sin \theta & \cos \theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

Comparing this to the 2x2 block, we can see that if we let cos θ = √3 / 2 and sin θ = 1/2, then θ would be 30 degrees or π/6 radians because cos(π/6) = √3/2 and sin(π/6) = 1/2. So that 2x2 block corresponds to a rotation by π/6. 

Meanwhile, the other entry in the matrix is -1 in the (2,2) position. So when we raise A to a power, maybe the 2x2 block will be rotated by multiples of π/6, and the (2,2) entry will be (-1)^n.

Therefore, the entire matrix A could represent a rotation combined with a reflection in the third dimension. Wait, because the (2,2) entry is -1. Hmm. If we think of R^3, the middle entry being -1 would flip the y-axis, right? So each multiplication by A would flip the y-coordinate and also rotate the x-z plane by π/6. So, if A is a combination of a rotation and a reflection, how does that work when raising it to a power?

Well, reflections have order 2, meaning if you do them twice, you get back to the original. But rotations can have any order. So in this case, the (2,2) entry is a reflection, which when raised to the power 2 becomes identity again. So if we compute A^2, would the (2,2) entry become 1? Yes, because (-1)^2 = 1. Meanwhile, the rotation block would be rotated by 2*(π/6) = π/3. A^3 would have rotation by π/2 and (2,2) entry (-1)^3 = -1. Wait, yeah. So essentially, every even power, the y-axis is reflected back, and the rotation angle increases. 

But angle can be additive because each multiplication by A adds a rotation. So rotating by π/6 each time. So after n multiplications, the rotation angle is n*(π/6), and the reflection in the y-component is (-1)^n. However, if we have a rotation in x-z plane and a reflection in y-axis, does the reflection affect the rotation? Wait, probably not, because they are acting on different coordinates. The reflection is along y-axis, which is orthogonal to the x-z plane. So maybe these are separate transformations that can be considered independently.

Thus, if A is a block diagonal matrix with blocks: the 2x2 rotation matrix and the 1x1 matrix [-1], then when we raise A to the power n, the result is a block diagonal matrix with the 2x2 rotation matrix raised to n and the 1x1 matrix (-1)^n. Wait, but is A actually block diagonal? Let me check.

Looking at A: the first row is [√3/2, 0, -1/2], third row is [1/2, 0, √3/2]. So these two rows only have entries in the first and third columns, and zero in the middle. The middle row is [0, -1, 0]. Similarly, the columns: first column is [√3/2, 0, 1/2], second column is [0, -1, 0], third column is [-1/2, 0, √3/2]. So yes, the middle row and middle column are separate from the others, acting on the y-axis. The first and third rows and columns form a 2x2 rotation matrix in the x-z plane. So yes, the matrix A can be seen as a block diagonal matrix composed of a 2x2 rotation matrix in the x-z plane and a 1x1 matrix (-1) acting on the y-axis. Block diagonal meaning it's diagonal with blocks, not just scalar entries.

Therefore, when we compute A^n, it's equal to the block diagonal matrix with the 2x2 rotation matrix raised to n and the 1x1 matrix (-1)^n. 

So to compute A^2018, we can handle each block separately.

First, for the 2x2 rotation matrix:

Original rotation angle θ = π/6, so rotating by π/6 each time. Raising it to the 2018th power would rotate by 2018*(π/6). Let me compute 2018 divided by 12 to see how many full rotations that is because 2π is a full rotation, so 2π corresponds to 12*(π/6) = 12 steps. So 2018 divided by 12 gives:

2018 ÷ 12 = 168.166..., so 168*12 = 2016, remainder 2. So 2018*(π/6) = (2016 + 2)*(π/6) = 2016*(π/6) + 2*(π/6) = (168*π) + (π/3). But since a rotation by 168π is equivalent to rotation by 0 (because 2π is a full rotation; 168π is 84 full rotations) So effectively, the rotation angle is just π/3.

Hence, the rotation matrix part after 2018 multiplications would be:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos(π/3) & -\sin(π/3) \\ \sin(π/3) & \cos(π/3) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & -\sqrt{3}/2 \\ \sqrt{3}/2 & 1/2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So the 2x2 block becomes that.

Meanwhile, the (2,2) entry in A^2018 is (-1)^2018 = 1 because 2018 is even. 

So putting it all together, the final A^2018 matrix should have the rotated 2x2 block in the corners, 1 in the middle, and zeros elsewhere. Let's confirm that structure.

Original positions: the (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3) entries are replaced by the rotated matrix; the middle entry is 1. So:

First row is [cos(π/3), 0, -sin(π/3)]

Third row is [sin(π/3), 0, cos(π/3)]

But in the original matrix, the third row had entries [1/2, 0, √3/2], which corresponded to sin(π/6) and cos(π/6), because the original rotation was π/6.

After rotating by π/3, cos(π/3) = 1/2, sin π/3 = √3/2.

Therefore, the first row should be [1/2, 0, -√3/2], and the third row is [√3/2, 0, 1/2], with the middle entry as 1.

Let me write that out:

\[
\mathbf{A}^{2018} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 & -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}
\]

Yep, so that looks about right. Let me check a small power first to make sure my reasoning is correct. For example, compute A^2.

Original matrix multiplied by itself:

First, (1,1) entry: (√3/2)(√3/2) + (0)(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) = (3/4) + 0 + (-1/4) = 2/4 = 1/2

(1,2) entry: (√3/2)(0) + (0)(-1) + (-1/2)(0) = 0

(1,3) entry: (√3/2)(-1/2) + (0)(0) + (-1/2)(√3/2) = (-√3/4) + (-√3/4) = -√3/2

Similarly, (2,1) entry: 0* stuff would be 0. Similarly, (2,2) is [0, -1, 0] • [0, -1, 0]^T = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1. Good. Let’s check (3,1): (1/2)(√3/2) + (0)(0) + (√3/2)(1/2) = (√3/4) + (√3/4) = √3/2

(3,3): (1/2)(-1/2) + (0)(0) + (√3/2)(√3/2) = (-1/4) + (3/4) = 2/4 = 1/2

So, indeed, A squared is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 & -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}
\]

Which is exactly the matrix I concluded for A^2018. Wait, hold on. If this is A squared, then A^2018 is the same as A squared? But that would mean the rotations cycle every certain steps?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The 2x2 rotation matrix raised to the nth power is a rotation by nθ. So θ = π/6. Therefore, for n=2018, the total angle is 3\*2018pi/6. Wait maybe that?

Wait, the rotation matrix for angle θ has order k if kθ is multiple of 2pi. Since the rotation is in the x-z plane, each multiplication by A gives an increment of θ in that plane and a reflection in the y-axis.

Wait, but if θ is 30 degrees (pi/6 radians), then the period until the rotation repeats is when nθ is a multiple of 2pi, so n*pi/6 = 2pi*k, which implies n=12k. So the rotation part has period 12. However, the reflection in the y-axis (the -1 term) is order 2, as applying it twice gives identity.

So if the reflection and rotation combined, the period of A would be the least common multiple of 12 and 2, which is 12. Thus A^12 is identity matrix? Wait, let's see.

If n is even, (-1)^n = 1. So if n = 12, which is divisible by 12, then the rotation part would have done 12 * pi/6 = 2pi, so that's a full rotation, bringing it back to identity. And nth power of the reflection would be 1. So A^12 would be the identity matrix. Therefore, every 12 multiplications, it cycles back.

Thus, 2018 divided by 12 gives remainder. Let me compute 2018 divided by 12.

12*168=2016, 2018-2016=2. So remainder 2. So A^2018 = A^(12*168 + 2) = (A^12)^168 * A^2 = Identity^168 * A^2 = A^2. So yes, as computed earlier, A^2018 is equal to A squared because the period is 12. Therefore, to answer the question, A^2018 is equal to A^2, which is the matrix with 1/2, 0, -√3/2; 0,1,0; √3/2,0,1/2.

Hence, the final answer is as above.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 & -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}}

<text>Hmm, the matrix is 3x3. The second row is straightforward: 0, -1, 0. So when we multiply matrices, that row will probably just stay as 0, (-1)^n, 0 when raised to the power. Let me check that. If I think about A squared, the (2,2) entry would be 0*0 + (-1)*(-1) + 0*0 = 1.</text>

So, if A is a combination of a rotation and a reflection, how does that work when raising it to a power?</text>
<explanation>The solver decomposes the matrix operation into two separate geometric transformations: a rotation in the x-z plane and a reflection along the y-axis. This decomposition makes it easier to understand how the matrix behaves when raised to powers.</explanation>

<start>2616</start>
<end>3015</end>
<text>Thus, if A is a block diagonal matrix with blocks: the 2x2 rotation matrix and the 1x1 matrix [-1], then when we raise A to the power n, the result is a block diagonal matrix with the 2x2 rotation matrix raised to n and the 1x1 matrix (-1)^n. Wait, but is A actually block diagonal? Let me check.

Looking at A: the first row is [√3/2, 0, -1/2], third row is [1/2, 0, √3/2]. So these two rows only have entries in the first and third columns, and zero in the middle.</text>

<text>Comparing this to the 2x2 block, we can see that if we let cos θ = √3 / 2 and sin θ = 1/2, then θ would be 30 degrees or π/6 radians because cos(π/6) = √3/2 and sin(π/6) = 1/2. So that 2x2 block corresponds to a rotation by π/6. 

Meanwhile, the other entry in the matrix is -1 in the (2,2) position. So when we raise A to a power, maybe the 2x2 block will be rotated by multiples of π/6, and the (2,2) entry will be (-1)^n.</text>
<explanation>The solver interprets the algebraic entries of the matrix in geometric terms, recognizing that the 2×2 block represents a rotation by π/6 radians and the -1 entry represents a reflection. This geometric interpretation provides intuition about how the matrix behaves when raised to powers.</explanation>

<start>2036</start>
<end>2387</end>
<text>Well, reflections have order 2, meaning if you do them twice, you get back to the original. But rotations can have any order. So in this case, the (2,2) entry is a reflection, which when raised to the power 2 becomes identity again. So if we compute A^2, would the (2,2) entry become 1? Yes, because (-1)^2 = 1. Meanwhile, the rotation block would be rotated by 2*(π/6) = π/3.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses geometric understanding of reflections and rotations to reason about what happens when the matrix is squared. They recognize that reflections have order 2 (applying twice returns to the original state) while rotations accumulate, which guides their calculation.</explanation>

<start>3547</start>
<end>3875</end>
<text>So to compute A^2018, we can handle each block separately.

First, for the 2x2 rotation matrix:

Original rotation angle θ = π/6, so rotating by π/6 each time. Raising it to the 2018th power would rotate by 2018*(π/6). Let me compute 2018 divided by 12 to see how many full rotations that is because 2π is a full rotation, so 2π corresponds to 12*(π/6) = 12 steps.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies geometric reasoning about rotations to determine how to compute a high power of the rotation matrix, understanding that after 2π radians, rotations cycle back to their starting position.</explanation>

<skill>Modular Thinking</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and utilize cyclical patterns or periodicity in mathematical operations, often involving the concept that after a certain number of iterations, a process returns to a previous state.</definition>

<start>3877</start>
<end>4303</end>
<text>So 2018 divided by 12 gives:

2018 ÷ 12 = 168.166..., so 168*12 = 2016, remainder 2. So 2018*(π/6) = (2016 + 2)*(π/6) = 2016*(π/6) + 2*(π/6) = (168*π) + (π/3). But since a rotation by 168π is equivalent to rotation by 0 (because 2π is a full rotation; 168π is 84 full rotations) So effectively, the rotation angle is just π/3.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates modular thinking by calculating the remainder when dividing 2018 by 12 (the period of rotation) and recognizing that only the remainder matters for determining the final state of the rotation matrix.</explanation>

<start>5697</start>
<end>5958</end>
<text>So the rotation part has period 12. However, the reflection in the y-axis (the -1 term) is order 2, as applying it twice gives identity.

So if the reflection and rotation combined, the period of A would be the least common multiple of 12 and 2, which is 12. Thus A^12 is identity matrix? Wait, let's see.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies the periods of both the rotation (12) and reflection (2) components, and correctly determines that the overall period of the matrix is the least common multiple of these values, which is 12. This is a sophisticated application of modular thinking.</explanation>

<start>6229</start>
<end>6462</end>
<text>Thus, 2018 divided by 12 gives remainder. Let me compute 2018 divided by 12.

12*168=2016, 2018-2016=2. So remainder 2. So A^2018 = A^(12*168 + 2) = (A^12)^168 * A^2 = Identity^168 * A^2 = A^2.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies modular arithmetic to express A^2018 in terms of the matrix period (12) and the remainder (2), concluding that A^2018 = A^2. This is a direct application of modular thinking to simplify a high-power calculation.</explanation>

<skill>Verification and Testing</skill>
<definition>The process of checking intermediate results or hypotheses by testing them with simpler cases or direct calculations to ensure correctness before proceeding.</definition>

<start>6464</start>
<end>7022</end>
<text>So yes, as computed earlier, A^2018 is equal to A squared because the period is 12. Therefore, to answer the question, A^2018 is equal to A^2, which is the matrix with 1/2, 0, -√3/2; 0,1,0; √3/2,0,1/2.

Hence, the final answer is as above.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 & -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}}</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies their conclusion by ensuring consistency between their earlier computation of A^2 and their modular arithmetic reasoning about A^2018, providing confidence in the final answer.</explanation>

<start>6012</start>
<end>6227</end>
<text>If n is even, (-1)^n = 1. So if n = 12, which is divisible by 12, then the rotation part would have done 12 * pi/6 = 2pi, so that's a full rotation, bringing it back to identity. And nth power of the reflection would be 1. So A^12 would be the identity matrix.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies their hypothesis about the periodicity of the matrix by checking what happens after 12 iterations, confirming that both the rotation and reflection components return to their original state.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to transform mathematical expressions using formal rules and operations to derive equivalent forms that are more useful for solving a problem.</definition>

<start>4305</start>
<end>4514</end>
<text>Hence, the rotation matrix part after 2018 multiplications would be:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos(π/3) & -\sin(π/3) \\ \sin(π/3) & \cos(π/3) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & -\sqrt{3}/2 \\ \sqrt{3}/2 & 1/2 \end{pmatrix}
\]</text>
<explanation>The solver applies algebraic manipulation to compute the rotation matrix for angle π/3, substituting the values of trigonometric functions and expressing the result in exact form.</explanation>

<start>4516</start>
<end>4687</end>
<text>So the 2x2 block becomes that.

Meanwhile, the (2,2) entry in A^2018 is (-1)^2018 = 1 because 2018 is even. 

So putting it all together, the final A^2018 matrix should have the rotated 2x2 block in the corners, 1 in the middle, and zeros elsewhere.</text>
<explanation>The solver manipulates the algebraic expression (-1)^2018 by recognizing that 2018 is even, and then combines this with the rotation matrix calculation to construct the complete solution.</explanation>
