Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let $T = \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g)$.
We are given that the restriction of $T$ to $W$, denoted by $T|_W$, is injective.
We need to prove that the subspace spanned by the subspaces $\rho(g)W$ for $g \in G$ is the direct sum of these subspaces.

Let $U = \langle \rho(g)W \mid g \in G \rangle$. We need to show that the sum $\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g)W$ is a direct sum.
This means that if we have a sum $\sum_{i=1}^n v_{g_i} = 0$, where $v_{g_i} \in \rho(g_i)W$, then $v_{g_i} = 0$ for all $i$.
Equivalently, if we have a relation $\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i = 0$, where $w_i \in W$ and $g_i \in G$ are distinct, then $w_i = 0$ for all $i$.

Consider the case where $G = \{e, h\}$ is a group of order $p$.
Then $T = \rho(e) + \rho(h) = I + \rho(h)$.
The subspace spanned is $W + \rho(h)W$. We need to show that $W \cap \rho(h)W = \{0\}$.
Suppose $w = \rho(h)w'$ for some $w, w' \in W$.
Then $(I + \rho(h))(w - w') = w + \rho(h)w - w' - \rho(h)w' = w + w - w' - w = w - w'$.
If $T|_W$ is injective, then $Tw = 0$ implies $w=0$.
We have $T(w') = w' + \rho(h)w'$.
If $w \in W \cap \rho(h)W$, then $w = \rho(h)w'$ for some $w' \in W$.
Consider the sum $\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g)w = Tw$. Since $T|_W$ is injective, if $Tw = 0$, then $w = 0$.

Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Consider the element $\sum_{h \in H} \rho(h)$.
Let $U = \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g)W$.
Suppose we have a non-trivial linear dependence, say $\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i = 0$, where $g_i$ are distinct and $w_i \in W$, not all zero.
Multiply by $\rho(g^{-1})$ for some $g \in G$. Then $\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g^{-1}g_i) w_i = 0$.

Consider the action of $G$ on the set of subspaces $\{\rho(g)W \mid g \in G\}$ by left multiplication.
Let $K$ be the kernel of the restriction of $T$ to $U = \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g)W$.
If $\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) (\sum_{h \in G} \rho(h) w_h) = 0$, where $w_h \in W$.

Let's assume the sum is not direct. Then there exists $g_1, \dots, g_n \in G$ distinct, and $w_1, \dots, w_n \in W$ not all zero, such that $\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i = 0$.
Without loss of generality, assume $g_1 = e$. Then $w_1 + \sum_{i=2}^n \rho(g_i) w_i = 0$, so $w_1 = - \sum_{i=2}^n \rho(g_i) w_i \in W \cap \sum_{i=2}^n \rho(g_i)W'$.

Let $0 \neq u \in \rho(g_1)W \cap \sum_{i=2}^n \rho(g_i)W$.
Then $u = \rho(g_1) w_1 = \sum_{i=2}^n \rho(g_i) w_i'$ for some $w_1, w_i' \in W$.
$\rho(g_1) w_1 - \sum_{i=2}^n \rho(g_i) w_i' = 0$.

Let $T = \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g)$. We are given that $T|_W$ is injective.
Consider a relation $\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i = 0$, where $g_i$ are distinct.
Apply $T$: $\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) (\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i) = 0$.
$\sum_{g \in G} \sum_{i=1}^n \rho(gg_i) w_i = 0$.
For a fixed $g_j$, the terms where $gg_i = g_j$ as $g$ varies over $G$ gives $\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_j) w_i$.

Let the sum be not direct. Then there exist distinct $g_1, \dots, g_n \in G$ and $0 \neq w_i \in W$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i = 0$.
Multiply by $\rho(g_1^{-1})$: $w_1 + \sum_{i=2}^n \rho(g_1^{-1}g_i) w_i = 0$.
Let $h_i = g_1^{-1}g_i$. Then $h_1 = e$. $w_1 + \sum_{i=2}^n \rho(h_i) w_i = 0$.
Apply $T$: $T(w_1 + \sum_{i=2}^n \rho(h_i) w_i) = 0$.
$\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) (w_1 + \sum_{i=2}^n \rho(h_i) w_i) = 0$.
$\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w_1 + \sum_{g \in G} \sum_{i=2}^n \rho(gh_i) w_i = 0$.
$\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w_1 + \sum_{i=2}^n \sum_{g \in G} \rho(gh_i) w_i = 0$.
$\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w_1 + \sum_{i=2}^n (\sum_{k \in G} \rho(k)) w_i = 0$.
$Tw_1 + \sum_{i=2}^n Tw_i = 0$.
$T(w_1 + w_2 + \dots + w_n) = 0$.
Since $T|_W$ is injective, $w_1 + w_2 + \dots + w_n = 0$.

Let $U_k = \sum_{i=1}^k \rho(g_i)W$. Suppose $U_{k-1}$ is a direct sum.
Consider $\rho(g_k)W \cap \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \rho(g_i)W \neq \{0\}$.
Then $\rho(g_k)w_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \rho(g_i)w_i'$ for some $w_k, w_i' \in W$, not all zero.
$\rho(g_k)w_k - \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \rho(g_i)w_i' = 0$.
$\rho(g_k)w_k + \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \rho(g_i)(-w_i') = 0$.
This is a relation of the form we considered.

Consider the element $N = \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g)$.
Given that $N|_W$ is injective.
Suppose $\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i = 0$ for distinct $g_i$ and $w_i \in W$.
Apply $N$: $\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) (\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i) = 0$.
$\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{g \in G} \rho(gg_i) w_i = 0$.
$\sum_{i=1}^n N w_i = 0$.
Since $N|_W$ is injective, $w_i = 0$ for all $i$.

We need to show that the sum $\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g)W$ is a direct sum.
Consider a finite linear combination of elements from these subspaces that sums to zero:
$\sum_{i=1}^n v_i = 0$, where $v_i \in \rho(g_i)W$ for distinct $g_i \in G$.
Then $v_i = \rho(g_i) w_i$ for some $w_i \in W$.
So, $\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i = 0$.
Apply the linear map $T = \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g)$:
$T(\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i) = 0$.
$\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) (\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i) = 0$.
$\sum_{g \in G} \sum_{i=1}^n \rho(gg_i) w_i = 0$.
Rearrange the terms by letting $h = gg_i$, so $g = hg_i^{-1}$. As $g$ runs over $G$, $h$ also runs over $G$.
$\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{h \in G} \rho(h) w_i = 0$.
$\sum_{i=1}^n (\sum_{h \in G} \rho(h)) w_i = 0$.
$\sum_{i=1}^n T w_i = 0$.
$T w_1 + T w_2 + \dots + T w_n = 0$.
$T(w_1 + w_2 + \dots + w_n) = 0$.
Since $T|_W$ is injective and $w_1 + \dots + w_n \in W$, we have $w_1 + w_2 + \dots + w_n = 0$.

This doesn't directly imply that $w_i = 0$.

Consider the case where the subspaces $\rho(g)W$ are not distinct.
If $\rho(g_1)W = \rho(g_2)W$, then $\rho(g_2^{-1}g_1)W = W$.

Let the subspaces spanned by $\rho(g)W$ be not a direct sum.
Then there exists a non-trivial linear dependence: $\sum_{i=1}^n v_i = 0$, where $0 \neq v_i \in \rho(g_i)W$ and $g_i$ are distinct.
$v_i = \rho(g_i) w_i$ for some $w_i \in W$.
$\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i = 0$, where not all $w_i$ are zero.
Without loss of generality, assume $w_1 \neq 0$.
Apply $T$: $\sum_{i=1}^n T w_i = 0$.
$T(w_1 + \dots + w_n) = 0$.
Since $T|_W$ is injective, $w_1 + \dots + w_n = 0$.

Consider the element $0 \neq v_1 = - \sum_{i=2}^n v_i = - \sum_{i=2}^n \rho(g_i) w_i$.
$v_1 = \rho(g_1) w_1$.
$\rho(g_1) w_1 = - \rho(g_2) w_2 - \dots - \rho(g_n) w_n$.
$\rho(g_1) w_1 + \rho(g_2) w_2 + \dots + \rho(g_n) w_n = 0$.

Let $U = \langle \rho(g)W \mid g \in G \rangle$.
Consider the map $\phi: \bigoplus_{g \in G} \rho(g)W \to U$ defined by $\phi((v_g)_{g \in G}) = \sum_{g \in G} v_g$.
We want to show that $\phi$ is an isomorphism, which means the kernel is zero.
An element in the kernel is $(v_g)_{g \in G}$ such that $\sum_{g \in G} v_g = 0$.
$v_g = \rho(g) w_g$ for some $w_g \in W$.
$\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w_g = 0$.
Apply $T$: $\sum_{h \in G} \rho(h) (\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w_g) = 0$.
$\sum_{g \in G} (\sum_{h \in G} \rho(hg)) w_g = 0$.
$\sum_{g \in G} T w_g = 0$.
$T(\sum_{g \in G} w_g) = 0$.
Since $T|_W$ is injective and $\sum_{g \in G} w_g \in W$ (since $W$ is a subspace), we have $\sum_{g \in G} w_g = 0$.

We have $\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w_g = 0$.
Let $S$ be a subset of $G$. Suppose $\sum_{g \in S} \rho(g) w_g = 0$ with $w_g \in W$.
Apply $T$: $T(\sum_{g \in S} \rho(g) w_g) = 0$.
$\sum_{h \in G} \rho(h) (\sum_{g \in S} \rho(g) w_g) = 0$.
$\sum_{g \in S} (\sum_{h \in G} \rho(hg)) w_g = 0$.
$\sum_{g \in S} T w_g = 0$.
$T(\sum_{g \in S} w_g) = 0$.
Since $T|_W$ is injective, $\sum_{g \in S} w_g = 0$.

Consider the expression $\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w_g = 0$.
Let $H$ be the subgroup generated by the elements $g$ for which $w_g \neq 0$.
If $H = \{e\}$, then $\rho(e) w_e = 0$, so $w_e = 0$.

Let the sum be not direct. Then there exist distinct $g_1, \dots, g_n$ and $0 \neq w_i \in W$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i = 0$.
Consider the minimal such relation in terms of the number of non-zero $w_i$.
Without loss of generality, assume all $w_i \neq 0$.
Apply $T$: $\sum_{i=1}^n T w_i = 0$.
$T(w_1 + \dots + w_n) = 0$.
Since $T|_W$ is injective, $w_1 + \dots + w_n = 0$.

If the sum is not direct, then there exists a non-trivial relation $\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i = 0$ with distinct $g_i$ and $w_i \in W$, not all zero.
Let $0 \neq \sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i = 0$.
Multiply by $\rho(g_1^{-1})$: $w_1 + \rho(g_1^{-1}g_2) w_2 + \dots + \rho(g_1^{-1}g_n) w_n = 0$.
Let $h_i = g_1^{-1}g_i$, so $h_1 = e$.
$w_1 + \rho(h_2) w_2 + \dots + \rho(h_n) w_n = 0$.
Apply $T$: $T(w_1 + \rho(h_2) w_2 + \dots + \rho(h_n) w_n) = 0$.
$Tw_1 + T\rho(h_2) w_2 + \dots + T\rho(h_n) w_n = 0$.
$\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) w_1 + \sum_{g \in G} \rho(gh_2) w_2 + \dots + \sum_{g \in G} \rho(gh_n) w_n = 0$.
$Tw_1 + Tw_2 + \dots + Tw_n = 0$.
$T(w_1 + w_2 + \dots + w_n) = 0$.
Since $T|_W$ is injective, $w_1 + w_2 + \dots + w_n = 0$.

Consider a finite linear combination of elements from these subspaces that sums to zero:
$\sum_{i=1}^n v_i = 0$, where $v_i \in \rho(g_i)W$ for distinct $g_i \in G$.
Then $v_i = \rho(g_i) w_i$ for some $w_i \in W$.
So, $\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(g_i) w_i = 0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver chooses a direct approach to prove the direct sum property by considering a linear combination that equals zero and showing all coefficients must be zero. This is a standard strategy for proving linear independence.</explanation>

$\sum_{i=1}^n (\sum_{h \in G} \rho(h)) w_i = 0$.
$\sum_{i=1}^n T w_i = 0$.
$T w_1 + T w_2 + \dots + T w_n = 0$.
$T(w_1 + w_2 + \dots + w_n) = 0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver performs a sophisticated change of variables (h = gg_i) and rearranges the nested summations to isolate T applied to each w_i. This algebraic manipulation transforms the complex expression into a form where the injectivity of T|_W can be directly applied.</explanation>

$w_1 + \rho(h_2) w_2 + \dots + \rho(h_n) w_n = 0$.</text>
