Problem:
Jenny and Kenny are walking in the same direction, Kenny at 3 feet per second and Jenny at 1 foot per second, on parallel paths that are 200 feet apart. A tall circular building 100 feet in diameter is centered midway between the paths. At the instant when the building first blocks the line of sight between Jenny and Kenny, they are 200 feet apart. Let $t\,$ be the amount of time, in seconds, before Jenny and Kenny can see each other again. If $t\,$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the duration of the time interval during which the circular building blocks the line of sight between Jenny and Kenny. We need to determine the positions of Jenny and Kenny as functions of time and then find the times when the line segment connecting them intersects the building.

Let the parallel paths be along the y-axis. We can set up a coordinate system where the paths are at $x = 100$ and $x = -100$. Let Jenny's path be $x = -100$ and Kenny's path be $x = 100$. The center of the circular building is at the origin $(0, 0)$. The radius of the building is $100/2 = 50$ feet. The equation of the building is $x^2 + y^2 = 50^2 = 2500$.

Let the positions of Jenny and Kenny at time $\tau$ be $J(\tau) = (-100, y_J(\tau))$ and $K(\tau) = (100, y_K(\tau))$. Since they are moving in the same direction, let that direction be along the positive y-axis.

Let the time when the building first blocks the line of sight be $\tau = 0$. At this instant, the distance between Jenny and Kenny is 200 feet.
The distance between them is $\sqrt{(100 - (-100))^2 + (y_K(0) - y_J(0))^2} = \sqrt{200^2 + (y_K(0) - y_J(0))^2}$.
We are given that this distance is 200 feet.
$200 = \sqrt{40000 + (y_K(0) - y_J(0))^2}$
$40000 = 40000 + (y_K(0) - y_J(0))^2$
$(y_K(0) - y_J(0))^2 = 0$
$y_K(0) = y_J(0)$.

Let $y_J(0) = y_K(0) = y_0$.
Jenny's speed is 1 ft/s, so $y_J(\tau) = y_0 + 1 \cdot \tau = y_0 + \tau$.
Kenny's speed is 3 ft/s, so $y_K(\tau) = y_0 + 3 \cdot \tau$.

The line segment connecting Jenny and Kenny at time $\tau$ has endpoints $(-100, y_0 + \tau)$ and $(100, y_0 + 3\tau)$.
A point $(x, y)$ on this line segment can be parameterized as:
$x = (1-\lambda) (-100) + \lambda (100) = -100 + 200\lambda$
$y = (1-\lambda) (y_0 + \tau) + \lambda (y_0 + 3\tau) = y_0 + \tau + 2\lambda \tau$
where $0 \le \lambda \le 1$.

The line of sight is blocked when this line segment intersects the building $x^2 + y^2 = 2500$.
Substitute the expressions for $x$ and $y$ into the equation of the circle:
$(-100 + 200\lambda)^2 + (y_0 + \tau + 2\lambda \tau)^2 = 2500$
$(100(2\lambda - 1))^2 + (y_0 + \tau(1 + 2\lambda))^2 = 2500$
$10000 (2\lambda - 1)^2 + (y_0 + \tau(1 + 2\lambda))^2 = 2500$

At the instant when the building first blocks the line of sight, let the time be $\tau = 0$. At this time, the line segment connecting Jenny and Kenny is tangent to the building.
At $\tau = 0$, the line segment connects $(-100, y_0)$ and $(100, y_0)$. This is a horizontal line segment from $x = -100$ to $x = 100$ at $y = y_0$.
For this line segment to be tangent to the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 2500$, we must have $|y_0| = 50$.

Case 1: $y_0 = 50$.
Case 2: $y_0 = -50$.

Consider the symmetry of the problem. If we shift the entire setup vertically, the times when the line of sight is blocked should remain the same.

Let's consider the geometry at $\tau = 0$. Jenny is at $(-100, y_0)$ and Kenny is at $(100, y_0)$. The line segment connecting them is horizontal. The building blocks the line of sight when this segment intersects the interior of the circle. The segment extends from $x = -100$ to $x = 100$. For the segment to be tangent to the circle, the y-coordinate of the segment must be $\pm 50$.

If the blocking starts at $\tau = 0$, it means the line segment is tangent to the circle at this time.

Let's use a different approach. The line passing through Jenny $(-100, y_0 + \tau)$ and Kenny $(100, y_0 + 3\tau)$ has the equation:
$\frac{y - (y_0 + \tau)}{x - (-100)} = \frac{(y_0 + 3\tau) - (y_0 + \tau)}{100 - (-100)} = \frac{2\tau}{200} = \frac{\tau}{100}$
$y - y_0 - \tau = \frac{\tau}{100} (x + 100) = \frac{\tau}{100} x + \tau$
$y = \frac{\tau}{100} x + y_0 + 2\tau$

The line of sight is blocked when this line intersects the interior of the building $x^2 + y^2 \le 2500$.
The line is tangent to the circle when the distance from the origin to the line is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 50.
The equation of the line is $\tau x - 100y + 100(y_0 + 2\tau) = 0$.
Distance from origin to the line: $\frac{|\tau(0) - 100(0) + 100(y_0 + 2\tau)|}{\sqrt{\tau^2 + (-100)^2}} = \frac{|100y_0 + 200\tau|}{\sqrt{\tau^2 + 10000}}$

The line is tangent to the circle when $\frac{|100y_0 + 200\tau|}{\sqrt{\tau^2 + 10000}} = 50$.
$(100y_0 + 200\tau)^2 = 2500 (\tau^2 + 10000)$
$10000 (y_0 + 2\tau)^2 = 2500 (\tau^2 + 10000)$
$4 (y_0 + 2\tau)^2 = \tau^2 + 10000$
$4 (y_0^2 + 4y_0\tau + 4\tau^2) = \tau^2 + 10000$
$4y_0^2 + 16y_0\tau + 16\tau^2 = \tau^2 + 10000$
$15\tau^2 + 16y_0\tau + 4y_0^2 - 10000 = 0$

This is a quadratic equation in $\tau$. The roots of this equation correspond to the times when the line of sight is tangent to the building. The interval between these times is when the line of sight is blocked.

We know that at $\tau = 0$, the line of sight is first blocked, meaning the line is tangent to the circle at $\tau = 0$.
Substituting $\tau = 0$ into the quadratic equation:
$15(0)^2 + 16y_0(0) + 4y_0^2 - 10000 = 0$
$4y_0^2 = 10000$
$y_0^2 = 2500$
$y_0 = \pm 50$.

Let's consider $y_0 = 50$. The quadratic equation becomes:
$15\tau^2 + 16(50)\tau + 4(50)^2 - 10000 = 0$
$15\tau^2 + 800\tau + 4(2500) - 10000 = 0$
$15\tau^2 + 800\tau + 10000 - 10000 = 0$
$15\tau^2 + 800\tau = 0$
$\tau (15\tau + 800) = 0$
The roots are $\tau = 0$ and $15\tau = -800$, $\tau = -\frac{800}{15} = -\frac{160 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = -\frac{160}{3}$.

Since $\tau = 0$ is the time when the blocking starts, and the other time is negative, this case does not seem correct or might need careful interpretation.

Let's consider the geometry of the situation. The relative position of Kenny with respect to Jenny is $(100 - (-100), (y_0 + 3\tau) - (y_0 + \tau)) = (200, 2\tau)$.
The line of sight is blocked when the line segment connecting Jenny and Kenny intersects the building.

Consider the movement of the midpoint of the line segment between Jenny and Kenny.
Midpoint $M(\tau) = \left( \frac{-100 + 100}{2}, \frac{(y_0 + \tau) + (y_0 + 3\tau)}{2} \right) = (0, y_0 + 2\tau)$.
The midpoint moves along the y-axis.

The line segment connecting Jenny and Kenny passes through the origin if the origin lies on the line.
$0 = \frac{\tau}{100} (0) + y_0 + 2\tau$
$y_0 + 2\tau = 0$, so $\tau = -\frac{y_0}{2}$.

If $y_0 = 50$, $\tau = -25$. If $y_0 = -50$, $\tau = 25$.

Consider the angles. The slope of the line of sight is $\frac{2\tau}{200} = \frac{\tau}{100}$.

Let's return to the condition that at $\tau = 0$, the line of sight is first blocked. This means the line segment connecting $(-100, y_0)$ and $(100, y_0)$ is tangent to the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 2500$. This occurs when $|y_0| = 50$.

Case 1: $y_0 = 50$.
The equation for the tangent times is $15\tau^2 + 800\tau = 0$, giving $\tau = 0$ and $\tau = -\frac{800}{15}$.
The interval during which the line of sight is blocked starts at $\tau = 0$. We need the next time when the line is tangent.

Case 2: $y_0 = -50$.
The quadratic equation becomes:
$15\tau^2 + 16(-50)\tau + 4(-50)^2 - 10000 = 0$
$15\tau^2 - 800\tau + 10000 - 10000 = 0$
$15\tau^2 - 800\tau = 0$
$\tau (15\tau - 800) = 0$
The roots are $\tau = 0$ and $15\tau = 800$, $\tau = \frac{800}{15} = \frac{160}{3}$.

If $y_0 = -50$, the line of sight is first blocked at $\tau = 0$. The next time the line is tangent is $\tau = \frac{160}{3}$.
The interval during which the line of sight is blocked is $0 \le \tau \le \frac{160}{3}$.
The duration of the blockage is $\frac{160}{3} - 0 = \frac{160}{3}$ seconds.

If $y_0 = 50$, the roots are $0$ and $-\frac{160}{3}$. This implies the tangency occurred before $\tau = 0$.

We need to determine the value of $y_0$. The problem statement says "At the instant when the building first blocks the line of sight between Jenny and Kenny, they are 200 feet apart." This instant is $\tau = 0$.

If the blockage starts at $\tau = 0$, it means the line connecting Jenny and Kenny at $\tau = 0$ is tangent to the building.
The line segment connects $(-100, y_0)$ and $(100, y_0)$. This horizontal segment is tangent to the circle when $|y_0| = 50$.

Let's consider the movement of the line segment.
At $\tau = 0$, the segment is horizontal at $y = y_0$.
As $\tau$ increases, the endpoints move upwards, with Kenny moving faster. The line segment rotates and shifts.

If $y_0 = 50$, at $\tau = 0$, the segment is from $(-100, 50)$ to $(100, 50)$, tangent from above.
If $y_0 = -50$, at $\tau = 0$, the segment is from $(-100, -50)$ to $(100, -50)$, tangent from below.

Consider the case $y_0 = -50$. At $\tau = 0$, the line of sight is tangent. As $\tau$ increases, Jenny moves to $(-100, -50 + \tau)$ and Kenny to $(100, -50 + 3\tau)$.
The line connecting them has equation $y = \frac{\tau}{100} x - 50 + 2\tau$.
The blockage ends when the line is tangent again. This occurs at $\tau = \frac{160}{3}$.
The duration of the blockage is $\frac{160}{3}$ seconds.

If $y_0 = 50$. At $\tau = 0$, the line of sight is tangent.
As $\tau$ increases, Jenny moves to $(-100, 50 + \tau)$ and Kenny to $(100, 50 + 3\tau)$.
The line connecting them has equation $y = \frac{\tau}{100} x + 50 + 2\tau$.
The other time of tangency is $\tau = -\frac{160}{3}$. This means before $\tau = 0$, the line was tangent.
The blockage started before $\tau = 0$. This contradicts the problem statement.

Therefore, we must have $y_0 = -50$. The blockage occurs during $0 \le \tau \le \frac{160}{3}$.
The amount of time the building blocks the view is $t = \frac{160}{3}$ seconds.

The fraction is $\frac{160}{3}$, which is in lowest terms since 160 is not divisible by 3.
Numerator = 160, denominator = 3.
Sum of numerator and denominator = $160 + 3 = 163$.

Let's double check the calculations.

The relative velocity of Kenny with respect to Jenny is $(3-1) = 2$ ft/s in the y-direction.
The initial relative position at $\tau = 0$ is $(200, 0)$.

Consider the geometry. The line of sight is blocked when the line segment intersects the building. This happens when the distance from the center of the building to the line is less than or equal to the radius.

The line passing through Jenny and Kenny is $\tau x - 100y + 100(y_0 + 2\tau) = 0$.
Distance from origin to the line: $\frac{|100y_0 + 200\tau|}{\sqrt{\tau^2 + 10000}}$.
Blockage occurs when $\frac{|100y_0 + 200\tau|}{\sqrt{\tau^2 + 10000}} \le 50$.
$(100y_0 + 200\tau)^2 \le 2500 (\tau^2 + 10000)$
$4 (y_0 + 2\tau)^2 \le \tau^2 + 10000$
$4(y_0^2 + 4y_0\tau + 4\tau^2) \le \tau^2 + 10000$
$4y_0^2 + 16y_0\tau + 16\tau^2 \le \tau^2 + 10000$
$15\tau^2 + 16y_0\tau + 4y_0^2 - 10000 \le 0$.

This inequality holds during the time the line of sight is blocked.
The roots of the quadratic $15\tau^2 + 16y_0\tau + 4y_0^2 - 10000 = 0$ are the times when the line of sight is tangent to the building.

If $y_0 = -50$, the roots are $\tau = 0$ and $\tau = \frac{160}{3}$.
The parabola $f(\tau) = 15\tau^2 - 800\tau$ opens upwards. $f(\tau) \le 0$ between the roots.
So, the blockage occurs for $0 \le \tau \le \frac{160}{3}$.
The duration is $\frac{160}{3}$.

If $y_0 = 50$, the roots are $\tau = 0$ and $\tau = -\frac{160}{3}$.
The parabola $g(\tau) = 15\tau^2 + 800\tau$ opens upwards. $g(\tau) \le 0$ between the roots.
So, the blockage would occur for $-\frac{160}{3} \le \tau \le 0$.
However, the problem states that the building first blocks the view at $\tau = 0$.

Consider the scenario with $y_0 = 50$. At $\tau = -\frac{160}{3}$, the line of sight becomes tangent. As $\tau$ increases to 0, the line of sight is blocked, and at $\tau = 0$, it becomes tangent again. This contradicts the "first blocks" condition.

The phrasing "at the instant when the building first blocks the line of sight" implies that before this instant, the line of sight was not blocked.

Final check of the question: "Let $t\,$ be the amount of time, in seconds, before Jenny and Kenny can see each other again." This means the duration of the blockage.

The times of tangency are the solutions to $15\tau^2 + 16y_0\tau + 4y_0^2 - 10000 = 0$.
If $y_0 = -50$, roots are $0, \frac{160}{3}$. Blockage interval $[0, \frac{160}{3}]$. Duration $\frac{160}{3}$.
If $y_0 = 50$, roots are $-\frac{160}{3}, 0$. Blockage interval $[-\frac{160}{3}, 0]$. This contradicts the "first blocks" at $\tau = 0$.

Therefore, $y_0 = -50$ is the correct scenario.
The time interval during which they cannot see each other is $t = \frac{160}{3}$ seconds.
The fraction is $\frac{160}{3}$, lowest terms.
Sum of numerator and denominator = $160 + 3 = 163$.

<text>As $\tau$ increases, Jenny moves to $(-100, 50 + \tau)$ and Kenny to $(100, 50 + 3\tau)$.
The line connecting them has equation $y = \frac{\tau}{100} x + 50 + 2\tau$.
The other time of tangency is $\tau = -\frac{160}{3}$. This means before $\tau = 0$, the line was tangent.
The blockage started before $\tau = 0$. This contradicts the problem statement.

Therefore, we must have $y_0 = -50$. The blockage occurs during $0 \le \tau \le \frac{160}{3}$.
The amount of time the building blocks the view is $t = \frac{160}{3}$ seconds.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses logical reasoning to identify a contradiction in one case (y₀ = 50) and concludes that the other case (y₀ = -50) must be correct. They apply the problem constraints to eliminate an invalid solution.</explanation>

<text>Consider the scenario with $y_0 = 50$. At $\tau = -\frac{160}{3}$, the line of sight becomes tangent. As $\tau$ increases to 0, the line of sight is blocked, and at $\tau = 0$, it becomes tangent again. This contradicts the "first blocks" condition.

The phrasing "at the instant when the building first blocks the line of sight" implies that before this instant, the line of sight was not blocked.

Final check of the question: "Let $t\,$ be the amount of time, in seconds, before Jenny and Kenny can see each other again." This means the duration of the blockage.</text>
<explanation>The solver carefully reasons about the wording of the problem to confirm their interpretation. They identify that the y₀ = 50 case contradicts the condition that the building "first blocks" the line of sight at τ = 0.</explanation>

<skill>Verification and Validation</skill>
<definition>The process of checking the correctness of a solution by testing it against the original problem conditions, alternative approaches, or special cases.</definition>

<text>The fraction is $\frac{160}{3}$, which is in lowest terms since 160 is not divisible by 3.
Numerator = 160, denominator = 3.
Sum of numerator and denominator = $160 + 3 = 163$.

Let's double check the calculations.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies their answer by checking that the fraction is in lowest terms and computing the requested sum. They also indicate they will double-check their calculations, showing a commitment to verification.</explanation>

<text>The relative velocity of Kenny with respect to Jenny is $(3-1) = 2$ ft/s in the y-direction.
The initial relative position at $\tau = 0$ is $(200, 0)$.

Consider the geometry. The line of sight is blocked when the line segment intersects the building. This happens when the distance from the center of the building to the line is less than or equal to the radius.

The line passing through Jenny and Kenny is $\tau x - 100y + 100(y_0 + 2\tau) = 0$.
Distance from origin to the line: $\frac{|100y_0 + 200\tau|}{\sqrt{\tau^2 + 10000}}$.
Blockage occurs when $\frac{|100y_0 + 200\tau|}{\sqrt{\tau^2 + 10000}} \le 50$.
$(100y_0 + 200\tau)^2 \le 2500 (\tau^2 + 10000)$
$4 (y_0 + 2\tau)^2 \le \tau^2 + 10000$
$4(y_0^2 + 4y_0\tau + 4\tau^2) \le \tau^2 + 10000$
$4y_0^2 + 16y_0\tau + 16\tau^2 \le \tau^2 + 10000$
$15\tau^2 + 16y_0\tau + 4y_0^2 - 10000 \le 0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver rechecks their work by considering the problem from a different angle - using the distance from the center of the building to the line of sight. This alternative
