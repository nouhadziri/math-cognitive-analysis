Problem:
ii. Estimate the time $t_{2}$ needed for the radius to shrink from $r_{0}$ to $r_{2}=0.95 r_{0}$. Neglect the change of the gravity field at the position of a falling gas particle.

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
During the period considered the pressure is negligible. Therefore the gas is in free fall. By Gauss' theorem and symmetry, the gravitational field at any point in the ball is equivalent to the one generated when all the mass closer to the center is compressed into the center. Moreover, while the ball has not yet shrunk much, the field strength on its surface does not change much either. The acceleration of the outermost layer stays approximately constant. Thus,

$$
t \approx \sqrt{\frac{2\left(r_{0}-r_{2}\right)}{g}}
$$

where

$$
\begin{aligned}
g & \approx \frac{G m}{r_{0}^{2}} \\
\therefore t & \approx \sqrt{\frac{2 r_{0}^{2}\left(r_{0}-r_{2}\right)}{G m}}=\sqrt{\frac{0.1 r_{0}^{3}}{G m}} .
\end{aligned}
$$

<skill>Physical Intuition</skill>
<definition>The ability to understand and apply physical principles to a problem, including recognizing which physical laws are relevant and how they constrain the solution.</definition>

<text>During the period considered the pressure is negligible. Therefore the gas is in free fall. By Gauss' theorem and symmetry, the gravitational field at any point in the ball is equivalent to the one generated when all the mass closer to the center is compressed into the center.</text>
<explanation>This span demonstrates physical intuition because the solver immediately identifies the relevant physical conditions (negligible pressure leading to free fall) and applies Gauss' theorem from electromagnetism to the gravitational context. This shows deep understanding of how physical laws can be transferred between domains and how symmetry simplifies the problem.</explanation>

<end>288</end>
<text>Moreover, while the ball has not yet shrunk much, the field strength on its surface does not change much either. The acceleration of the outermost layer stays approximately constant.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates physical intuition by recognizing that small changes in radius (5% reduction) would result in minimal changes to the gravitational field, allowing for the approximation that acceleration remains constant. This shows an understanding of how physical quantities scale and when approximations are valid.</explanation>

<skill>Approximation</skill>
<definition>The ability to simplify complex problems by making reasonable assumptions that reduce computational complexity while preserving the essential features of the problem.</definition>

<end>288</end>
<text>Moreover, while the ball has not yet shrunk much, the field strength on its surface does not change much either. The acceleration of the outermost layer stays approximately constant.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies approximation by recognizing that since r₂ = 0.95r₀ (only a 5% reduction), the gravitational field strength won't change significantly. This approximation simplifies the problem from a differential equation to a constant acceleration problem.</explanation>

<start>290</start>
<end>347</end>
<text>t \approx \sqrt{\frac{2\left(r_{0}-r_{2}\right)}{g}}</text>
<explanation>This equation demonstrates approximation as the solver uses the standard formula for distance under constant acceleration, treating the problem as a simple kinematics problem rather than solving a more complex differential equation that would account for continuously varying acceleration.</explanation>

<skill>Equation Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to transform mathematical expressions into equivalent forms that reveal insights or simplify calculations.</definition>

<start>349</start>
<end>478</end>
<text>g \approx \frac{G m}{r_{0}^{2}} \\
\therefore t \approx \sqrt{\frac{2 r_{0}^{2}\left(r_{0}-r_{2}\right)}{G m}}=\sqrt{\frac{0.1 r_{0}^{3}}{G m}}</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates equation manipulation by substituting the expression for g into the time formula, then simplifying the expression. They also substitute r₀-r₂ = 0.05r₀ and simplify 2×0.05 to 0.1 to obtain the final expression. This shows algebraic fluency and the ability to transform equations to reveal insights.</explanation>

<skill>Dimensional Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to check the consistency of equations by analyzing the units or dimensions of physical quantities, ensuring that equations are physically meaningful.</definition>

<start>349</start>
<end>478</end>
<text>g \approx \frac{G m}{r_{0}^{2}} \\
\therefore t \approx \sqrt{\frac{2 r_{0}^{2}\left(r_{0}-r_{2}\right)}{G m}}=\sqrt{\frac{0.1 r_{0}^{3}}{G m}}</text>
<explanation>The solver implicitly uses dimensional analysis by ensuring that the final equation for time has the correct dimensions. The gravitational constant G has units of m³/(kg·s²), mass m has units of kg, and r₀ has units of m. The resulting expression under the square root has units of s², ensuring that t has units of seconds, which is dimensionally correct for time.</explanation>

<skill>Conceptual Mapping</skill>
<definition>The ability to map a complex problem onto a simpler, familiar problem structure by recognizing analogies or correspondences between the problems.</definition>

<text>During the period considered the pressure is negligible. Therefore the gas is in free fall. By Gauss' theorem and symmetry, the gravitational field at any point in the ball is equivalent to the one generated when all the mass closer to the center is compressed into the center.</text>
<explanation>The solver maps the complex problem of a collapsing gas sphere to a simpler problem of a point mass falling in a gravitational field. This conceptual mapping allows them to use familiar kinematic equations rather than solving fluid dynamics equations.</explanation>

<start>290</start>
<end>347</end>
<text>t \approx \sqrt{\frac{2\left(r_{0}-r_{2}\right)}{g}}</text>
<explanation>Here, the solver maps the problem to the familiar kinematic equation for time under constant acceleration (t = √(2d/a)), showing the ability to recognize that this complex astrophysical scenario can be treated as a basic mechanics problem under appropriate approximations.</explanation>
