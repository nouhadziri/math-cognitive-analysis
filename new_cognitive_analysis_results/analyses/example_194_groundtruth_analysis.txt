Problem:
How many different positive values of $x$ will make this statement true: there are exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$.

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
If there are exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$, those two multiples must be $x$ and $2x$.  Therefore, $2x$ must be less than $100$, while $3x$ the next largest multiple of $x$, must be at least $100$ (or else there would be $3$, not $2$ multiples in the two-digit range).

It may take some trial and error to find the smallest and largest possible values of $x$ under these conditions.  The smallest is $x=34$, because $3x=102$, the smallest three-digit multiple of $3$.  If we tried anything smaller than $34$, $x$, $2x$, and $3x$ would all have two digits, and that doesn't satisfy the condition.

The largest possible value of $x$ is $49$, because if $x$ were $50$, $2x$ would equal $100$, and only one multiple of $x$ would have two digits.  Every value of $x$ from $34$ to $49$ works.

Now, we must count the number of integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive.  This is a surprisingly tricky process: you might think there should be $49-34$, or $15$ possible values of $x$, but that's not actually right!  Suppose we subtract $33$ from each number.  Then we are counting the numbers from $1$ to $16,$ and so there are $\boxed{16}$ integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive.

# Analysis of Cognitive Skills in Mathematical Problem-Solving

<skill>Problem Interpretation</skill>
<definition>The ability to understand and correctly interpret the problem statement, identifying what is being asked and what constraints are given.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>135</end>
<text>If there are exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$, those two multiples must be $x$ and $2x$.  Therefore, $2x$ must be less than $100$, while $3x$ the next largest multiple of $x$, must be at least $100$</text>
<explanation>The solver begins by interpreting what it means for a number to have exactly 2 positive two-digit multiples. They correctly identify that this means the multiples must be $x$ and $2x$, and establish the constraints that $2x < 100$ and $3x ≥ 100$. This demonstrates the ability to translate the problem statement into specific mathematical conditions.</explanation>

<skill>Constraint Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify, formulate, and work with mathematical constraints to determine the range of possible solutions.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>183</end>
<text>If there are exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$, those two multiples must be $x$ and $2x$.  Therefore, $2x$ must be less than $100$, while $3x$ the next largest multiple of $x$, must be at least $100$ (or else there would be $3$, not $2$ multiples in the two-digit range).</text>
<explanation>The solver formulates precise constraints that must be satisfied: $2x < 100$ and $3x ≥ 100$. They also explain the reasoning behind these constraints, showing understanding of how these conditions ensure exactly 2 two-digit multiples.</explanation>

<skill>Boundary Case Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and analyze the extreme or boundary cases that define the limits of a solution space.</definition>
<start>185</start>
<end>505</end>
<text>It may take some trial and error to find the smallest and largest possible values of $x$ under these conditions.  The smallest is $x=34$, because $3x=102$, the smallest three-digit multiple of $3$.  If we tried anything smaller than $34$, $x$, $2x$, and $3x$ would all have two digits, and that doesn't satisfy the condition.

The largest possible value of $x$ is $49$, because if $x$ were $50$, $2x$ would equal $100$, and only one multiple of $x$ would have two digits.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies and analyzes the boundary cases of the solution range. They determine that x=34 is the smallest valid value (because at x=33, 3x=99 would still be two digits) and x=49 is the largest valid value (because at x=50, 2x=100 would be three digits). This demonstrates careful analysis of where the constraints change behavior.</explanation>

<skill>Systematic Verification</skill>
<definition>The ability to systematically check and verify that potential solutions satisfy all the given conditions.</definition>
<start>185</start>
<end>506</end>
<text>It may take some trial and error to find the smallest and largest possible values of $x$ under these conditions.  The smallest is $x=34$, because $3x=102$, the smallest three-digit multiple of $3$.  If we tried anything smaller than $34$, $x$, $2x$, and $3x$ would all have two digits, and that doesn't satisfy the condition.

The largest possible value of $x$ is $49$, because if $x$ were $50$, $2x$ would equal $100$, and only one multiple of $x$ would have two digits.</text>
<explanation>The solver systematically verifies their boundary values by checking what happens just outside the boundaries. They verify that x=34 works by confirming 3x=102 (three digits), and that x=33 would not work because 3x=99 (still two digits). Similarly, they verify that x=49 works but x=50 would not because 2x would be 100.</explanation>

<skill>Generalization</skill>
<definition>The ability to extend findings from specific cases to a general principle or formula that applies to a broader range of cases.</definition>
<start>506</start>
<end>567</end>
<text>Every value of $x$ from $34$ to $49$ works.</text>
<explanation>After identifying the boundary cases, the solver generalizes that all values between these boundaries (from 34 to 49 inclusive) will satisfy the given conditions. This demonstrates the ability to extend from specific cases to a general range of solutions.</explanation>

<skill>Counting Strategy</skill>
<definition>The ability to correctly count elements in a set, particularly understanding how to count inclusive ranges.</definition>
<start>569</start>
<end>830</end>
<text>Now, we must count the number of integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive.  This is a surprisingly tricky process: you might think there should be $49-34$, or $15$ possible values of $x$, but that's not actually right!  Suppose we subtract $33$ from each number.  Then we are counting the numbers from $1$ to $16,$ and so there are $\boxed{16}$ integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates a sophisticated counting strategy by recognizing the potential error in simply subtracting the endpoints (49-34=15) and instead using a transformation approach (subtracting 33 from both endpoints) to correctly count the integers in an inclusive range. This shows awareness of the "fencepost error" that often occurs in counting problems.</explanation>

<skill>Metacognitive Awareness</skill>
<definition>The ability to reflect on one's own thinking process, recognize potential errors, and apply appropriate strategies to avoid them.</definition>
<start>569</start>
<end>736</end>
<text>Now, we must count the number of integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive.  This is a surprisingly tricky process: you might think there should be $49-34$, or $15$ possible values of $x$, but that's not actually right!</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates metacognitive awareness by explicitly acknowledging a common mistake in counting inclusive ranges (getting 15 instead of 16). They recognize this as a "tricky process" where intuition might lead to an incorrect answer, showing awareness of their own thinking process and potential pitfalls.</explanation>
