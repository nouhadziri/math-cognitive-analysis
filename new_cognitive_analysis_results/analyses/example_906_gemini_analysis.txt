Domain: Differential equations

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
The differential equation is given by $3(3+x^2)\frac{dx}{dt}=2(1+x^2)^2e^{-t^2}$.
We need to prove that if $x(0) \leq 1$, there exists $M>0$ such that $|x(t)| < M$ for all $t \geq 0$.
This means we need to show that the solution $x(t)$ is bounded for $t \geq 0$.

We can separate variables:
\[ \frac{3+x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} dx = \frac{2}{3} e^{-t^2} dt \]
Integrate both sides.
Let's analyze the left side. We can decompose the fraction:
\[ \frac{3+x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} = \frac{A}{1+x^2} + \frac{B}{(1+x^2)^2} \]
\[ 3+x^2 = A(1+x^2) + B = A + Ax^2 + B \]
Comparing coefficients, $A=1$ and $A+B=3$, so $B=2$.
\[ \frac{3+x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} = \frac{1}{1+x^2} + \frac{2}{(1+x^2)^2} \]
Now integrate the left side with respect to $x$:
\[ \int \left( \frac{1}{1+x^2} + \frac{2}{(1+x^2)^2} \right) dx = \arctan(x) + 2 \int \frac{1}{(1+x^2)^2} dx \]
To integrate $\int \frac{1}{(1+x^2)^2} dx$, use the substitution $x = \tan(\theta)$, so $dx = \sec^2(\theta) d\theta$.
\[ \int \frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{(1+\tan^2(\theta))^2} d\theta = \int \frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{(\sec^2(\theta))^2} d\theta = \int \frac{1}{\sec^2(\theta)} d\theta = \int \cos^2(\theta) d\theta \]
\[ \int \frac{1+\cos(2\theta)}{2} d\theta = \frac{1}{2} \theta + \frac{1}{4} \sin(2\theta) + C = \frac{1}{2} \arctan(x) + \frac{1}{2} \sin(\arctan(x))\cos(\arctan(x)) + C \]
If $y = \arctan(x)$, then $\tan(y) = x$. Consider a right triangle with opposite $x$ and adjacent $1$, so hypotenuse is $\sqrt{1+x^2}$.
$\sin(\arctan(x)) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}$ and $\cos(\arctan(x)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}$.
So $\sin(\arctan(x))\cos(\arctan(x)) = \frac{x}{1+x^2}$.
Therefore, $\int \frac{1}{(1+x^2)^2} dx = \frac{1}{2} \arctan(x) + \frac{x}{2(1+x^2)} + C$.
The integral of the left side is:
\[ \arctan(x) + 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} \arctan(x) + \frac{x}{2(1+x^2)} \right) = \arctan(x) + \arctan(x) + \frac{x}{1+x^2} = 2\arctan(x) + \frac{x}{1+x^2} \]
Now integrate the right side with respect to $t$:
\[ \int \frac{2}{3} e^{-t^2} dt = \frac{2}{3} \int e^{-t^2} dt \]
This integral is related to the error function, and we cannot evaluate it in elementary terms.
Let's consider the bounds of the integral.
\[ \int_0^t \frac{3+x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} \frac{dx}{d\tau} d\tau = \int_0^t \frac{2}{3} e^{-\tau^2} d\tau \]
\[ 2\arctan(x(t)) + \frac{x(t)}{1+x(t)^2} - \left( 2\arctan(x(0)) + \frac{x(0)}{1+x(0)^2} \right) = \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-\tau^2} d\tau \]
Let $F(x) = 2\arctan(x) + \frac{x}{1+x^2}$.
$F(x(t)) - F(x(0)) = \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-\tau^2} d\tau$.
We know that $\int_0^\infty e^{-\tau^2} d\tau = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$.
So, $0 \leq \int_0^t e^{-\tau^2} d\tau < \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$.
Therefore, $F(x(t)) - F(x(0)) < \frac{2}{3} \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
$F(x(t)) < F(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
Let's analyze the function $F(x) = 2\arctan(x) + \frac{x}{1+x^2}$.
As $x \to \infty$, $\arctan(x) \to \frac{\pi}{2}$, and $\frac{x}{1+x^2} \to 0$. So $F(x) \to \pi$.
As $x \to -\infty$, $\arctan(x) \to -\frac{\pi}{2}$, and $\frac{x}{1+x^2} \to 0$. So $F(x) \to -\pi$.
$F'(x) = \frac{2}{1+x^2} + \frac{(1+x^2) - x(2x)}{(1+x^2)^2} = \frac{2(1+x^2) + 1 - x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} = \frac{2+2x^2+1-x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} = \frac{3+x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} > 0$.
So $F(x)$ is an increasing function.
Given $x(0) \leq 1$.
$F(x(t)) < F(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
Since $F(x)$ is increasing, if $F(x(t))$ is bounded above, it doesn't directly imply that $x(t)$ is bounded above.
However, since $F(x)$ goes to $\pi$ as $x \to \infty$ and to $-\pi$ as $x \to -\infty$, if $F(x(t))$ is bounded, then $x(t)$ must be bounded.
Let $F(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3} = C_1$. Then $F(x(t)) < C_1$.
If $C_1 \leq \pi$, then since $F(x) \to \pi$ as $x \to \infty$, we cannot directly conclude $x(t)$ is bounded.

Let's consider the case where $x(t)$ tends to infinity.
If $x(t) \to \infty$, then $F(x(t)) \to \pi$.
We have $F(x(t)) = F(x(0)) + \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-\tau^2} d\tau$.
Since $\int_0^t e^{-\tau^2} d\tau$ is an increasing function and bounded by $\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$, the right side is bounded.
So $F(x(t))$ is bounded.
Since $\lim_{x \to \infty} F(x) = \pi$ and $\lim_{x \to -\infty} F(x) = -\pi$, and $F(x)$ is continuous and increasing, the range of $F(x)$ is $(-\pi, \pi)$.
We have $F(x(t)) < F(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
Since $x(0) \leq 1$, $F(x(0)) = 2\arctan(x(0)) + \frac{x(0)}{1+x(0)^2}$.
Maximum value of $F(x(0))$ when $x(0)=1$: $F(1) = 2\arctan(1) + \frac{1}{1+1^2} = 2 \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{1}{2}$.
So $F(x(t)) < \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
This upper bound is a finite number. Since $F(x)$ is increasing and tends to $\pi$ as $x \to \infty$, if $F(x(t))$ is bounded above by some value less than $\pi$, then $x(t)$ must be bounded above.

Now consider the lower bound.
$F(x(t)) = F(x(0)) + \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-\tau^2} d\tau \geq F(x(0))$.
Since $x(0) \leq 1$, the minimum value of $F(x(0))$ occurs when $x(0)$ is very small or negative.
As $x(0) \to -\infty$, $F(x(0)) \to -\pi$.
However, given a specific initial condition $x(0)$, $F(x(0))$ is a fixed number.
Let $L = F(x(0))$. Then $F(x(t)) \geq L$.
Since $F(x)$ is increasing and tends to $-\pi$ as $x \to -\infty$, if $F(x(t))$ is bounded below by some value greater than $-\pi$, then $x(t)$ must be bounded below.

So, we have shown that $F(x(t))$ is bounded. Since $F(x)$ is a strictly increasing function with range $(-\pi, \pi)$, if $-\pi < a \leq F(x(t)) \leq b < \pi$, then there exist $M_1, M_2$ such that $-\infty < M_1 \leq x(t) \leq M_2 < \infty$.

Alternative approach: Consider the sign of $\frac{dx}{dt}$.
$\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{2(1+x^2)^2e^{-t^2}}{3(3+x^2)}$.
Since $e^{-t^2} > 0$, $(1+x^2)^2 > 0$, $3+x^2 > 0$, we have $\frac{dx}{dt} > 0$.
So $x(t)$ is an increasing function.
Since $x(t)$ is increasing and starts at $x(0)$, we have $x(t) \geq x(0)$.

We have $2\arctan(x(t)) + \frac{x(t)}{1+x(t)^2} = 2\arctan(x(0)) + \frac{x(0)}{1+x(0)^2} + \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-\tau^2} d\tau$.
As $t \to \infty$, $\int_0^t e^{-\tau^2} d\tau \to \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$.
So, $\lim_{t \to \infty} \left( 2\arctan(x(t)) + \frac{x(t)}{1+x(t)^2} \right) = 2\arctan(x(0)) + \frac{x(0)}{1+x(0)^2} + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
Let the limit be $L_\infty$.
We know that $\lim_{t \to \infty} \left( 2\arctan(x(t)) + \frac{x(t)}{1+x(t)^2} \right) = \lim_{y \to \lim_{t \to \infty} x(t)} \left( 2\arctan(y) + \frac{y}{1+y^2} \right)$.
If $\lim_{t \to \infty} x(t) = \infty$, then the limit is $\pi$.
So we have $\pi = 2\arctan(x(0)) + \frac{x(0)}{1+x(0)^2} + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
$\pi - \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3} = 2\arctan(x(0)) + \frac{x(0)}{1+x(0)^2}$.
Let $g(x) = 2\arctan(x) + \frac{x}{1+x^2}$.
We know that the range of $g(x)$ is $(-\pi, \pi)$.
Since $\pi - \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3} \approx 3.14 - 0.59 = 2.55$, which is less than $\pi$.
If the limit of $x(t)$ is $\infty$, then we must have $\pi = F(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
This is possible if the equation holds for some $x(0)$.

Consider the case where $x(t)$ is unbounded. Since $x(t)$ is increasing, if it is unbounded, then $\lim_{t \to \infty} x(t) = \infty$.
Then $\lim_{t \to \infty} F(x(t)) = \pi$.
We have $F(x(t)) = F(x(0)) + \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-\tau^2} d\tau$.
As $t \to \infty$, $\lim_{t \to \infty} F(x(t)) = F(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
So, if $x(t)$ is unbounded, we must have $\pi = F(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
$\pi - \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3} = F(x(0))$.
Since $x(0) \leq 1$, the maximum value of $F(x(0))$ is $F(1) = \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \approx 1.57 + 0.5 = 2.07$.
$\pi - \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3} \approx 2.55$.
Since $2.55 > 2.07$, the equation $\pi - \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3} = F(x(0))$ cannot hold if $x(0) \leq 1$.
Therefore, the assumption that $x(t)$ is unbounded is false.
So $x(t)$ must be bounded above.

Since $\frac{dx}{dt} > 0$, $x(t)$ is increasing.
We are given $x(0) \leq 1$.
Since $x(t)$ is increasing, $x(t) \geq x(0)$.
We need to show that $x(t)$ is bounded above.

Let's use comparison.
$\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{2(1+x^2)^2}{3(3+x^2)} e^{-t^2} \leq \frac{2(1+x^2)^2}{9} e^{-t^2}$.
Consider the equation $\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{2}{9} (1+y^2)^2 e^{-t^2}$, with $y(0) = x(0)$.
If we can show that $y(t)$ is bounded, it doesn't directly imply $x(t)$ is bounded, because the inequality is in the derivative.

Consider $G(x) = 2\arctan(x) + \frac{x}{1+x^2}$.
We have $G(x(t)) = G(x(0)) + \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-\tau^2} d\tau$.
Since $0 \leq \int_0^t e^{-\tau^2} d\tau < \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$,
$G(x(0)) \leq G(x(t)) < G(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
Let $M_{up} = G(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
Since $x(0) \leq 1$, $G(x(0)) \leq G(1) = \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{1}{2}$.
So $G(x(t)) < \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
Since $\lim_{x \to \infty} G(x) = \pi$, and $G(x)$ is increasing, if $G(x(t))$ is bounded above by a value less than $\pi$, then $x(t)$ must be bounded above.
$\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3} \approx 1.57 + 0.5 + 0.59 = 2.66 < \pi \approx 3.14$.
So $x(t)$ is bounded above.

Let $M_{low} = G(x(0))$.
Since $x(0) \leq 1$, we don't have a fixed lower bound for $G(x(0))$.
However, we know that $\lim_{x \to -\infty} G(x) = -\pi$.
We have $G(x(t)) \geq G(x(0))$.
Since $G(x)$ is increasing, if $G(x(t))$ is bounded below, then $x(t)$ is bounded below.
Since $x(t)$ is increasing and starts at $x(0)$, we have $x(t) \geq x(0)$.

We have shown that $x(t)$ is increasing and bounded above. Therefore, $\lim_{t \to \infty} x(t)$ exists and is finite.
Let $\lim_{t \to \infty} x(t) = L$.
Then $\lim_{t \to \infty} G(x(t)) = G(L)$.
Also, $\lim_{t \to \infty} G(x(t)) = G(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
So $G(L) = G(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
Since $G$ is strictly increasing, $L$ is uniquely determined.

We need to show that $|x(t)| < M$ for some $M>0$.
Since $x(t)$ is increasing, $x(t) \geq x(0)$.
If $x(0) \geq 0$, then $x(t) \geq 0$, so $|x(t)| = x(t)$. Since $x(t)$ is bounded above, $|x(t)|$ is bounded.
If $x(0) < 0$, then $x(t)$ is increasing.
We have $G(x(t)) \geq G(x(0))$.
Since $\lim_{x \to -\infty} G(x) = -\pi$, if $G(x(t))$ is bounded below, $x(t)$ is bounded below.

<start>Now integrate the left side with respect to $x$:</start>
<end>The integral of the left side is:
\[ \arctan(x) + 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} \arctan(x) + \frac{x}{2(1+x^2)} \right) = \arctan(x) + \arctan(x) + \frac{x}{1+x^2} = 2\arctan(x) + \frac{x}{1+x^2} \]</end>
<text>Now integrate the left side with respect to $x$:
\[ \int \left( \frac{1}{1+x^2} + \frac{2}{(1+x^2)^2} \right) dx = \arctan(x) + 2 \int \frac{1}{(1+x^2)^2} dx \]
To integrate $\int \frac{1}{(1+x^2)^2} dx$, use the substitution $x = \tan(\theta)$, so $dx = \sec^2(\theta) d\theta$.
\[ \int \frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{(1+\tan^2(\theta))^2} d\theta = \int \frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{(\sec^2(\theta))^2} d\theta = \int \frac{1}{\sec^2(\theta)} d\theta = \int \cos^2(\theta) d\theta \]
\[ \int \frac{1+\cos(2\theta)}{2} d\theta = \frac{1}{2} \theta + \frac{1}{4} \sin(2\theta) + C = \frac{1}{2} \arctan(x) + \frac{1}{2} \sin(\arctan(x))\cos(\arctan(x)) + C \]
If $y = \arctan(x)$, then $\tan(y) = x$. Consider a right triangle with opposite $x$ and adjacent $1$, so hypotenuse is $\sqrt{1+x^2}$.
$\sin(\arctan(x)) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}$ and $\cos(\arctan(x)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}$.
So $\sin(\arctan(x))\cos(\arctan(x)) = \frac{x}{1+x^2}$.
Therefore, $\int \frac{1}{(1+x^2)^2} dx = \frac{1}{2} \arctan(x) + \frac{x}{2(1+x^2)} + C$.
The integral of the left side is:
\[ \arctan(x) + 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} \arctan(x) + \frac{x}{2(1+x^2)} \right) = \arctan(x) + \arctan(x) + \frac{x}{1+x^2} = 2\arctan(x) + \frac{x}{1+x^2} \]</text>

<start>Let's analyze the function $F(x) = 2\arctan(x) + \frac{x}{1+x^2}$.</start>
<end>So $F(x)$ is an increasing function.</end>
<text>Let's analyze the function $F(x) = 2\arctan(x) + \frac{x}{1+x^2}$.
As $x \to \infty$, $\arctan(x) \to \frac{\pi}{2}$, and $\frac{x}{1+x^2} \to 0$. So $F(x) \to \pi$.
As $x \to -\infty$, $\arctan(x) \to -\frac{\pi}{2}$, and $\frac{x}{1+x^2} \to 0$. So $F(x) \to -\pi$.
$F'(x) = \frac{2}{1+x^2} + \frac{(1+x^2) - x(2x)}{(1+x^2)^2} = \frac{2(1+x^2) + 1 - x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} = \frac{2+2x^2+1-x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} = \frac{3+x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} > 0$.
So $F(x)$ is an increasing function.</text>

<text>We know that $\int_0^\infty e^{-\tau^2} d\tau = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$.
So, $0 \leq \int_0^t e^{-\tau^2} d\tau < \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$.
Therefore, $F(x(t)) - F(x(0)) < \frac{2}{3} \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
$F(x(t)) < F(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.

[...several steps of analysis...]

Since $x(0) \leq 1$, $G(x(0)) \leq G(1) = \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{1}{2}$.
So $G(x(t)) < \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
Since $\lim_{x \to \infty} G(x) = \pi$, and $G(x)$ is increasing, if $G(x(t))$ is bounded above by a value less than $\pi$, then $x(t)$ must be bounded above.
$\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3} \approx 1.57 + 0.5 + 0.59 = 2.66 < \pi \approx 3.14$.
So $x(t)$ is bounded above.</text>
<explanation>The solver establishes bounds on integrals and functions to demonstrate that the solution must be bounded.

<text>Consider the case where $x(t)$ is unbounded. Since $x(t)$ is increasing, if it is unbounded, then $\lim_{t \to \infty} x(t) = \infty$.
Then $\lim_{t \to \infty} F(x(t)) = \pi$.
We have $F(x(t)) = F(x(0)) + \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-\tau^2} d\tau$.
As $t \to \infty$, $\lim_{t \to \infty} F(x(t)) = F(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
So, if $x(t)$ is unbounded, we must have $\pi = F(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
$\pi - \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3} = F(x(0))$.
Since $x(0) \leq 1$, the maximum value of $F(x(0))$ is $F(1) = \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \approx 1.57 + 0.5 = 2.07$.
$\pi - \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3} \approx 2.55$.
Since $2.55 > 2.07$, the equation $\pi - \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3} = F(x(0))$ cannot hold if $x(0) \leq 1$.
Therefore, the assumption that $x(t)$ is unbounded is false.
So $x(t)$ must be bounded above.</text>
<explanation>The solver employs proof by contradiction by assuming that x(t) is unbounded, then derives a mathematical condition that must be satisfied under this assumption.

<text>As $t \to \infty$, $\int_0^t e^{-\tau^2} d\tau \to \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$.
So, $\lim_{t \to \infty} \left( 2\arctan(x(t)) + \frac{x(t)}{1+x(t)^2} \right) = 2\arctan(x(0)) + \frac{x(0)}{1+x(0)^2} + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
Let the limit be $L_\infty$.
We know that $\lim_{t \to \infty} \left( 2\arctan(x(t)) + \frac{x(t)}{1+x(t)^2} \right) = \lim_{y \to \lim_{t \to \infty} x(t)} \left( 2\arctan(y) + \frac{y}{1+y^2} \right)$.

[...additional limit analysis...]

We have shown that $x(t)$ is increasing and bounded above. Therefore, $\lim_{t \to \infty} x(t)$ exists and is finite.
Let $\lim_{t \to \infty} x(t) = L$.
Then $\lim_{t \to \infty} G(x(t)) = G(L)$.
Also, $\lim_{t \to \infty} G(x(t)) = G(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
So $G(L) = G(x(0)) + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}$.
Since $G$ is strictly increasing, $L$ is uniquely determined.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes the limiting behavior of functions as t approaches infinity, including the definite integral of e^(-τ²) and the composite function G(x(t)). They use limit properties to establish the existence and uniqueness of the limit of x(t), which helps prove that the solution is bounded.</explanation>

<definition>The examination of whether a function is increasing or decreasing over a given domain, often using derivatives to establish this property.</definition>
<start>Alternative approach: Consider the sign of $\frac{dx}{dt}$.</start>
<end>So $x(t)$ is an increasing function.</end>
<text>Alternative approach: Consider the sign of $\frac{dx}{dt}$.
$\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{2(1+x^2)^2e^{-t^2}}{3(3+x^2)}$.
Since $e^{-t^2} > 0$, $(1+x^2)^2 > 0$, $3+x^2 > 0$, we have $\frac{dx}{dt} > 0$.
So $x(t)$ is an increasing function.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes the sign of the derivative dx/dt to establish that x(t) is strictly increasing. By examining each factor in the expression and determining that they are all positive, they conclude that the derivative is always positive, which is a key insight for understanding the behavior of the solution.</explanation>

<skill>Numerical Estimation</skill>
<definition>The ability to perform approximate calculations to determine if mathematical expressions satisfy certain inequalities or constraints.</definition>
<start>$\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3} \approx 1.57 + 0.5 + 0.59 = 2.66 < \pi \approx 3.14$.</start>
<end>$\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3} \approx 1.57
