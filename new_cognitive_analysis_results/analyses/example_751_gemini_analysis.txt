We shall consider the left $A$-modules (that is, $\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces $V$ with $\mathbb{C}$-algebra homomorphisms $\rho: A \rightarrow \operatorname{End}(V))$. (2) Determine all simple modules of $A$.

Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let $A$ be the algebra of $n \times n$ upper triangular complex matrices.
We want to determine all simple left $A$-modules.
A simple module is a non-zero module $V$ such that its only submodules are $\{0\}$ and $V$.

Let $V$ be a simple $A$-module. For any non-zero $v \in V$, the submodule $Av = \{av \mid a \in A\}$ must be equal to $V$.
Consider the standard basis vectors $e_1, \dots, e_n$ of $\mathbb{C}^n$.
Let $E_{ij}$ be the matrix with 1 at the $(i, j)$-entry and 0 elsewhere.
The set of upper triangular matrices has a basis $\{E_{ij} \mid 1 \leq i \leq j \leq n\}$.

Consider the case $n=2$. The algebra $A$ consists of matrices $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix}$, where $a, b, d \in \mathbb{C}$.
Let $V$ be a simple $A$-module. Let $v \in V$ be a non-zero vector. Then $Av = V$.
Consider the module $\mathbb{C}^1$. We can define a module structure on $\mathbb{C}$ by the homomorphism $\rho: A \rightarrow \operatorname{End}(\mathbb{C}) \cong \mathbb{C}$.
We can define $\rho\left(\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix}\right) = a$.
Then for any $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix} \in A$ and $c \in \mathbb{C}$, the action is $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix} \cdot c = a c$.
The submodules are ideals of $\mathbb{C}$, which are $\{0\}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. So this is a simple module.
We can also define $\rho\left(\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix}\right) = d$.
Then for any $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix} \in A$ and $c \in \mathbb{C}$, the action is $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix} \cdot c = d c$.
This is also a simple module.

Consider the case $n=n$.
Let $V$ be a simple $A$-module.
Let $I_k$ be the set of matrices in $A$ with the $k$-th diagonal entry equal to 0. This is a left ideal of $A$.
If for all $a \in I_k$, $a \cdot v = 0$, then the action of a matrix on $v$ depends only on the $k$-th diagonal entry.
Let $M \in A$. Then $M v = \lambda_k v$, where $\lambda_k$ is the $k$-th diagonal entry of $M$.
Consider the vector space $\mathbb{C}$. We can define an $A$-module structure on $\mathbb{C}$ by the map $\rho_k: A \rightarrow \operatorname{End}(\mathbb{C}) \cong \mathbb{C}$, where $\rho_k(M)$ is the $k$-th diagonal entry of $M$.
Let $M = (m_{ij})$. Then $\rho_k(M) = m_{kk}$.
The module action is $M \cdot c = m_{kk} c$ for $c \in \mathbb{C}$.
The submodules are $\{0\}$ and $\mathbb{C}$, so this is a simple module.

Let $V$ be a simple $A$-module. Let $0 \neq v \in V$. Then $Av = V$.
Consider the action of the diagonal matrices $E_{ii}$.
Let $v \in V$. Then $E_{ii} v \in V$.
Suppose for all $1 \leq i \leq n$, $E_{ii} v = \lambda_i v$ for some $\lambda_i \in \mathbb{C}$.
Let $M = (m_{ij}) \in A$. Then $M v = \sum_{i \leq j} m_{ij} E_{ij} v$.
Consider the case when $V = \mathbb{C}$ and the action is through the $k$-th diagonal entry.
Let $W \subseteq V$ be a submodule. If $W \neq \{0\}$, there exists $0 \neq w \in W$. Then $Aw = V$.

Let $V$ be a simple $A$-module.
Consider the action of the ideal $N$ of strictly upper triangular matrices.
$N = \{M \in A \mid m_{ii} = 0 \text{ for all } i\}$.
$N$ is a two-sided ideal of $A$.
Consider the submodule $NV = \{ \sum_{i=1}^k a_i v_i \mid a_i \in N, v_i \in V \}$.
Since $V$ is simple, either $NV = \{0\}$ or $NV = V$.
If $NV = V$, then $V = NV = N(NV) = N^2 V = \dots$. Since $N^n = 0$, we have $V = N^n V = \{0\}$, which is a contradiction.
Therefore, $NV = \{0\}$. This means that for any strictly upper triangular matrix $M \in N$ and any $v \in V$, $Mv = 0$.

So the action of $A$ on $V$ factors through $A/N$.
$A/N \cong \mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{C} \times \dots \times \mathbb{C}$ ($n$ times).
The isomorphism is given by $M \mapsto (m_{11}, m_{22}, \dots, m_{nn})$.
So $V$ is a simple module over $A/N$.
The simple modules over a direct product of algebras are the tensor products of simple modules over each algebra.
The simple modules over $\mathbb{C}$ are $\mathbb{C}$ itself.
So the simple modules over $A/N$ are of the form $S_1 \otimes S_2 \otimes \dots \otimes S_n$, where $S_i$ is a simple module over $\mathbb{C}$.
Since $\mathbb{C}$ is a field, the simple modules are 1-dimensional vector spaces.
So the simple modules over $A/N$ are 1-dimensional vector spaces where the action of $A/N$ is given by the projection onto one of the factors.

Let $V$ be a simple $A$-module. Since $NV=0$, for any $M \in A$ and $v \in V$, the action of $M$ on $v$ depends only on the diagonal entries of $M$.
Let $v \in V$ be a non-zero vector. Then $Av = V$.
For any $M \in A$, $Mv = \text{diag}(M) v$, where $\text{diag}(M)$ is a diagonal matrix with the same diagonal entries as $M$.
Let $E_{ii}$ be the matrix with 1 at the $(i,i)$-entry and 0 elsewhere.
For any $v \in V$, $E_{ii} v = \lambda_i v$ for some $\lambda_i \in \mathbb{C}$.
Let $M = (m_{ij}) \in A$. Then $Mv = \sum_{i \leq j} m_{ij} E_{ij} v = \sum_{i=1}^n m_{ii} E_{ii} v = \sum_{i=1}^n m_{ii} \lambda_i v$.
This suggests that the dimension of $V$ is 1.

Let $V$ be a 1-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{C}$.
Let $v$ be a basis for $V$.
The action of $A$ on $V$ is given by $\rho: A \rightarrow \operatorname{End}(V) \cong \mathbb{C}$.
For $M \in A$, $\rho(M)$ must be a scalar.
Since $NV = 0$, $\rho(M) = 0$ for all $M \in N$.
This means $\rho(M)$ depends only on the diagonal entries of $M$.
Consider the map $\rho_k: A \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ given by $\rho_k(M) = m_{kk}$.
This is an algebra homomorphism.
The corresponding module structure on $\mathbb{C}$ is $M \cdot c = m_{kk} c$.
Let $W \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ be a submodule. Then for any $w \in W$, $M \cdot w = m_{kk} w \in W$.
If $W \neq \{0\}$, let $0 \neq w \in W$. Then for any $c \in \mathbb{C}$, consider the matrix $M$ with $m_{kk} = c$. Then $M \cdot w = c w \in W$. So $W = \mathbb{C}$.
Thus, these are simple modules.

Are there any other simple modules?
Let $V$ be a simple $A$-module. We know $NV = 0$.
So the action of $A$ factors through $A/N \cong \mathbb{C}^n$.
As a module over $A/N$, $V$ is a simple module.
The simple modules over $\mathbb{C}^n$ are the simple modules over the individual factors.
Let $\pi_k: A \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be the projection onto the $k$-th diagonal entry.
This defines an $A$-module structure on $\mathbb{C}$ by $M \cdot c = \pi_k(M) c = m_{kk} c$.
Let $V$ be a simple $A$-module. Choose $0 \neq v \in V$. Then $Av = V$.
Since $NV = 0$, for any $M \in N$, $Mv = 0$.
Let $M, P \in A$. Then $(MP - PM) v = MPv - PMv$.
If $MP - PM \in N$, then $(MP - PM) v = 0$, so $MPv = PMv$.
Consider $E_{ij}$ for $i < j$ and $E_{kk}$.
$E_{kk} E_{ij} - E_{ij} E_{kk} = \delta_{kj} E_{ik} - \delta_{ki} E_{kj}$.
If $k \neq i$ and $k \neq j$, then $E_{kk} E_{ij} - E_{ij} E_{kk} = 0$. So $E_{kk} (E_{ij} v) = E_{ij} (E_{kk} v)$.
If $v$ is an eigenvector for all $E_{kk}$, $E_{kk} v = \lambda_k v$.
Then $E_{kk} (E_{ij} v) = \lambda_k (E_{ij} v)$ and $E_{ij} (E_{kk} v) = \lambda_k (E_{ij} v)$.

Consider the action of $A$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$ by matrix multiplication.
Let $W \subseteq \mathbb{C}^n$ be a submodule.
If $w = (0, \dots, 0, c, 0, \dots, 0)^T$ with $c \neq 0$ at the $k$-th position.
Then $E_{kk} w = w$.
$E_{ij} w = 0$ for $j \neq k$.
If $i < k$, $E_{ik} w = c e_i$.
So the submodules are not necessarily simple.
Example $n=2$: $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
The submodule spanned by $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is $\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} a \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \mid a \in \mathbb{C} \right\}$.

Let $V$ be a simple $A$-module.
We know that $NV = 0$.
Consider the maximal ideals of $A$.
The maximal ideals of $A$ are of the form $I_k = \{M \in A \mid m_{kk} = 0\}$.
$A/I_k \cong \mathbb{C}$.
So $A/I_k$ is a simple module over $A$.
The action of $A$ on $A/I_k$ is $M \cdot (P + I_k) = MP + I_k$.
$A/I_k$ as a vector space is 1-dimensional.
Let $k=1$. $I_1 = \{M \in A \mid m_{11} = 0\}$.
$A/I_1$ as a vector space can be identified with the span of $E_{11} + I_1$.
The action of $M \in A$ on $E_{11} + I_1$ is $ME_{11} + I_1$.
$ME_{11}$ is the matrix whose first column is the first column of $M$, and other columns are zero.
$ME_{11} = \begin{pmatrix} m_{11} & 0 & \dots \\ m_{21} & 0 & \dots \\ \vdots & \vdots & \end{pmatrix}$.
This is not necessarily in the span of $E_{11}$.

Let $V$ be a simple $A$-module.
Since $NV = 0$, $V$ is a module over $A/N \cong \mathbb{C}^n$.
The simple modules over $\mathbb{C}^n = \mathbb{C} \times \dots \times \mathbb{C}$ are 1-dimensional.
The action of $(c_1, \dots, c_n) \in \mathbb{C}^n$ on $v \in V$ is given by $(c_1, \dots, c_n) \cdot v = c_i v$ for some $i$.
This means that the action of $M \in A$ on $v \in V$ is $M \cdot v = m_{kk} v$ for some $k$.

Let $S_k$ be the 1-dimensional vector space $\mathbb{C}$ with the action of $A$ given by $M \cdot c = m_{kk} c$.
We need to show that these are all the simple $A$-modules.
Let $V$ be a simple $A$-module.
Since $NV = 0$, $V$ is an $A/N$-module.
$A/N$ is a semisimple algebra, so every module is a direct sum of simple modules.
Since $V$ is a simple $A/N$-module, it must be one of the simple modules of $A/N$.
The simple modules of $A/N \cong \mathbb{C}^n$ are the 1-dimensional modules where the action is through one of the projections.
Let $\chi_k: A/N \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be the projection onto the $k$-th component.
This corresponds to the map $\rho_k: A \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ given by $\rho_k(M) = m_{kk}$.
The simple modules correspond to the irreducible representations.

Consider the radical of $A$, which is $N$.
The simple modules of $A$ are the simple modules of $A/\operatorname{rad}(A) = A/N$.
The algebra $A/N$ is isomorphic to the direct product of $n$ copies of $\mathbb{C}$.
The simple modules of a direct product of algebras are the tensor products of simple modules over each factor.
The simple module of $\mathbb{C}$ is $\mathbb{C}$ itself.
So the simple modules of $A/N$ are $S_1 \otimes S_2 \otimes \dots \otimes S_n$, where $S_i$ is a simple module over the $i$-th copy of $\mathbb{C}$.
Since the modules are over $\mathbb{C}$, these are 1-dimensional vector spaces.
The action of $A/N$ on a simple module is through one of the projections.
Let $W$ be a simple $A/N$-module. Then $W$ is a 1-dimensional vector space, say $\mathbb{C}$.
The action of $(c_1, \dots, c_n) \in A/N$ on $w \in W$ is $(c_1, \dots, c_n) \cdot w = c_k w$ for some fixed $k$.
As an $A$-module, the action of $M \in A$ on $w \in W$ is $M \cdot w = m_{kk} w$.
This is the simple module $S_k$ defined earlier.

Double check the definition of simple module. A non-zero module such that its only submodules are $\{0\}$ and itself.

Let $V$ be a simple $A$-module. We showed $NV = 0$.
So $V$ can be viewed as a module over $A/N$.
Let $W \subseteq V$ be an $A/N$-submodule. This is also an $A$-submodule.
Since $V$ is a simple $A$-module, the only $A$-submodules are $\{0\}$ and $V$.
Thus, the only $A/N$-submodules are $\{0\}$ and $V$.
So $V$ is a simple $A/N$-module.
The simple modules of $A/N \cong \mathbb{C}^n$ are the 1-dimensional modules where the action is through one of the components.
These correspond to the simple $A$-modules $S_k$.
