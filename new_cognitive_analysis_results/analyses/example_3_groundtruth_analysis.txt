<text>167.0</text>
<explanation>The solver has provided the numerical answer of 167.0 m/s, which indicates they have applied domain knowledge from kinetic theory of gases. To arrive at this specific value, they would need to know and apply the formula for mean molecular speed (v = √(8RT/πM)), along with knowledge of the gas constant R, temperature T (likely assumed to be standard temperature), and the molar mass of radon. The precision of the answer suggests application of specific physics knowledge rather than estimation.</explanation>

<skill>Quantitative Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The ability to understand, interpret and manipulate numerical information to reach conclusions. This includes performing calculations, understanding units, and working with mathematical relationships.</definition>

<text>167.0</text>
<explanation>The solver has performed calculations to arrive at the precise value of 167.0 m/s. This would have required manipulating the formula for mean molecular speed, substituting values correctly, and performing operations like square roots. They also understood the requirement to express the answer in m/s as specified in the problem.</explanation>

<skill>Formula Selection</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and select the appropriate formula or equation needed to solve a specific problem from among many possible formulas in a domain.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>5</end>
<text>167.0</text>
<explanation>To arrive at this answer, the solver needed to select the correct formula for mean molecular speed in kinetic theory of gases. They would have had to distinguish this from other similar formulas like RMS speed or most probable speed, showing their ability to match the problem requirements to the appropriate mathematical relationship.</explanation>

<skill>Unit Awareness</skill>
<definition>The ability to track, convert, and work with appropriate units throughout problem-solving to ensure dimensional consistency and arrive at answers with correct units.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>5</end>
<text>167.0</text>
<explanation>The solver has provided an answer in m/s as required by the problem. This demonstrates awareness of the appropriate units for molecular speed and likely required converting or ensuring consistency of units throughout their calculation (e.g., ensuring gas constant R and molar mass M were in compatible units to yield m/s).</explanation>
