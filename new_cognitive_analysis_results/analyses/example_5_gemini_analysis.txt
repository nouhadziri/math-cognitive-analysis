Find the greatest integer that does not exceed $x^2/100$ .

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the value of $\lfloor x^2/100 \rfloor$, where $x$ is the length of a segment parallel to the bases that divides the trapezoid into two regions of equal area. We are given information about the lengths of the bases and the ratio of the areas created by the segment joining the midpoints of the legs.

Let the lengths of the two bases of the trapezoid be $b_1$ and $b_2$, with $b_1 > b_2$. We are given that $b_1 = b_2 + 100$.
Let the height of the trapezoid be $h$.

The segment that joins the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midline. Its length is the average of the lengths of the bases, $m = \frac{b_1 + b_2}{2}$.
The midline divides the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids of the same height $h/2$.

The lengths of the parallel sides of the upper trapezoid are $b_2$ and $m$. Its area is $A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \left( b_2 + m \right) \frac{h}{2} = \frac{h}{4} \left( b_2 + \frac{b_1 + b_2}{2} \right) = \frac{h}{4} \left( \frac{2b_2 + b_1 + b_2}{2} \right) = \frac{h}{8} (b_1 + 3b_2)$.
The lengths of the parallel sides of the lower trapezoid are $m$ and $b_1$. Its area is $A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( m + b_1 \right) \frac{h}{2} = \frac{h}{4} \left( \frac{b_1 + b_2}{2} + b_1 \right) = \frac{h}{4} \left( \frac{b_1 + b_2 + 2b_1}{2} \right) = \frac{h}{8} (3b_1 + b_2)$.

The ratio of the areas of these two regions is given as $2:3$ or $3:2$.

Case 1: $A_1 / A_2 = 2/3$
$\frac{\frac{h}{8} (b_1 + 3b_2)}{\frac{h}{8} (3b_1 + b_2)} = \frac{2}{3}$
$\frac{b_1 + 3b_2}{3b_1 + b_2} = \frac{2}{3}$
$3(b_1 + 3b_2) = 2(3b_1 + b_2)$
$3b_1 + 9b_2 = 6b_1 + 2b_2$
$7b_2 = 3b_1$

Substitute $b_1 = b_2 + 100$:
$7b_2 = 3(b_2 + 100)$
$7b_2 = 3b_2 + 300$
$4b_2 = 300$
$b_2 = 75$
$b_1 = 75 + 100 = 175$

Case 2: $A_1 / A_2 = 3/2$
$\frac{b_1 + 3b_2}{3b_1 + b_2} = \frac{3}{2}$
$2(b_1 + 3b_2) = 3(3b_1 + b_2)$
$2b_1 + 6b_2 = 9b_1 + 3b_2$
$3b_2 = 7b_1$

Substitute $b_1 = b_2 + 100$:
$3b_2 = 7(b_2 + 100)$
$3b_2 = 7b_2 + 700$
$-4b_2 = 700$
$b_2 = -175$, which is not possible since length must be positive.

So, we have $b_1 = 175$ and $b_2 = 75$.

Now, consider a segment parallel to the bases of length $y$ that divides the trapezoid into two regions. Let the distance from the base $b_2$ to this segment be $h_1$, and the distance from this segment to the base $b_1$ be $h_2$, such that $h_1 + h_2 = h$.
The upper region is a trapezoid with bases $b_2$ and $y$, and height $h_1$. Its area is $Area_{upper} = \frac{1}{2} (b_2 + y) h_1$.
The lower region is a trapezoid with bases $y$ and $b_1$, and height $h_2$. Its area is $Area_{lower} = \frac{1}{2} (y + b_1) h_2$.

We need to find the length $x$ of a segment parallel to the bases that divides the trapezoid into two regions of equal area. Let this segment be at a distance $h'$ from the base $b_2$. The length of this segment is $x$.
Using similar triangles, we have $\frac{y - b_2}{h_1} = \frac{b_1 - b_2}{h}$, so $y = b_2 + \frac{h_1}{h} (b_1 - b_2)$.

The area of the trapezoid is $A_{total} = \frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) h = \frac{1}{2} (175 + 75) h = \frac{1}{2} (250) h = 125h$.

The segment of length $x$ divides the trapezoid into two regions of equal area, so each region has area $\frac{1}{2} A_{total} = \frac{125h}{2}$.
The upper region has bases $b_2$ and $x$, and height $h'$. Its area is $\frac{1}{2} (b_2 + x) h'$.
We have $\frac{1}{2} (b_2 + x) h' = \frac{125h}{2}$, so $(b_2 + x) h' = 125h$.

We also have $x = b_2 + \frac{h'}{h} (b_1 - b_2)$.
$x - b_2 = \frac{h'}{h} (b_1 - b_2)$
$\frac{h'}{h} = \frac{x - b_2}{b_1 - b_2}$

Substitute this into the area equation:
$(b_2 + x) h \frac{x - b_2}{b_1 - b_2} = 125h$
$(b_2 + x)(x - b_2) = 125 (b_1 - b_2)$
$x^2 - b_2^2 = 125 (b_1 - b_2)$

Substitute the values of $b_1$ and $b_2$:
$b_1 - b_2 = 175 - 75 = 100$.
$x^2 - (75)^2 = 125 (100)$
$x^2 - 5625 = 12500$
$x^2 = 12500 + 5625 = 18125$

We need to find the greatest integer that does not exceed $x^2/100$.
$\frac{x^2}{100} = \frac{18125}{100} = 181.25$.
The greatest integer that does not exceed $181.25$ is $\lfloor 181.25 \rfloor = 181$.

Let's double-check the calculations.

The length of the segment joining the midpoints of the legs is $m = \frac{b_1 + b_2}{2} = \frac{175 + 75}{2} = \frac{250}{2} = 125$.

Area of the upper region formed by the midline:
$A_1 = \frac{h}{8} (b_1 + 3b_2) = \frac{h}{8} (175 + 3 \times 75) = \frac{h}{8} (175 + 225) = \frac{h}{8} (400) = 50h$.
Area of the lower region formed by the midline:
$A_2 = \frac{h}{8} (3b_1 + b_2) = \frac{h}{8} (3 \times 175 + 75) = \frac{h}{8} (525 + 75) = \frac{h}{8} (600) = 75h$.
The ratio $A_1 : A_2 = 50h : 75h = 50 : 75 = 2 : 3$, which matches the given information.

Now, let the segment parallel to the bases that divides the trapezoid into two equal areas have length $x$.
The area of the upper trapezoid with bases $b_2$ and $x$ is $\frac{1}{2} (b_2 + x) h'$.
The area of the lower trapezoid with bases $x$ and $b_1$ is $\frac{1}{2} (x + b_1) (h - h')$.

We used the formula for the length of a segment parallel to the bases at a height $h'$ from the base $b_2$:
$x = b_2 + \frac{h'}{h} (b_1 - b_2)$.

The area of the trapezoid with height $h'$ and bases $b_2, x$ is $\frac{1}{2} (b_2 + x) h'$.
This area is equal to half the total area:
$\frac{1}{2} (b_2 + x) h' = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) h = \frac{1}{4} (b_1 + b_2) h$.

Substitute $h' = h \frac{x - b_2}{b_1 - b_2}$:
$\frac{1}{2} (b_2 + x) h \frac{x - b_2}{b_1 - b_2} = \frac{1}{4} (b_1 + b_2) h$
$(b_2 + x)(x - b_2) = \frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) (b_1 - b_2)$
$x^2 - b_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} (b_1^2 - b_2^2)$
$2x^2 - 2b_2^2 = b_1^2 - b_2^2$
$2x^2 = b_1^2 + b_2^2$

This formula seems to apply when the segment divides the area in half. Let's re-read the question carefully.

Let the segment of length $x$ divide the trapezoid into two regions of equal area.
The area of the upper part is $\frac{1}{2} (b_2 + x) h'$, where $h'$ is the height of this part.
The area of the total trapezoid is $\frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) h$.
We are given that $\frac{1}{2} (b_2 + x) h' = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total Area} = \frac{1}{4} (b_1 + b_2) h$.

We have the relationship between $x$ and $h'$:
$\frac{x - b_2}{h'} = \frac{b_1 - b_2}{h}$, so $h' = h \frac{x - b_2}{b_1 - b_2}$.

Substitute this into the area equation:
$\frac{1}{2} (b_2 + x) h \frac{x - b_2}{b_1 - b_2} = \frac{1}{4} (b_1 + b_2) h$
$(b_2 + x)(x - b_2) = \frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) (b_1 - b_2)$
$x^2 - b_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} (b_1^2 - b_2^2)$
$2x^2 - 2b_2^2 = b_1^2 - b_2^2$
$2x^2 = b_1^2 + b_2^2$

Using $b_1 = 175$ and $b_2 = 75$:
$2x^2 = (175)^2 + (75)^2$
$2x^2 = 30625 + 5625 = 36250$
$x^2 = \frac{36250}{2} = 18125$.

This confirms the value of $x^2$.

Now, we need to find the greatest integer that does not exceed $x^2/100$.
$\frac{x^2}{100} = \frac{18125}{100} = 181.25$.
The greatest integer that does not exceed $181.25$ is $\lfloor 181.25 \rfloor = 181$.

Let's verify the formula used for the length of the segment dividing the area in a certain ratio.
Suppose a line parallel to the bases divides the trapezoid into two trapezoids with areas in the ratio $m:n$. Let the length of the dividing segment be $y$.

Consider the case where the areas are equal.
We have $\frac{1}{2} (b_2 + y) h_1 = \frac{1}{2} (y + b_1) h_2$, with $h_1 + h_2 = h$.
Also, $\frac{y - b_2}{h_1} = \frac{b_1 - b_2}{h}$ and $\frac{b_1 - y}{h_2} = \frac{b_1 - b_2}{h}$.
So, $h_1 = h \frac{y - b_2}{b_1 - b_2}$ and $h_2 = h \frac{b_1 - y}{b_1 - b_2}$.
$h_1 = h_2 \implies y - b_2 = b_1 - y \implies 2y = b_1 + b_2 \implies y = \frac{b_1 + b_2}{2}$, which is the midline. This seems wrong.

Let the height of the upper trapezoid be $h'$. The length of the dividing segment is $y$.
Area of upper trapezoid = $\frac{1}{2} (b_2 + y) h'$.
Total area = $\frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) h$.
If the dividing segment creates two equal areas, then $\frac{1}{2} (b_2 + y) h' = \frac{1}{4} (b_1 + b_2) h$.

We have $\frac{y - b_2}{h'} = \frac{b_1 - b_2}{h}$, so $h' = h \frac{y - b_2}{b_1 - b_2}$.
$\frac{1}{2} (b_2 + y) h \frac{y - b_2}{b_1 - b_2} = \frac{1}{4} (b_1 + b_2) h$
$(y + b_2)(y - b_2) = \frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) (b_1 - b_2)$
$y^2 - b_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} (b_1^2 - b_2^2)$
$2y^2 - 2b_2^2 = b_1^2 - b_2^2$
$2y^2 = b_1^2 + b_2^2$.
So, $y = \sqrt{\frac{b_1^2 + b_2^2}{2}}$.

This is the length of the segment that divides the trapezoid into two equal areas. In the problem, this length is $x$.
So, $x^2 = \frac{b_1^2 + b_2^2}{2}$.

Let's verify this using integration.
Consider a trapezoid with vertices $(0, 0), (w, 0), (a, h), (b, h)$, where $w$ is the width of the base $b_2$, and the top base $b_1$ has width $|b - a|$.
Assume the trapezoid has vertices $(0, 0), (b_2, 0), (a, h), (a + b_1 - b_2, h)$.
Equation of the left leg: $y = \frac{h}{a} x$.
Equation of the right leg: $y = \frac{h}{b_1 - b_2} (x - b_2)$.

Consider a vertical line at height $y'$, the width of the trapezoid at this height is $w(y') = b_2 + (b_1 - b_2) \frac{y'}{h}$.
Let the dividing line be at height $y_0$.
Area up to $y_0$: $\int_0^{y_0} w(y) dy = \int_0^{y_0} \left( b_2 + (b_1 - b_2) \frac{y}{h} \right) dy$
$= \left[ b_2 y + (b_1 - b_2) \frac{y^2}{2h} \right]_0^{y_0} = b_2 y_0 + (b_1 - b_2) \frac{y_0^2}{2h}$.

The length of the segment at height $y_0$ is $x = b_2 + (b_1 - b_2) \frac{y_0}{h}$.

If the segment divides the area in half, then
$b_2 y_0 + (b_1 - b_2) \frac{y_0^2}{2h} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) h = \frac{1}{4} (b_1 + b_2) h$.

This seems more complicated than the trapezoid area formula.

Final check:
Given $b_1 = b_2 + 100$.
Midline divides into regions with area ratio $2:3$.
$\frac{\frac{h}{8}(b_1 + 3b_2)}{\frac{h}{8}(3b_1 + b_2)} = \frac{2}{3} \implies 3(b_1 + 3b_2) = 2(3b_1 + b_2) \implies 7b_2 = 3b_1$.
$7b_2 = 3(b_2 + 100) \implies 4b_2 = 300 \implies b_2 = 75$, $b_1 = 175$.

Segment of length $x$ divides into equal areas.
$x^2 = \frac{b_1^2 + b_2^2}{2} = \frac{175^2 + 75^2}{2} = \frac{30625 + 5625}{2} = \frac{36250}{2} = 18125$.

$\frac{x^2}{100} = \frac{18125}{100} = 181.25$.
Greatest integer not exceeding $181.25$ is $181$.
