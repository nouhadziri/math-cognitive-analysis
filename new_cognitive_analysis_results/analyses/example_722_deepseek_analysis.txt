Problem:
The Chi-square statistic $\chi^2=\sum_c\frac{(P(x)-Q(x))^2}{Q(x)}$ is (twice) the first term in the Taylor series expansion of $D(P||Q)$ about $Q$. True or False?

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to figure out if the statement that the Chi-square statistic is twice the first term in the Taylor series expansion of the Kullback-Leibler divergence \( D(P||Q) \) around \( Q \) is true or false. Let me try to recall what I know about these concepts.

First, the Kullback-Leibler divergence, or KL divergence, is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from another. Given two distributions \( P \) and \( Q \), the KL divergence is defined as:

$$
D(P||Q) = \sum_{x} P(x) \log \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}
$$

Right? And it's not symmetric, meaning \( D(P||Q) \neq D(Q||P) \) in general.

On the other hand, the Chi-square statistic is another measure of the discrepancy between two distributions. The formula given here is:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum_{c} \frac{(P(x) - Q(x))^2}{Q(x)}
$$

This looks familiar. The Chi-square statistic typically compares observed frequencies to expected frequencies, so in this case, maybe \( P(x) \) represents the observed probability and \( Q(x) \) the expected one.

Now, the question is stating that this Chi-square statistic is equal to twice the first term in the Taylor series expansion of \( D(P||Q) \) about \( Q \). So, first, I need to recall what a Taylor series expansion is in multiple variables or for functions of distributions.

Since KL divergence is a function of two distributions, expanding it around \( Q \) would mean that we consider \( P \) to be close to \( Q \), right? So, maybe we can parameterize \( P \) in terms of \( Q \) plus a small perturbation. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe we can expand \( D(P||Q) \) as a function of \( P \) around the point \( P = Q \). If \( P \) is near \( Q \), then \( P(x) = Q(x) + \epsilon(x) \), where \( \epsilon(x) \) is a small perturbation such that the sum of \( \epsilon(x) \) over all \( x \) is zero (since both \( P \) and \( Q \) are probability distributions).

So, let me try to expand \( D(P||Q) \) in terms of \( \epsilon(x) \).

First, substituting \( P(x) = Q(x) + \epsilon(x) \):

$$
D(P||Q) = \sum_{x} (Q(x) + \epsilon(x)) \log \left( \frac{Q(x) + \epsilon(x)}{Q(x)} \right)
$$

Simplify the logarithm term:

$$
\log \left( 1 + \frac{\epsilon(x)}{Q(x)} \right)
$$

Assuming \( \epsilon(x) \) is small, we can use the Taylor series expansion for \( \log(1 + y) \approx y - \frac{y^2}{2} + \frac{y^3}{3} - \dots \), so up to the second order, this is:

$$
\frac{\epsilon(x)}{Q(x)} - \frac{(\epsilon(x))^2}{2 Q(x)^2} + \dots
$$

Therefore, substituting back into \( D(P||Q) \):

$$
\sum_{x} (Q(x) + \epsilon(x)) \left( \frac{\epsilon(x)}{Q(x)} - \frac{(\epsilon(x))^2}{2 Q(x)^2} \right) + \dots
$$

Let me multiply out these terms step by step.

First term in the expansion:

\( (Q(x) + \epsilon(x)) \cdot \frac{\epsilon(x)}{Q(x)} = \epsilon(x) + \frac{(\epsilon(x))^2}{Q(x)} \)

Second term:

\( (Q(x) + \epsilon(x)) \cdot \left( - \frac{(\epsilon(x))^2}{2 Q(x)^2} \right ) = - \frac{(\epsilon(x))^2}{2 Q(x)} - \frac{(\epsilon(x))^3}{2 Q(x)^2} \)

But since \( \epsilon(x) \) is small, the cubic term \( \frac{(\epsilon(x))^3}{Q(x)^2} \) can be neglected in the expansion. So combining these, we have:

First order: \( \epsilon(x) \)

Second order: \( \frac{(\epsilon(x))^2}{Q(x)} - \frac{(\epsilon(x))^2}{2 Q(x)} = \frac{(\epsilon(x))^2}{2 Q(x)} \)

Therefore, putting it all together, the expansion becomes:

$$
D(P||Q) \approx \sum_{x} \epsilon(x) + \frac{(\epsilon(x))^2}{2 Q(x)}
$$

But wait a second, \( \sum_{x} \epsilon(x) \) is the sum of the differences between \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \). Since both \( P \) and \( Q \) are probability distributions, their total probabilities sum to 1. Therefore:

$$
\sum_{x} \epsilon(x) = \sum_{x} (P(x) - Q(x)) = 1 - 1 = 0
$$

Therefore, the first-order term cancels out. So the next term in the expansion would be the second-order term:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{x} \frac{(\epsilon(x))^2}{Q(x)} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{x} \frac{(P(x) - Q(x))^2}{Q(x)}
$$

Which is \( \frac{1}{2} \chi^2 \), right? Because the Chi-square statistic is \( \sum \frac{(P(x) - Q(x))^2}{Q(x)} \). Therefore, the second-order term in the Taylor expansion of \( D(P||Q) \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \chi^2 \).

But the question says the Chi-square statistic is twice the first term in the Taylor series expansion. Wait, but is this the first non-zero term or the actual first term? Because the first term involving \( \epsilon(x) \) cancels out, so the first non-zero term is the second-order term. Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{1}{2} \chi^2 \). Therefore, if the question is referring to the first non-zero term in the Taylor expansion, then yes, twice that term would be \( \chi^2 \). However, the question is phrased as "the first term in the Taylor series expansion".

But in Taylor series, typically the "first term" is the zeroth order term, then first order, and so on. Let's see.

But here, when expanding \( D(P||Q) \) around \( P = Q \), the zeroth order term is when \( P = Q \), so it would be \( D(Q||Q) \), which is zero. Then, the first-order linear term is the first derivative term, which we computed as \( \sum \epsilon(x) \), which is zero. Then the second-order term is the quadratic term \( \frac{1}{2} \chi^2 \).

But according to the question, the Chi-square statistic is twice the first term. The "first term" here might be ambiguous. The Taylor series expansion of \( D(P||Q) \) up to second order is \( 0 + 0 + \frac{1}{2} \chi^2 + \dots \), so the first non-zero term is \( \frac{1}{2} \chi^2 \), which is the second-order term.

However, if the question counts the terms as the first term (zeroth order), second term (first order), etc., then the first non-zero term is indeed the second-order term, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \chi^2 \), in which case twice that is \( \chi^2 \), which would mean the statement is True.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the expansion in some other parameterization? For example, maybe by using another variable. Let me check.

Alternatively, some sources might instead write the KL divergence as a function of the ratio \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), and do the expansion around 1. Let me see.

Define \( t(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} - 1 \), so when \( P(x) = Q(x) \), \( t(x) = 0 \). Then,

\( D(P||Q) = \sum Q(x) (1 + t(x)) \log(1 + t(x)) \)

Expanding \( (1 + t(x)) \log(1 + t(x)) \) around \( t(x) = 0 \):

Let me compute the Taylor expansion of \( (1 + t) \log(1 + t) \).

First, let \( f(t) = (1 + t) \log(1 + t) \).

Find the expansion around t=0:

First, compute f(0) = 1*log(1) = 0

f'(t) = \log(1 + t) + (1 + t)*(1/(1 + t)) ) = \log(1 + t) + 1

So f'(0) = 0 + 1 = 1

f''(t) = 1/(1 + t) + 0 = 1/(1 + t)

f''(0) = 1

f'''(t) = -1/(1 + t)^2

So the Taylor series up to the second order is:

f(t) = f(0) + f'(0) t + (1/2) f''(0) t^2 + ...

Thus,

f(t) ≈ t + (1/2) t^2 - (1/6) t^3 + ...

Therefore,

\( D(P||Q) = \sum Q(x) [ t(x) + (1/2) t(x)^2 - (1/6) t(x)^3 + \dots ] \)

But since \( t(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} - 1 = \frac{P(x) - Q(x)}{Q(x)} \)

Therefore, \( t(x) = \frac{\epsilon(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( \epsilon(x) = P(x) - Q(x) \).

Therefore,

D(P||Q) ≈ sum Q(x) [ t(x) + (1/2) t(x)^2 ] = sum Q(x) [ \(\frac{\epsilon(x)}{Q(x)}\) + (1/2) \(\frac{\epsilon(x)^2}{Q(x)^2}\) ]

Simplify term by term:

First term: sum Q(x) * ( \epsilon(x)/Q(x) ) = sum \epsilon(x) = 0

Second term: sum Q(x) * (1/2 (epsilon(x)^2/Q(x)^2)) ) = (1/2) sum (epsilon(x)^2 / Q(x)) = (1/2) χ^2

So again, same result: KL divergence up to second order is approximately (1/2) χ^2.

Therefore, the first non-vanishing term in the expansion is (1/2) χ^2, so twice that term would be the χ^2 itself.

But the question says: "the Chi-square statistic is (twice) the first term in the Taylor series expansion". It's (twice). The wording is a bit confusing. Is it saying that χ2 is twice the first term? So "the Chi-square statistic is twice the first term in the Taylor series expansion".

Yes, according to what we computed, the first non-zero term in the expansion is (1/2) χ2, so twice that is χ2, which matches the original Chi-square statistic. Therefore, that would mean the statement is True.

But perhaps to confirm, let me also check another reference. For example, from Cover and Thomas's Elements of Information Theory, there is a relationship between KL divergence and other divergence measures. In particular, it's mentioned that the KL divergence can be approximated by (1/2) χ2 when the distributions are close. Similarly, the χ2 divergence is a second-order approximation of twice the KL divergence.

Wait, is the opposite direction true as well? For example, depending on the direction of the KL divergence.

Hold on, in our case, the KL divergence \( D(P||Q) \) is approximately (1/2) χ2 when P is close to Q.

But the Chi-squared divergence is defined as \( \chi^2 = \sum \frac{(P(x) - Q(x))^2}{Q(x)} \), so in this case, yes, we have the KL divergence D(P||Q) is approximately (1/2)χ2, so the Chi-square is twice the KL divergence in this approximation.

Alternatively, sometimes people define χ2 differently, but here the given formula is exactly the standard Pearson's Chi-squared statistic. Therefore, based on our calculation, the answer is True.

So to make sure there's no trick here. The question is: "The Chi-square statistic ... is (twice) the first term in the Taylor series expansion of D(P||Q) about Q. True or False?"

If the first term in the Taylor expansion is considered to be the zeroth order term, but since the first few terms up to first order cancel, maybe the "first term" refers to the leading term? But technically, the Taylor series expansion is an infinite series consisting of terms of increasing order, each multiplied by higher powers of (variable - point of expansion). So each term in the expansion is an order of the approximation.

In our case, the first term (n=0, constant term) is zero, since D(Q||Q)=0. The next term (n=1, linear term) is also zero. The term after that (n=2, quadratic term) is (1/2)χ2. Therefore, if "twice the first term" refers to twice the first non-zero term, which is (1/2)χ2, then it's correct. So, interpreting the question as such, it's True.

Alternatively, if "first term" is meant to be the first term in the expansion regardless of it being zero, then it's not. But I think in the context of expansions, people usually refer to leading non-zero terms when they talk about the first term. Because otherwise, statements like "the first term in the expansion of cosine is 1" even though the first term is actually the zeroth degree term. So in that sense, maybe even in higher order math, the terminology might have ambiguity.

However, given that in our calculation, the first non-vanishing term is the quadratic term (1/2)χ2, and that twice that would be χ2, which is the given Chi-square statistic. So the statement is True.

Therefore, I think the answer is True.
