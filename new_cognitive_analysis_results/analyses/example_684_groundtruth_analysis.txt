Problem:
Twenty five of King Arthur's knights are seated at their customary round table. Three of them are chosen - all choices being equally likely - and are sent off to slay a troublesome dragon. Let $P$ be the probability that at least two of the three had been sitting next to each other. If $P$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?

<text>Twenty five of King Arthur's knights are seated at their customary round table. Three of them are chosen - all choices being equally likely - and are sent off to slay a troublesome dragon. Let $P$ be the probability that at least two of the three had been sitting next to each other. If $P$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?</text>
<explanation>The solver has understood that this is a probability problem involving a selection of 3 knights from 25 seated at a round table. They recognized that they need to find the probability P that at least 2 of the 3 selected knights were sitting next to each other, and then express this as a fraction in lowest terms to find the sum of numerator and denominator.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver has arrived at the answer 57, which suggests they calculated a probability fraction whose numerator and denominator sum to 57. This indicates they worked through the probability calculation correctly, determining both the total number of possible ways to select 3 knights from 25 and the number of favorable outcomes where at least 2 knights are adjacent.</explanation>

<text>57</text>
<explanation>To arrive at this answer, the solver would have needed to count the total number of ways to select 3 knights from 25 (using combinations) and count the number of ways to select at least 2 adjacent knights. This requires understanding how to count arrangements in a circular setting and potentially using the principle of inclusion-exclusion to handle cases with multiple adjacent pairs.</explanation>

<definition>The ability to reason about objects arranged in a circle, recognizing the special properties and counting techniques that apply to circular arrangements.</definition>

<end>57</end>
<text>57</text>
<explanation>The problem involves knights seated at a round table, which requires understanding how adjacency works in a circular arrangement. The solver would have needed to recognize that in a circular arrangement of 25 knights, there are exactly 25 pairs of adjacent positions, and this affects how to count favorable outcomes.</explanation>

<skill>Fraction Simplification</skill>

<start>0</start>

<explanation>The final answer 57 suggests the solver found a probability fraction, reduced it to lowest terms, and then added the numerator and denominator. This requires understanding how to simplify fractions by finding the GCD and dividing both terms by it.</explanation>

<definition>The ability to break down a complex problem into simpler, more manageable sub-problems that can be solved independently.</definition>

<explanation>To solve this problem, the solver would have needed to decompose it into: (1) finding the total number of ways to select 3 knights from 25, (2) finding the number of ways to select 3 knights such that at least 2 are adjacent, (3) calculating the probability, and (4) simplifying the fraction and finding the sum. This demonstrates strategic problem decomposition.</explanation>
