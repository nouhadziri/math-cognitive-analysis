Find all  $f: H \to \Bbb R$  continuous functions for which  $$ f(x + y + \pi z) + f(x + \sqrt{2} z) + f(y + \sqrt{2} z) + f (\pi z) $$    $$ = f(x + y + \sqrt{2} z) + f (x + \pi z) + f (y + \pi z) + f(\sqrt{2} z) $$  is satisfied for any  $x , y , z \in H$ .



Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Substitution and Definitions**:
   Let \( u = \pi \) and \( v = \sqrt{2} \). For each \( z \in H \), define:
   \[
   g_z(t) = f(t + uz) - f(t + vz)
   \]
   and
   \[
   h_z(t) = g_z(t) - g_z(0).
   \]

2. **Properties of \( g_z \) and \( h_z \)**:
   We have:
   \[
   g_z(x + y) + g_z(0) = g_z(x) + g_z(y)
   \]
   which implies:
   \[
   h_z(x + y) = h_z(x) + h_z(y).
   \]
   By the standard argument, \( h_z \) is \(\mathbb{Q}\)-linear and, since \( h_z \) is continuous, it is also \(\mathbb{R}\)-linear.

3. **Riesz Representation Theorem**:
   By the Riesz representation theorem, there exists \( r_z \in H \) such that:
   \[
   h_z(t) = \langle r_z, t \rangle
   \]
   for all \( t \in H \), where \( \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle \) is the inner product in \( H \).

4. **Expression for \( g_z \)**:
   Let \( c_z = g_z(0) \). Then:
   \[
   f(t + uz) - f(t + vz) = g_z(t) = c_z + \langle r_z, t \rangle.
   \]

5. **Functional Equation**:
   For any \( t, z, w \in H \), we have:
   \[
   f(t + u(z + w)) - f(t + v(z + w)) = (f((t + uz) + uw) - f((t + uz) + vw)) + (f((t + vw) + uz) - f((t + vw) + vz)).
   \]
   This gives:
   \[
   c_{z + w} + \langle r_{z + w}, t \rangle = c_w + \langle r_w, t + uz \rangle + c_z + \langle r_z, t + vw \rangle.
   \]
   Since this holds for all \( t \in H \), we conclude:
   \[
   c_{z + w} = c_z + c_w + u \langle r_w, z \rangle + v \langle r_z, w \rangle,
   \]
   and
   \[
   r_{z + w} = r_z + r_w.
   \]

6. **Symmetry and Linearity**:
   Exchanging \( z \) and \( w \) in the equation for \( c_{z + w} \) gives:
   \[
   \langle r_w, z \rangle = \langle r_z, w \rangle.
   \]
   For any \( \lambda \in \mathbb{R} \), we have:
   \[
   \langle \lambda r_z, w \rangle = \lambda \langle r_z, w \rangle = \lambda \langle r_w, z \rangle = \langle r_w, \lambda z \rangle = \langle r_{\lambda z}, w \rangle.
   \]
   Taking \( w = r_{\lambda z} - \lambda r_z \) shows that \( r_{\lambda z} = \lambda r_z \) for all \( \lambda \in \mathbb{R} \) and all \( z \in H \).

7. **Linearity and Continuity**:
   Combined with the additivity property, we see that the map \( z \mapsto r_z \) is an \(\mathbb{R}\)-linear map from \( H \) to \( H \). It is also symmetric, hence by the Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem, it is continuous, i.e., a self-adjoint operator on \( H \).

8. **Rewriting \( c_{z + w} \)**:
   Now, the equation for \( c_{z + w} \) can be rewritten as:
   \[
   c_{z + w} = c_z + c_w + (u + v) \langle r_z, w \rangle.
   \]
   If we write \( d_z = c_z - \frac{u + v}{2} \langle r_z, z \rangle \), which is again continuous in \( z \), then the above equality becomes:
   \[
   d_{z + w} = d_z + d_w.
   \]
   It follows that the map \( z \mapsto d_z \) is a continuous \(\mathbb{R}\)-linear map from \( H \) to \(\mathbb{R}\).

9. **Final Form of \( f \)**:
   In the expression for \( g_z \), replace \( t \) with \( -vz \):
   \[
   f((u - v)z) = f(0) + c_z - v \langle r_z, z \rangle = f(0) + \frac{u - v}{2} \langle r_z, z \rangle + d_z.
   \]
   Replacing \( z \) with \( \frac{z}{u - v} \), we get:
   \[
   f(z) = f(0) + \frac{1}{2(u - v)} \langle r_z, z \rangle + \frac{1}{u - v} d_z.
   \]

10. **Conclusion**:
    In conclusion, we have:
    \[
    f(z) = a + b(z) + \langle c(z), z \rangle
    \]
    where:
    - \( a \) is a real number,
    - \( b: H \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a continuous linear functional on \( H \),
    - \( c: H \rightarrow H \) is a continuous self-adjoint operator on \( H \).

    Conversely, it is easy to verify that any function \( f \) of the above form satisfies the required identity.

The final answer is \( \boxed{ f(z) = a + b(z) + \langle c(z), z \rangle } \).
