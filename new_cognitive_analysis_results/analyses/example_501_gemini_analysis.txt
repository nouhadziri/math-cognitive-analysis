Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let $G$ be a subgroup of $GL_2(\mathbb{C})$ with $|G| = n$, where $n \geq 4$ is an even natural number.
We need to prove that there exists a subgroup $H$ of $G$ such that $\{I_2\} \neq H$ and $H \neq G$, and $XYX^{-1} \in H$ for all $X \in G$ and for all $Y \in H$.
This condition $XYX^{-1} \in H$ for all $X \in G$ and for all $Y \in H$ means that $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
We need to find a non-trivial proper normal subgroup of $G$.

Since $|G| = n$ is an even number, we know from Cauchy's theorem that there exists an element of order 2 in $G$. Let $g \in G$ such that the order of $g$ is 2, i.e., $g^2 = I_2$ and $g \neq I_2$.
Consider the subgroup generated by $g$, denoted by $\langle g \rangle = \{I_2, g\}$. Since $g \neq I_2$, $\langle g \rangle \neq \{I_2\}$. Since $n \geq 4$, $\langle g \rangle \neq G$.
We need to check if $\langle g \rangle$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
For any $X \in G$ and $Y \in \langle g \rangle$, we need to check if $XYX^{-1} \in \langle g \rangle$.
If $Y = I_2$, then $XI_2X^{-1} = XX^{-1} = I_2 \in \langle g \rangle$.
If $Y = g$, then we need to check if $XgX^{-1} \in \langle g \rangle$.
This is true if and only if $XgX^{-1} = I_2$ or $XgX^{-1} = g$.
$XgX^{-1} = I_2 \implies g = X^{-1}I_2X = I_2$, which is a contradiction since the order of $g$ is 2.
So we need to check if $XgX^{-1} = g$. This is equivalent to $Xg = gX$.
This means that for $\langle g \rangle$ to be a normal subgroup, every element of $G$ must commute with $g$. This is not necessarily true.

Let's consider the center of $G$, denoted by $Z(G) = \{g \in G \mid gx = xg \text{ for all } x \in G\}$.
$Z(G)$ is a subgroup of $G$. For any $h \in Z(G)$ and $X \in G$, we have $XhX^{-1} = hX X^{-1} = h \in Z(G)$. So $Z(G)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
If $Z(G) \neq \{I_2\}$ and $Z(G) \neq G$, then we can choose $H = Z(G)$.
If $G$ is abelian, then $Z(G) = G$, which is not allowed.

Consider the case when $n=4$. Possible groups are $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{2}_2$.
If $G = \mathbb{Z}_4$, it is abelian, so every subgroup is normal. The subgroups are $\{0\}$, $\{0, 2\}$, $\{0, 1, 2, 3\}$. $H = \{0, 2\}$ is a non-trivial proper normal subgroup.
If $G = \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 = \{(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)\}$. It is abelian, so every subgroup is normal. The subgroups are $\{(0,0)\}$, $\{(0,0), (1,0)\}$, $\{(0,0), (0,1)\}$, $\{(0,0), (1,1)\}$, $\{(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)\}$. We can choose $H = \{(0,0), (1,0)\}$.

We know that for any group $G$, the center $Z(G)$ is a normal subgroup.
If $Z(G) \neq \{I_2\}$, then we can choose $H = Z(G)$. If $Z(G) \neq G$, then $H$ is a proper non-trivial normal subgroup.
If $Z(G) = G$, then $G$ is abelian. In this case, any subgroup is a normal subgroup. Since $|G| = n \geq 4$ is even, by Cauchy's theorem, there exists an element $g \in G$ of order 2. The subgroup generated by $g$, $\langle g \rangle$, has order 2, so $\langle g \rangle \neq \{I_2\}$. Since $|G| \geq 4$, $\langle g \rangle \neq G$. Since $G$ is abelian, $\langle g \rangle$ is a normal subgroup.

The case remaining is when $Z(G) = \{I_2\}$.
Since $|G|$ is even, there exists an element $g \in G$ of order 2.
Consider the conjugation action of $G$ on itself. This action partitions $G$ into conjugacy classes. The size of the conjugacy class of an element $a \in G$ is $|G|/|C_G(a)|$, where $C_G(a) = \{x \in G \mid xa = ax\}$ is the centralizer of $a$ in $G$.
The class equation is $|G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_{i} [G:C_G(g_i)]$, where the sum is over representatives $g_i$ of the non-singleton conjugacy classes.
Since $Z(G) = \{I_2\}$, we have $|G| = 1 + \sum_{i} [G:C_G(g_i)]$.
Since $|G|$ is even, $\sum_{i} [G:C_G(g_i)]$ is odd. This means that at least one of the terms $[G:C_G(g_i)]$ must be odd.
$[G:C_G(g_i)] = |G|/|C_G(g_i)|$. Since $|G|$ is even, for $[G:C_G(g_i)]$ to be odd, $|C_G(g_i)|$ must have a higher power of 2 in its prime factorization than $|G|$. This is not possible since $C_G(g_i)$ is a subgroup of $G$.

Let's reconsider the case when $G$ is abelian. If $G$ is abelian, any subgroup is normal. Since $|G| = n \geq 4$ is even, by Cauchy's theorem, there exists an element $g \in G$ with order 2. The subgroup $H = \langle g \rangle = \{I_2, g\}$ is a normal subgroup. $H \neq \{I_2\}$ because $g \neq I_2$. $H \neq G$ because $|H| = 2 < |G| = n \geq 4$.

Now consider the case when $G$ is non-abelian.
The center $Z(G)$ is a normal subgroup. If $Z(G)$ is non-trivial, i.e., $Z(G) \neq \{I_2\}$, and $Z(G) \neq G$, then we can set $H = Z(G)$.
If $Z(G) = G$, then $G$ is abelian, which is a contradiction.
If $Z(G) = \{I_2\}$.

Consider the case when $n=6$. Possible non-abelian group is $S_3$. $|S_3| = 6$. The normal subgroups of $S_3$ are $\{e\}$ and $A_3$. $A_3$ has order 3.
Let's take a subgroup of order 2. Let $g$ be an element of order 2. The subgroup $\langle g \rangle$ is not necessarily normal.

Let's think about the structure of $GL_2(\mathbb{C})$.
If $G$ is a subgroup of $GL_2(\mathbb{C})$, and $|G|$ is even.
Consider the determinant map $\det: G \to \mathbb{C}^*$. The image of this map, $\det(G)$, is a subgroup of $\mathbb{C}^*$. The kernel of this map is $SL_2(\mathbb{C}) \cap G$, which is a normal subgroup of $G$.
Let $K = \ker(\det|_G) = \{ A \in G \mid \det(A) = 1 \}$.
$K$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
If $K \neq \{I_2\}$ and $K \neq G$, then we can choose $H = K$.
If $K = \{I_2\}$, then for all $A \in G$, $\det(A) = 1$. This means $G \subseteq SL_2(\mathbb{C})$.
If $K = G$, then for all $A \in G$, $\det(A) = 1$.

If $\det(g) \neq 1$ for some $g \in G$, then $K$ is a proper subgroup.
If $K = \{I_2\}$, then every non-identity element has determinant not equal to 1.
If $\det(A) = 1$ for all $A \in G$, then $G \subseteq SL_2(\mathbb{C})$.

If $G$ is abelian, we have already shown the existence of $H$.
Assume $G$ is non-abelian.
Consider the commutator subgroup $[G, G]$, which is a normal subgroup of $G$.
If $[G, G] \neq \{I_2\}$ and $[G, G] \neq G$, we can choose $H = [G, G]$.
If $[G, G] = \{I_2\}$, then $xyx^{-1}y^{-1} = e$ for all $x, y \in G$, which implies $xy = yx$, so $G$ is abelian, a contradiction.
If $[G, G] = G$, then this does not give us information directly.

Let $n = 2k$ for some integer $k \geq 2$.
Since $|G|$ is even, by Cauchy's theorem, there exists an element $g \in G$ of order 2.
Consider the centralizer of $g$, $C_G(g) = \{x \in G \mid xg = gx\}$. This is a subgroup of $G$.
The size of the conjugacy class of $g$ is $[G:C_G(g)] = |G|/|C_G(g)|$.
The conjugacy class of $g$ is $\{xgx^{-1} \mid x \in G\}$.
If $C_G(g) = G$, then $g \in Z(G)$. If $Z(G) \neq G$, we are done.

Let $g \in G$ be an element of order 2.
Consider the normal closure of $\langle g \rangle$, which is the smallest normal subgroup containing $\langle g \rangle$. This is given by $\langle \langle g \rangle \rangle = \bigcap_{g \in N, N \trianglelefteq G} N$.
Alternatively, $\langle \langle g \rangle \rangle$ is generated by $\{xgx^{-1} \mid x \in G\}$.
If $\langle \langle g \rangle \rangle \neq G$, and $\langle \langle g \rangle \rangle \neq \{I_2\}$, we are done.
Since $g \in \langle \langle g \rangle \rangle$, and $g \neq I_2$, we have $\langle \langle g \rangle \rangle \neq \{I_2\}$.
We need to show that $\langle \langle g \rangle \rangle \neq G$.

Consider the case when $|G| = 4$. $G$ is either $\mathbb{Z}_4$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$. Both are abelian, so any non-trivial proper subgroup is a normal subgroup.

Consider the structure of finite subgroups of $GL_2(\mathbb{C})$.
If $G$ is a finite subgroup of $GL_2(\mathbb{C})$, then $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $O(3)$ or $SU(2)$.

If $G$ has a normal subgroup $N$ with $1 < |N| < |G|$, we are done.
If $G$ is simple, then its only normal subgroups are $\{I_2\}$ and $G$.
If $|G|$ is an even number greater than 2, and $G$ is simple, then by Burnside's Theorem, $|G|$ must be divisible by at most two primes.
If $|G|$ is an even simple group, then $|G|$ is the order of a simple group. The smallest even order of a non-abelian simple group is 60 ($A_5$).
Since $n \geq 4$, if $4 \leq n < 60$, and $n$ is even, if $G$ is simple, we have a contradiction.
So if $4 \leq n < 60$ and $n$ is even, $G$ must have a non-trivial proper normal subgroup.

If $n \geq 60$, this argument does not work.

Let's use the fact that $n$ is even.
There exists an element $g \in G$ of order 2.
Consider the map $\phi_g: G \to G$ defined by $\phi_g(x) = gxg^{-1}$.
Since $g^2 = I_2$, $g^{-1} = g$. So $\phi_g(x) = gxg$.
$\phi_g^2(x) = \phi_g(gxg) = g(gxg)g = g^2xg^2 = I_2 x I_2 = x$.
So $\phi_g$ is an automorphism of order 2.

Consider the center $Z(G)$. If $1 < |Z(G)| < |G|$, then $H = Z(G)$ works.
If $Z(G) = G$, then $G$ is abelian, and any subgroup works.
If $Z(G) = \{I_2\}$.

If $n \geq 4$ is even, then $n = 2m$ for $m \geq 2$.
If $G$ has a subgroup of index 2, that subgroup is normal.
Consider the case when $G$ does not have a subgroup of index 2. This means the order of $G$ is not divisible by the smallest prime dividing the order of $G$.

Let's consider the determinant map $\det: G \to \mathbb{C}^*$.
The image $\det(G)$ is a finite subgroup of $\mathbb{C}^*$, so it is a cyclic group of order $k$, where $k$ divides $n$.
The kernel $K = \ker(\det)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
If $1 < |K| < |G|$, we are done.
$|G/K| = |\det(G)| = k$.
If $k = 1$, then $\det(g) = 1$ for all $g \in G$, so $G \subseteq SL_2(\mathbb{C})$. Then $K = G$.
If $k = n$, then the map is injective, $\det(g_1) = \det(g_2) \implies g_1 = g_2$.
If $k > 1$, then $|K| = n/k < n$.
If $|K| > 1$, then we have a non-trivial proper normal subgroup.
We need to show that if $G$ is a subgroup of $GL_2(\mathbb{C})$ of even order, then there exists an element with determinant not equal to 1, unless $G \subseteq SL_2(\mathbb{C})$.

If there exists $g \in G$ such that $\det(g) \neq 1$, then the kernel of $\det|_G$ is a proper normal subgroup.
Since $|G|$ is even, there exists an element of order 2, say $a$.
If $\det(a) \neq 1$, then $\det(a) = -1$ since $a^2 = I_2$, so $\det(a)^2 = \det(I_2) = 1$.
If there exists an element $g \in G$ with $\det(g) \neq \pm 1$, then the order of $\det(g)$ is greater than 2, so $|\det(G)| > 2$, and the kernel has order less than $n$.
If for all $g \in G$, $\det(g) = \pm 1$.
The set of elements with determinant 1 is the kernel $K$.
The set of elements with determinant -1 is a coset of $K$.
Since $|G|$ is even, the number of elements with determinant 1 is $|K|$, and the number of elements with determinant -1 is also $|K|$.
Since there exists an element of order 2, if its determinant is -1, then $K$ is a proper subgroup.

If for all $g \in G$, $\det(g) = 1$, then $G \subseteq SL_2(\mathbb{C})$.
If for all $g \in G$, $\det(g) = \pm 1$.
Consider the map $\det: G \to \{1, -1\}$. This is a homomorphism.
The kernel is $\{g \in G \mid \det(g) = 1\}$, which is a normal subgroup.
Since $|G|$ is even, if there exists an element with determinant -1, then the kernel has index 2, so it is a normal subgroup.
We need to show that if $G$ has even order, and $G \not\subseteq SL_2(\mathbb{C})$, then there exists an element with determinant -1.
Let $g \in G$ such that $\det(g) \neq 1$. Since $g^{|G|} = I_2$, $\det(g)^{|G|} = 1$.
If $\det(g)$ is a root of unity other than 1.

If $G$ is a finite subgroup of $GL_2(\mathbb{C})$ of even order.
Consider the case when $G \subseteq SL_2(\mathbb{C})$.
If $G$ is abelian, we are done.
If $G$ is non-abelian, then the center $Z(G)$ is a non-trivial normal subgroup.
The center of a finite subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$ is $\{I_2, -I_2\}$ or trivial.
If $-I_2 \in G$, then $\{I_2, -I_2\}$ is a normal subgroup.

2. Case-based reasoning - The solver systematically breaks down the problem into cases (abelian vs. non-abelian groups, different group orders, etc.) and analyzes each separately.

3. Conceptual reformulation - The solver reframes the problem using different mathematical structures (center, determinant map, commutator subgroup, etc.) to gain new insights.

4. Verification and checking - The solver carefully verifies claims and checks conditions throughout the solution process, ensuring the validity of each step.

5. Pattern recognition - The solver identifies important structural patterns in group theory that guide the solution approach, such as properties of subgroups of specific indices and orders.
