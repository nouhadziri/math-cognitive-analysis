Problem:
Consider the following two person game. A number of pebbles are situated on the table. Two players make their moves alternately. A move consists of taking off the table  $x$  pebbles where  $x$  is the square of any positive integer. The player who is unable to make a move loses. Prove that there are infinitely many initial situations in which the second player can win no matter how his opponent plays.

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Define the Game and Initial Lists:**
   - We are given a game where two players alternately take \( x \) pebbles from a table, where \( x \) is the square of any positive integer.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - Define \( L \) as the list of numbers from which the first player loses. The list starts as \( 0, 2, 5, 7, \ldots \).
   - Define \( W \) as the list of numbers from which the first player wins. \( W \) is the complement of \( L \).

2. **Properties of \( W \) and \( L \):**
   - For each number \( w \) in \( W \), there must exist a number \( \ell \) in \( L \) such that \( w - \ell \) is a perfect square \( k^2 \).

3. **Assume \( L \) is Finite:**
   - Assume \( L \) is finite and let \( n \) be its largest element.

4. **Construct a New Element in \( L \):**
   - Consider the number \( n^2 + n + 1 \).
   - We need to show that \( n^2 + n + 1 \) must belong to \( L \).

5. **Verify \( n^2 + n + 1 \) Belongs to \( L \):**
   - Note that \( n^2 + n + 1 < (n+1)^2 \).
   - For \( n^2 + n + 1 \) to be in \( W \), there must exist a \( k \) such that \( n^2 + n + 1 - k^2 \) is in \( L \).
   - However, for \( k \leq n \), \( n^2 + n + 1 - k^2 > n \), which contradicts the assumption that \( n \) is the largest element in \( L \).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Since \( n^2 + n + 1 \) must belong to \( L \) and it is greater than \( n \), our assumption that \( L \) is finite is false.
   - Therefore, \( L \) must be infinite.
