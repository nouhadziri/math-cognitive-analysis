Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let $X$ be a set with $|X| \leq c$, where $c$ is the cardinality of the continuum.
Let $\tau$ be a metrizable topology on $X$.
We need to show that there exists a separable and metrizable topology $\tau'$ on $X$ such that $\tau' \subseteq \tau$.

However, we need $\tau'$ to be separable.

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a base for $\tau$. For each $B \in \mathcal{B}$, there exists a sequence of open balls whose union is $B$.

The function $f_{x, y}$ is continuous.

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for $\tau$.
For each pair of disjoint basic open sets $U, V \in \mathcal{B}$, by Urysohn's Lemma, there exists a continuous function $f_{U, V}: (X, \tau) \to [0, 1]$ such that $f_{U, V}(U) = \{0\}$ and $f_{U, V}(V) = \{1\}$.

Let $d$ be a metric for $\tau$.
Let $A \subseteq X$ be a countable subset.
Consider the collection of open balls $\{B_d(a, r) : a \in A, r \in \mathbb{Q}^+\}$. This is a countable collection of open sets in $\tau$.
Let $\tau'$ be the topology generated by this collection.
$\tau'$ is separable because $A$ is a countable dense set for $\tau'$.
$\tau'$ has a countable base, so it is metrizable.
However, $\tau'$ is not necessarily coarser than $\tau$.

Let $d$ be a metric for $\tau$.
Let $A \subseteq X$ be a countable subset.

Define $d'(x, y) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} \min(1, |f_n(x) - f_n(y)|)$.
The topology $\tau'$ induced by $d'$ is metrizable and coarser than $\tau$.
We need to show $\tau'$ is separable.

Let $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a countable family of continuous functions from $(X, \tau)$ to $[0, 1]$ that separates points.
Consider the map $e: X \to [0, 1]^{\mathbb{N}}$ defined by $e(x) = (f_1(x), f_2(x), \dots)$.
The map $e$ is an embedding of $(X, \tau')$ into $[0, 1]^{\mathbb{N}}$, where $\tau'$ is the topology induced by $d'$.
The space $[0, 1]^{\mathbb{N}}$ with the product topology is metrizable and separable.
The topology $\tau'$ is the initial topology induced by the family $\{f_n\}$.
Since each $f_n$ is continuous with respect to $\tau$, $\tau' \subseteq \tau$.
We need to show that $\tau'$ is separable.

The space $[0, 1]^{\mathbb{N}}$ is separable. A countable dense set is the set of sequences with finitely many non-zero rational coordinates.
Let $Y$ be the closure of $e(X)$ in $[0, 1]^{\mathbb{N}}$. Then $Y$ is metrizable and separable.
The map $e: (X, \tau') \to e(X)$ is a homeomorphism.
If $e(X)$ is separable in the product topology, then $\tau'$ is separable.

Let $d$ be a metric for $\tau$.
Consider a countable base $\mathcal{B}$ for the metric space $(X, d)$.
Let $A \subseteq X$ be a countable dense subset with respect to $\tau$.

Let $d$ be a metric on $X$ inducing $\tau$.

Consider the topology $\tau_Y$ on $X$ generated by the subbase $\{B_d(y, r) : y \in Y, r \in \mathbb{Q}^+\}$.
$\tau_Y$ is separable and metrizable.
However, $\tau_Y$ may not be coarser than $\tau$.

Let $d$ be a metric for $\tau$.
Consider the set of all continuous functions from $(X, \tau)$ to $\mathbb{R}$.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of continuous functions from $(X, \tau)$ to $[0, 1]$ that separates points.
Since $(X, \tau)$ is metrizable, there exists a countable such family $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.
Let $\tau'$ be the initial topology on $X$ induced by $\{f_n\}$.
$\tau'$ is the coarsest topology on $X$ such that each $f_n$ is continuous.
Since each $f_n$ is $\tau$-continuous, $\tau' \subseteq \tau$.
The topology $\tau'$ is the topology induced by the metric $d'(x, y) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} |f_n(x) - f_n(y)|$.
We need to show that $\tau'$ is separable.

Consider the evaluation map $e: X \to \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ given by $e(x) = (f_n(x))_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.
The topology $\tau'$ is the pullback of the product topology on $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ under $e$.
The product topology on $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ is metrizable and separable.
The metric is $D(a, b) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} \min(1, |a_n - b_n|)$.
The map $e: (X, \tau') \to (e(X), d')$ is a homeomorphism, where $d'$ is the restriction of $D$ to $e(X)$.
Since $(e(X), d')$ is a subspace of a separable metric space, it is separable.
Therefore, $(X, \tau')$ is separable.

Summary of the argument:
1. Since $\tau$ is metrizable, there exists a countable family of continuous functions $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ from $(X, \tau)$ to $[0, 1]$ that separates points.
2. Define a new topology $\tau'$ on $X$ as the initial topology induced by the family $\{f_n\}$. This is the coarsest topology such that each $f_n$ is continuous.
3. Since each $f_n$ is continuous with respect to $\tau$, it follows that $\tau' \subseteq \tau$.
4. The topology $\tau'$ is induced by the metric $d'(x, y) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} |f_n(x) - f_n(y)|$, so $\tau'$ is metrizable.
5. Consider the evaluation map $e: X \to [0, 1]^{\mathbb{N}}$ defined by $e(x) = (f_n(x))_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$. This map is an embedding of $(X, \tau')$ into the Hilbert cube $[0, 1]^{\mathbb{N}}$.
6. The Hilbert cube $[0, 1]^{\mathbb{N}}$ is metrizable and separable.
7. Since $e$ is an embedding, $(X, \tau')$ is homeomorphic to the subspace $e(X)$ of the Hilbert cube.
8. A subspace of a separable metric space is separable. Therefore, $(X, \tau')$ is separable.

Need to ensure the existence of a countable family of continuous functions that separates points.
Theorem: A topological space $X$ is metrizable if and only if it is regular and has a $\sigma$-locally finite base.
Theorem: For a metrizable space, there exists a countable family of continuous functions to $[0, 1]$ that separates points.
Proof: Let $d$ be a metric for $X$. For each pair of distinct points $x, y \in X$, let $r_{x, y} = d(x, y) / 3$. Consider the open balls $B(x, r_{x, y})$ and $B(y, r_{x, y})$. These are disjoint. By Urysohn's Lemma, there exists a continuous function $f_{x, y}: X \to [0, 1]$ such that $f_{x, y}(B(x, r_{x, y})) = \{0\}$ and $f_{x, y}(B(y, r_{x, y})) = \{1\}$. The collection of such functions is uncountable in general.

Alternative approach for finding a countable separating family:
Since $X$ is metrizable, it has a $\sigma$-locally finite base $\mathcal{B} = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal{B}_n$, where each $\mathcal{B}_n$ is locally finite.
For any two disjoint closed sets $A, B$, there exists a continuous function $f: X \to [0, 1]$ such that $f(A) = \{0\}$ and $f(B) = \{1\}$.
Consider pairs of disjoint basic open sets from a countable base.

Let $d$ be a metric for $\tau$.
For each $x \in X$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, consider the open ball $B_d(x, 1/n)$.
The set of continuous functions is large.

Consider a countable base $\mathcal{B} = \{U_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ for $\tau$.
For each pair $(U_i, U_j)$ such that $\overline{U_i} \subseteq U_j$, by Urysohn's Lemma, there exists a continuous function $f_{i, j}: X \to [0, 1]$ such that $f_{i, j}(\overline{U_i}) = \{0\}$ and $f_{i, j}(X \setminus U_j) = \{1\}$.
The family of such functions $\{f_{i, j}\}$ is countable.
This family separates points and closed sets. If $x \in O$ (open), there exists $U_j$ such that $x \in U_j \subseteq O$. By regularity, there exists $U_i$ such that $x \in U_i$ and $\overline{U_i} \subseteq U_j$. Then $f_{i, j}(x) = 0$ and $f_{i, j}(X \setminus O) = 1$.

Let $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a countable family of bounded continuous functions from $(X, \tau)$ to $\mathbb{R}$ that separates points.
Define $\tau'$ as the topology induced by the metric $d'(x, y) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} \frac{|f_n(x) - f_n(y)|}{1 + |f_n(x) - f_n(y)|}$.
Or, if the range is $[0, 1]$, $d'(x, y) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} |f_n(x) - f_n(y)|$.

The cardinality condition $|X| \leq c$ might be relevant for other constructions, but for the existence of a countable separating family of continuous functions on a metrizable space, it is not needed.

Final check of the argument:
1. Start with a metrizable topology $\tau$ on $X$.
2. Since $(X, \tau)$ is metrizable, there exists a countable family of continuous functions $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ from $(X, \tau)$ to $[0, 1]$ that separates points.
3. Define a new topology $\tau'$ on $X$ as the initial topology induced by $\{f_n\}$. This means the subbase for $\tau'$ is the collection of sets $f_n^{-1}(V)$, where $V$ is open in $[0, 1]$.
4. The topology $\tau'$ is metrizable, induced by the metric $d'(x, y) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} |f_n(x) - f_n(y)|$.
5. Since each $f_n$ is continuous with respect to $\tau$, the topology $\tau'$ is coarser than $\tau$.
6. The space $(X, \tau')$ is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Hilbert cube $[0, 1]^{\mathbb{N}}$ via the embedding $e(x) = (f_n(x))_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.
7. The Hilbert cube is separable and metrizable.
8. A subspace of a separable metric space is separable. Therefore, $(X, \tau')$ is separable.

The condition on the cardinality of $X$ might be relevant if one tries to construct a separable metric directly. For example, if $|X| \leq c$, then there exists a bijection from $X$ to a subset of $\mathbb{R}$.
