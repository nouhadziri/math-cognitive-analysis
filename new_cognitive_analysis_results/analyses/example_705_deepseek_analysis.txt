Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to find the product of the cosecant squared of all the odd degree angles from 1° up to 89°, because 2k-1 when k=45 gives 89°, right? The question says that this product equals m^n where m and n are integers greater than 1, and we need to find m + n. 

First, let me write down what the product actually is. The product is from k=1 to k=45 of csc^2((2k-1)°). Since cosecant is the reciprocal of sine, this product can be written as the product from k=1 to 45 of [1 / sin^2((2k-1)°)]. So, the entire product becomes 1 divided by the product of all those sine squares. 

Hmm, so maybe if I can find the product of the sines, then square it and take the reciprocal? That would make sense. So first I need to compute P = product of sin((2k-1)°) from k=1 to 45, then the original product is 1/P^2, which equals m^n. 

But how do I compute the product of these sine terms? I remember there are some product formulas for sines of angles in arithmetic progression, or maybe some identities related to roots of unity? Let me think. 

Another approach: maybe use complex numbers? Euler's formula relates sine to complex exponentials. But that might get too complicated with products. Alternatively, maybe use the identity that relates the product of sines when angles are evenly spaced. 

Wait, I recall that there is a formula for the product of sines of equally spaced angles on the unit circle. For example, the product of sin(kπ/(2n)) for k=1 to n-1 is known. But here our angles are in degrees, but converting them to radians, 1° is π/180 radians. Let me check. 

Wait, the angles here are 1°, 3°, 5°,..., 89°, which are all the odd degree angles up to 89°, which is π/2 radians minus 1°, right? Since 90° is π/2. So the angles go up to 89°, which is complementary to 1°, maybe something with complementary angles? But not sure yet. 

Alternatively, recall that sin(θ) = cos(90° - θ), so maybe this product is a product of sine and cosine terms, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe use the formula for the product of sines in a sequence. 

Wait, I vaguely remember that the product of sines of angles that are in arithmetic progression can be expressed using certain formulas, but I’m not 100% sure. Let me look this up mentally. 

Alternatively, I remember that in some problems, especially competition problems, the product of sines over these angles often relates to powers of 2. For instance, product of sin(kπ/(2n)) from 1 to n-1 is something over 2^{n-1} or similar. Wait, here n would be 45? Hmm. 

Wait, let me recall the exact formula. There's a formula that says that the product of sin(kπ/(2n)) for k=1 to n-1 is sqrt(n/2^{2n-2})). Wait, but that might not be exactly right. Wait, actually, in concrete terms, for example, the product of sin(π/(2n)) * sin(2π/(2n)) * ... * sin((n-1)π/(2n)) is sqrt(n)/2^{n-1}. But I need to verify that. Hmm, perhaps not. 

Alternatively, I think it's known that the product of sin(kπ/(2n)) for k=1 to n-1 is  sqrt(n)/2^{n-1}. Let me check with a small n. For example, n=2, then the product sin(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2. sqrt(2)/2^1 = sqrt(2)/2, so yes, matches. For n=3, product sin(π/6) * sin(π/3) = (1/2) * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. According to the formula, sqrt(3)/2^(2) = sqrt(3)/4. That works. For n=4: sin(π/8)*sin(π/4)*sin(3π/8). Let's compute that: sin(π/8)= sqrt(2 - sqrt(2))/2 ≈0.383, sin(π/4)=sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.707, sin(3π/8)=sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))/2 ≈0.924. Multiply them together: approximately 0.383 * 0.707 * 0.924 ≈0.25. The formula says sqrt(4)/2^3=2/8=0.25. That's exact. So indeed, the product is sqrt(n)/2^{n-1}. So, that formula holds. 

So in our case, if the angles are converted to radians, that could correspond to something. Let me think. 

We have angles (2k-1)°, which is in degrees. Let's convert that to radians: (2k-1)° = (2k-1)π/180 radians. So, each term is sin((2k-1)π/180) for k=1 to 45. 

Wait, so the product we need is product_{k=1}^{45} sin((2k-1)π/180). Then, according to the formula, when n=90? Let me see. Wait, the formula is product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/(2n)) = sqrt(n)/2^{n-1}. How does that compare to our problem? 

Wait, in our problem, the angles are (2k-1)π/180, which for k=1 to 45, that is equivalent to (2k-1)π/(180) = (2k-1)π/(2*90). So, if n=90, then (2k-1)π/(2*90). But in the formula, we have product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/(2n)). However, in our case, k is replaced by (2k-1)/2, which aren't integers. So perhaps my initial thought was not directly applicable. 

Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that the angles from 1°, 3°, ..., 89° correspond to kπ/(2*90) for k=1, 3, ..., 89. So, it's all the odd multiples of π/(2*90) up to 89π/(180). Hmm. So let's denote θ = π/180, then the angles are θ, 3θ, 5θ,...,89θ. So, maybe in the formula, if I have n=90, then the angles would be kθ for k=1 to 89, but we're taking only the odd ones here. 

But how do we relate the product of sines of odd multiples of θ? Maybe consider that the product over all k=1 to 89 of sin(kθ) is known, and then our product is the product over odd k, so maybe to relate the total product to the product over odd k, perhaps using some symmetry?

Alternatively, we could write down the product P = product_{k=1}^{45} sin((2k-1)θ) where θ=π/180. Then, note that sin((2k-1)θ) for k=1 to 45 corresponds to sin(θ), sin(3θ), ..., sin(89θ). 

But I recall that the product of sin(kθ) for k=1 to n-1 is 2^{1-n} times n. Wait, no, that was for the roots of unity. Wait, perhaps relate to roots of unity? Since the product of sines can sometimes be expressed in terms of roots of unity. 

Consider that if we take the equation z^n - 1 = 0, its roots are the nth roots of unity. Similarly, maybe the product of sin(kπ/(2n)) can be derived from such. 

Alternatively, perhaps split the product into two parts: even and odd terms? Wait, but given that all our terms are odd, maybe complementary.

Alternatively, think about complex numbers. Let's denote that z = e^{iθ}, then sin(kθ) = (z^k - z^{-k})/(2i). So, the product of sin(kθ) would be product_{k} (z^k - z^{-k})/(2i). But if the angles are 1°, 3°, ..., 89°, then θ=π/180. But perhaps this is getting too involved. Let me see. 

Alternatively, looking at this resource: There's a formula for the product of sines of equally spaced angles, perhaps for the product in question.

Wait, upon Googling in my mind, I recall that the product of sin(kπ/(2n)) for k=1 to n-1 is sqrt(n)/2^{n-1}. But in this case, if n=90, then the product from k=1 to 89 of sin(kπ/(180)) should be sqrt(90)/2^{89}. But our product is over k=1 to 45 of sin((2k-1)π/180), which is the product of sines of all the odd multiples from 1 to 89 degrees. So that's half of the total product from 1 to 89.

Wait, actually, the total product of sin(kπ/180) from k=1 to 89 is equal to sqrt(90)/2^{89}. But how do we relate the product of odd k terms?

Because the product from k=1 to 89 of sin(kπ/180) is (product from k=1 to 44 of sin(kπ/180) * sin((90 - k)π/180)) * sin(45π/180) ). Since 89 terms split into pair k and 90 -k, but when k=45, that is sin(45π/180)=sin(π/4)=sqrt(2)/2. So the product is [product from k=1 to 44 sin(kπ/180)sin((90 -k)π/180)] * sqrt(2)/2. Note that sin(kπ/180)sin((90 -k)π/180), but sin((90 -k)π/180)=cos(kπ/180). Therefore, sin(k)cos(k) = (1/2) sin(2k). So, but that might not be helpful here. Wait, if we take sin(a)sin(90° -a) = sin(a)cos(a) = (1/2) sin(2a). So, in this case, each pair would give (1/2) sin(2a). So the total product becomes ( (1/2)^{44} * product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2kπ/180) ) * sqrt(2)/2.

But then the product is now (1/2^{44}) * product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2kπ/180) * sqrt(2)/2 = (sqrt(2)/2^{45}) ) * product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2kπ/180). But note that 2kπ/180 = kπ/90. So, the product of sin(kπ/90) from k=1 to 44. So then this product is product_{k=1}^{44} sin(kπ/90).

But now, since n=90, product_{k=1}^{44} sin(kπ/90) would be part of the total product from k=1 to 89 of sin(kπ/180). Wait, but maybe use the formula that product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n) = n / 2^{n-1}.

Wait, yes, but the formula is:

The product of sin(kπ/n) from k=1 to n-1 is n / 2^{n-1}. Wait, no. Wait, that cannot be. Because for n=2, product is sin(π/2)=1, and formula would give 2/2^{1}=1, which matches. For n=3: product of sin(π/3) and sin(2π/3). Both are sqrt(3)/2, so their product is 3/4. Formula gives 3 / 2^{2}=3/4, which matches. For n=4: sin(π/4), sin(π/2), sin(3π/4). Their product is (sqrt(2)/2)*1*(sqrt(2)/2) = 1/2. Formula gives 4 / 2^3 = 4/8 = 1/2. Also matches. So, the formula actually is:

product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n) = n / 2^{n-1}

Wait, so in general:

product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n) = n / 2^{n-1}

However, in our case, when n=90, the product from k=1 to 89 of sin(kπ/90) should be 90 / 2^{89}. 

But according to our calculation above, the product from k=1 to 89 of sin(kπ/180) is sqrt(90)/2^{89}, but how? Wait, no. Wait, that contradicts if n=180: product_{k=1}^{179} sin(kπ/180) = 180 / 2^{179}.

But in our original problem, when considering sin(kπ/180), but the angles are 1°, 3°, ..., 89°, which corresponds to k odd. So perhaps there's a relation here.

Wait, this seems too time-consuming, but maybe integrating some of these thoughts:

I know that product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n) = n / 2^{n-1}. So for n=90, that's 90 / 2^{89}, but we also considered that the product from k=1}^{89} sin(k°π/180) is 90 / 2^{89}.

However, in the product of sin(kθ) where θ=π/180 and k=1,3,...,89, which is 45 terms. So perhaps 2^{45} times that product would be 90 / 2^{89}? Wait, maybe not. Let me think step by step.

First, we have the total product of all sin(kπ/180) from k=1 to 89 is 180 / 2^{179} according to the formula? Wait, no. Wait, if we plug into the formula, where product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n) = n / 2^{n-1}.

In our case, n=180, so product_{k=1}^{179} sin(kπ/180} = 180 / 2^{179}. But our question is about the product of sin(kπ/180) for k=1,3,...,179, but not exactly. Wait, no. Wait, if we take k from 1° to 89°, which is 1π/180 to 89π/180. If n=180, then n-1=179. So sin(kπ/180) from k=1 to 179, total product 180 / 2^{179}. 

But our problem has to do with the product of sin(kπ/180) for k=1,3,...,89. That is 45 terms. So maybe I can relate this to the total product by factoring the total product into even and odd terms?

So perhaps, the product from k=1 to 179 of sin(kπ/180) equals [product from k=1 to 89 sin(kπ/180) sin((180 - k)π/180)].

But sin((180 -k)π/180) = sin(π - kπ/180) = sin(kπ/180). Therefore, product from k=1 to 89 sin(kπ/180)^2 = 180 / 2^{179} Therefore, product from k=1 to 89 sin(kπ/180) = sqrt(180)/2^{89.5}. Wait, sqrt(180) is 6*sqrt(5), approximately, but in fraction form? Wait, but let's write 180 as 36*5, so sqrt(180)=6*sqrt(5). So product from k=1 to 89 sin(kπ/180) = 6√5 / 2^{89.5} = 6√5 / (2^{89} * sqrt(2)) ) = (6√5 / sqrt(2)) ) / 2^{89} = (3√10) / 2^{89}. 

But maybe not, let's actually check. 

Wait, product_{k=1}^{179} sin(kπ/180) = 180 / 2^{179}.

But product_{k=1}^{179} sin(kπ/180) = product_{k=1}^{89} [sin(kπ/180) * sin((180 - k)π/180)}.

As sin(180 - x) = sin x, so each pair can be written as sin(kπ/180)^2. So the total product is product_{k=1}^{89} sin(kπ/180)^2 = 180 / 2^{179}. Therefore, the product of sin(kπ/180) from k=1 to 89 is sqrt(180 / 2^{179}) )= sqrt(180)/sqrt(2^{179}) = sqrt(180)/2^{89.5} =  sqrt(180)/ (2^{89} * sqrt(2)) ) = sqrt(90)/2^{89}.

Wait, sqrt(180)/sqrt(2) is sqrt(90). Because sqrt(a/b) = sqrt(a)/sqrt(b), so sqrt(180 / 2) = sqrt(90). So this becomes sqrt(90)/2^{89}.

Thus, the product of sin(k°) from k=1 to 89 is sqrt(90)/2^{89}.

But our problem concerns sin(1°)sin(3° )... sin(89°). So in this product, that is the product of sin(k°) where k is odd from 1 to 89.

But how to relate this to the total product of sin(k°) from k=1 to 89. Note that if we consider the even ks from 2° to 88°, but that's two different products. However, perhaps the product over all sin(k°) where k=1 to 89 can be written as [product over odds][product over evens]. However, product over evens:

sins of 2°,4°,...,88°. But notice that sin(2°)=2 sin1° cos1°, wait, but don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps express sin(2k°) as 2 sin(k°) cos(k°) and find a recurrence?

If the total product is P = product_{k=1}^{89} sin(k°) = [product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2k-1)°] * [product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2k°)} * sin(45°)

Because 89 terms: from 1° to 89°, the odd ones are 1°,3°, ...,89°, that's 45 terms (since (89 -1)/2 +1=45). Wait, actually 45 terms: from 1° to 89°, stepping by 2, that is (89-1)/2 +1= 45. Then the evens are 2°,4°,...,88°, which is 44 terms, and then the middle term is 45°, but 45° is odd because 45=2*23 -1, no: 45 is odd, yes, but 22.5 would be non-integer. Wait, no. The even ks are 2°,4°,...,88°, 44 terms. Then sin(45°) is separate? Wait, no. 89 is 45 odd terms (1° to 89°, step 2°), evens 2° to 88°, step 2°, that's 44 terms, but they don't include 45°. So total products:

Product_{odds} = product_{k=1}^{45} sin((2k-1)°)
Product_{evens} = product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2k°)
Hence:

P = Product_{odds} * Product_{evens} * sin(90°). Wait, but we have to 89°, so not exactly. Wait:

Wait, hold on. 1° to 89° in steps of 1°: 89 terms.

Separating into odds and evens:

Odds: 1°,3°,5°,...,89° (45 terms)

Evens: 2°,4°,6°,...,88° (44 terms)

So the total product is Product_{odds} * Product_{evens}

Therefore:

Product_{odds} * Product_{evens} = P = sqrt(90)/2^{89}

So, Product_{odds} * Product_{evens} = sqrt(90)/2^{89}

Also, for the Product_{evens}, let me think. Since these are angles doubled. That is 2°,4°,6°,...,88°, which is 44 terms.

Note that sin(2k°) = sin(2 * k°) for k=1,...,44.

But perhaps we can relate Product_{evens} to Product sin(k°) for k=1,...,44. Let me consider substitution. Let me set θ = 2°, then you can write Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2k°) = Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2 * k° )

But sin(2k°) = 2 sin(k°) cos(k°). So, Product_{evens} = Product_{k=1}^{44} 2 sin(k°) cos(k°) = 2^{44} Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k°) Product_{k=1}^{44} cos(k° )

Therefore, Product_{evens} = 2^{44} Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k°) Product_{k=1}^{44} cos(k° )

But note that Product_{evens} = 2^{44} [Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k°)] [Product_{k=1}^{44} cos(k°) ]

Therefore, going back, total product:

Product_{odds} * Product_{evens} = Product_{odds} * 2^{44} [Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k°)] [Product_{k=1}^{44} cos(k°)] = sqrt(90)/2^{89}

But let's see. Wait, Note that Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k°) is part of Product_{k=1}^{89} sin(k°). But we need to relate these. Wait, Product_{odds} = product_{k=1}^{45} sin((2k-1)°). And Product_{evens} = product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2k°) = 2^{44} product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k°) cos(k° )

Therefore:

Product_{odds} * Product_{evens} = Product_{odds} * 2^{44} product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k°) cos(k° ) = sqrt(90)/2^{89}

But note that in the product odds and evens, also:

Product_{odds} = P_odds = product_{k=1}^{45} sin((2k -1)° )

And Product_evens = product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2k° )

But  note that the total product P = P_odds * P_evens.

So using this substitution:

But to make progress, perhaps express everything in terms of Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k°) cos(k° )

Alternatively, note that the combined products have terms that overlap.

Alternatively, to express in terms of another variable. Let me think.

Another approach, if I let Q = Product_{k=1}^{45} sin((2k -1)° )

Then, according to the formula above:

Q * P_evens = sqrt(90)/2^{89}

But we need to express Q, and P_evens in terms of known formulas.

But P_evens = 2^{44} Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k°) cos(k° )

But maybe express this in terms of Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2k°). Hmm, which that already is. Wait,  not helpful. Wait, the other way. sin(2k°) = 2 sin(k°) cos(k°) , so product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2k° ) = 2^{44} product sin(k°) cos(k° )

But P_evens = product of sin(2k° ) for k=1 to44 =2^{44} product sin(k°) cos(k° )

Therefore:

Product sin(k° ) from k=1 to44 times Product cos(k° ) from k=1 to44 = ?

Let’s look at these two products:

Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k° ), and Product_{k=1}^{44} cos(k° )

Not sure how to directly compute that. But maybe using multiple angle identities?

Wait, there's a formula for product cos(k° ). For example, product_{k=1}^{n} cos( (kπ)/(2n+1) ) ) = 1 / 2^n, but that's in radians and with specific angles. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps if I pair sin(k°) cos(k° ) = (1/2) sin(2k° )

Therefore, Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k° ) cos(k° ) = (1/2^{44}) Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2k° )

But then we have:

Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k° ) cos(k° ) = (1 / 2^{44}) Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2k° )

But that product sin(2k° ) for k=1 to 44 is the same as P_evens except the last term. Wait, because sin(2k° ) for k=1 to 44 is 2°,4°,...,88°, which is 44 terms. Wait, yes. Therefore, Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2k° ) = P_evens. So we have:

Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k° ) cos(k° ) = (1 / 2^{44}) P_evens

But then the equation we had before becomes:

Q * P_evens = sqrt(90) / 2^{89}

But Q is the product_{k=1}^{45} sin((2k -1)° )

But also recall that P_evens = product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2k° ) = product Evens

Now, using the substitution:

Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k° ) cos(k° ) = (1 /2^{44}) P_evens. Then, substituting into P_evens' expression:

Wait, perhaps not helpful. Let me try going back.

We have:

Q * P_evens = sqrt(90)/2^{89}

But from above. Where Q = Product_{k=1}^{45} sin((2k -1)° )

Therefore if we can express P_evens in terms of Q or something else.

Alternatively, there is a relationship between the evens and odds. 

Wait, consider that sin(k°) * sin(60° -k° ) * sin(60° +k° ) = (1/4) sin(3k° ). But maybe that's specific for 3k. Not sure. 

Alternatively, recall that for sine product identities, perhaps if we use multiple-angle identities. For n angles creating a product, but this seems too vague.

Wait, another idea: Using complex logarithms. Take log of the product. But calculus may be involved. Maybe not.

Alternatively, writing all in terms of radians. But then integrating or differentiating.

Alternatively, maybe relate this to the formula we found before: product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n ) = n / 2^{n - 1}

But if we take n = 180, so sin(kπ/180 ) for k=1,2,...179. The product for all terms. We already have that. So how is that related to our problem.

Wait, our problem is the product Q = product_{k=1}^{45} sin((2k -1 )π/180 )

Similarly, formula gives product_{k=1}^{179} sin(kπ/180 ) = 180 / 2^{179}

But we can relate this total product to our partial products (as we tried earlier), splitting into odd and even.

So as before, product_{ odds } * product_{ evens } = 180 / 2^{179}

But if we can write the product_{ evens } in terms of product_{ lower angles }. Let me see:

Product_{ evens } = product_{k=1}^{89} sin(2kπ/180 ) = product_{k=1}^{89} sin(kπ/90 )

But n=90 here. Then, by the same formula, product_{k=1}^{89} sin(kπ/90 ) = 90 / 2^{89}

Therefore product_{k=1}^{89} sin(kπ/90 ) = 90 / 2^{89}

But wait, sin(kπ/90 ) where k=1 to89 is equivalent to our product_{ evens } when converting degrees: yes, because 2° in radians is 2π/180=π/90. So 2°,4°,...,88° is 1π/90, 2π/90, ...,44π/90, but wait, no.

Wait, actually K in product_{ evens } ranges from 2°,4°,...,88°, which is 44 terms. But translating that to radians, each term is 2k°, which is 2kπ/180 = kπ/90 radians, where k=1 to44. So product_{k=1}^{44} sin(kπ/90 )

But the formula for product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n ) = n / 2^{n-1}.

So for n=90, product_{k=1}^{89} sin(kπ/90 ) = 90 / 2^{89}

But that's from k=1 to89, but our product_{ evens } is k=1 to44, since 2k° = kπ/90 for k=1 to44, so:

Product_{ evens } = product_{k=1}^{44} sin(kπ /90 )

But how to relate this to the full product of k=1 to89.

Let me see: product_{k=1}^{89} sin(kπ /90 ) = [product_{k=1}^{44} sin(kπ/90 )] * sin(45π/90 ) * [product_{k=46}^{89} sin(kπ/90 )]

But sin(45π/90 )= sin(π/2)=1. Then, note that for k from46 to89, sin(kπ/90 )=sin((90 - (k -45))π/90 )=sin((90 -k +45)π/90 )?

Wait, let me compute. When k =46: sin(46π/90 )= sin( (90π -44π)/90 )=sin(π - 44π/90 )=sin(44π/90 ). Similarly, k=47→ sin(43π/90 ), and so on, k=89→sin(1π/90 ). Thus, product_{k=46}^{89} sin(kπ/90)= product_{k=1}^{44} sin(kπ/90 ). Hence the total product is:

product_{k=1}^{89} sin(kπ/90) = [product_{k=1}^{44} sin(kπ/90 )]^2 * sin(45π/90 ).

sin(45π/90)=sin(π/2)=1 so it equals product_{k=1}^{44}^2. But the total product is 90 / 2^{89} = [product_{k=1}^{44} sin(kπ/90 )]^2

Therefore, product_{k=1}^{44} sin(kπ/90 ) = sqrt(90)/2^{89/2}

Wait, sqrt(90)/2^{44.5} would that be squared?

Wait, according to formula, product_{k=1}^{89} sin(kπ/90 )= 90/2^{89}.

But as above, = [product_{first44} * product_{second44} * sin(middle)} = [product_{first44}]^2*1.

So [product_{first 44}]^2 =90 /2^{89}

Hence product_{first44} =sqrt(90)/2^{44.5} =sqrt(90)/(2^{44} sqrt(2) )

Which is sqrt(90/2)/2^{44} =sqrt(45)/2^{44} = (3*sqrt(5))/2^{44}

But product_{evens} = product_{k=1}^{44} sin(kπ/90 ) = sqrt(45)/2^{44}

So product_{evens} = 3*sqrt(5)/2^{44}

Wait, sqrt(45)=3*sqrt(5), yes.

Therefore, going back:

Product_{odds} * Product_{evens} = sqrt(90)/2^{89}

But Product_{evens}=3√5 /2^{44}. Then,

Product_{odds} * (3√5 /2^{44}) = sqrt(90)/2^{89}

Multiply both sides by2^{44}:

Product_{odds} * 3√5 = sqrt(90)/2^{45}

Thus, Product_{odds}= sqrt(90)/( 3√5 *2^{45} )

Simplify sqrt(90): sqrt(9*10)=3 sqrt(10). So numerator:3 sqrt(10), denominator:3 sqrt(5)*2^45 ) √(10)/√(5) is sqrt2, so sqrt(10)/sqrt(5)=sqrt(2). Therefore:

Product_{odds} = sqrt(2)/ 2^{45} = 1/2^{44.5}=1/(2^{44} sqrt(2))

But then we need Q= product_{k=1}^{45} sin((2k -1)° ) = Product_odds. Thus,

Q= sqrt(2)/ (2^{45})

Therefore, original product is 1/Q^2= 1/( (sqrt(2)/2^{45})^2 )=1/(2 /2^{90})=2^{90}/2=2^{89}

Wait, wait. Let's double-check that step:

If Q = product_{k=1}^{45} sin((2k -1)° ), then original problem is Product_{k=1}^{45} csc^2((2k -1)° ) = 1/Q^2.

We found Q = sqrt(2)/2^{45}, therefore Q^2= 2 / 2^{90}=1 /2^{89}, right? sqrt(2)^2=2 and (2^{45})^2 =2^{90}, so Q squared is 2 /2^{90} =1 /2^{89}

Therefore. 1/Q^2=2^{89}

Thus, m^n =2^{89}, So m=2, n=89. Therefore, m +n=91.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{91}

# Analysis of Cognitive Skills in Mathematical Problem-Solving

<skill>Strategic Knowledge Application</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and apply relevant mathematical formulas, theorems, or identities that are appropriate for solving a specific problem.</definition>

<start>1018</start>
<end>1304</end>
<text>Alternatively, I remember that in some problems, especially competition problems, the product of sines of angles that are in arithmetic progression can be expressed using certain formulas, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me look this up mentally.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates strategic knowledge application by recognizing that this problem likely has a standard approach involving formulas for products of sines in arithmetic progression, which is common in competition mathematics. They're drawing on their knowledge of typical solution patterns for this class of problems.</explanation>

<start>1492</start>
<end>1917</end>
<text>Alternatively, I think it's known that the product of sin(kπ/(2n)) for k=1 to n-1 is  sqrt(n)/2^{n-1}. Let me check with a small n. For example, n=2, then the product sin(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2. sqrt(2)/2^1 = sqrt(2)/2, so yes, matches. For n=3, product sin(π/6) * sin(π/3) = (1/2) * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. According to the formula, sqrt(3)/2^(2) = sqrt(3)/4. That works.</text>
<explanation>The solver recalls a specific formula for products of sines and systematically tests it with small values of n to verify its correctness. This demonstrates the application of domain-specific knowledge and the methodical verification of that knowledge before applying it to the problem at hand.</explanation>

<start>7551</start>
<end>7761</end>
<text>But I recall that the product of sin(kπ/n) from k=1 to n-1 is n / 2^{n-1}. Wait, no. Wait, that cannot be. Because for n=2, product is sin(π/2)=1, and formula would give 2/2^{1}=1, which matches.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies a formula for products of sines and immediately tests it with a simple case to verify its correctness, showing strategic knowledge application by ensuring the formula is valid before proceeding with the solution.</explanation>

<skill>Verification and Testing</skill>
<definition>The process of checking the validity of mathematical claims, formulas, or intermediate results by testing them with specific examples or edge cases.</definition>

<start>1917</start>
<end>2377</end>
<text>For n=4: sin(π/8)*sin(π/4)*sin(3π/8). Let's compute that: sin(π/8)= sqrt(2 - sqrt(2))/2 ≈0.383, sin(π/4)=sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.707, sin(3π/8)=sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))/2 ≈0.924. Multiply them together: approximately 0.383 * 0.707 * 0.924 ≈0.25. The formula says sqrt(4)/2^3=2/8=0.25. That's exact. So indeed, the product is sqrt(n)/2^{n-1}. So, that formula holds.</text>
<explanation>The solver meticulously verifies a formula by testing it with n=4, calculating each sine value precisely, multiplying them together, and comparing the result with what the formula predicts. This careful verification demonstrates a commitment to ensuring mathematical correctness.</explanation>

<start>7761</start>
<end>8192</end>
<text>For n=3: product of sin(π/3) and sin(2π/3). Both are sqrt(3)/2, so their product is 3/4. Formula gives 3 / 2^{2}=3/4, which matches. For n=4: sin(π/4), sin(π/2), sin(3π/4). Their product is (sqrt(2)/2)*1*(sqrt(2)/2) = 1/2. Formula gives 4 / 2^3 = 4/8 = 1/2. Also matches. So, the formula actually is:

product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n) = n / 2^{n-1}</text>
<explanation>The solver systematically tests the formula with n=3 and n=4, calculating the exact values and verifying that they match the formula's prediction. This methodical verification builds confidence in the formula before applying it to the actual problem.</explanation>

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify mathematical patterns, structures, or relationships that can simplify complex problems or reveal solution paths.</definition>

<start>9881</start>
<end>10322</end>
<text>So perhaps, the product from k=1 to 179 of sin(kπ/180) equals [product from k=1 to 89 sin(kπ/180) sin((180 - k)π/180)].

But sin((180 -k)π/180) = sin(π - kπ/180) = sin(kπ/180). Therefore, product from k=1 to 89 sin(kπ/180)^2 = 180 / 2^{179} Therefore, product from k=1 to 89 sin(kπ/180) = sqrt(180)/2^{89.5}.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes a pattern in the sine values, specifically that sin(π-x) = sin(x), which allows them to rewrite the product of 179 terms as the product of 89 squared terms. This pattern recognition significantly simplifies the calculation.</explanation>

<start>14007</start>
<end>14559</end>
<text>Let me see: product_{k=1}^{89} sin(kπ /90 ) = [product_{k=1}^{44} sin(kπ/90 )] * sin(45π/90 ) * [product_{k=46}^{89} sin(kπ/90 )]

But sin(45π/90 )= sin(π/2)=1. Then, note that for k from46 to89, sin(kπ/90 )=sin((90 - (k -45))π/90 )=sin((90 -k +45)π/90 )?

Wait, let me compute. When k =46: sin(46π/90 )= sin( (90π -44π)/90 )=sin(π - 44π/90 )=sin(44π/90 ). Similarly, k=47→ sin(43π/90 ), and so on, k=89→sin(1π/90 ). Thus, product_{k=46}^{89} sin(kπ/90)= product_{k=1}^{44} sin(kπ/90 ).</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies a symmetry pattern in sine values, recognizing that sin(π-x) = sin(x), which allows them to relate the product of terms from k=46 to 89 to the product of terms from k=1 to 44. This pattern recognition enables a significant simplification of the calculation.</explanation>

<skill>Problem Decomposition</skill>
<definition>The ability to break down a complex mathematical problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems that can be solved independently.</definition>

<start>11886</start>
<end>12220</end>
<text>If the total product is P = product_{k=1}^{89} sin(k°) = [product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2k-1)°] * [product_{k=1}^{44} sin(2k°)} * sin(45°)

Because 89 terms: from 1° to 89°, the odd ones are 1°,3°, ...,89°, that's 45 terms (since (89 -1)/2 +1=45).</text>
<explanation>The solver decomposes the product of all angles from 1° to 89° into separate products of odd-degree angles and even-degree angles. This decomposition makes the problem more tractable by allowing the solver to work with these sub-products separately.</explanation>

<start>12565</start>
<end>12881</end>
<text>Wait, hold on. 1° to 89° in steps of 1°: 89 terms.

Separating into odds and evens:

Odds: 1°,3°,5°,...,89° (45 terms)

Evens: 2°,4°,6°,...,88° (44 terms)

So the total product is Product_{odds} * Product_{evens}

Therefore:

Product_{odds} * Product_{evens} = P = sqrt(90)/2^{89}</text>
<explanation>The solver clearly breaks down the original product into two separate products - one for odd angles and one for even angles. This decomposition creates a structure that allows for applying different formulas to each sub-product, ultimately leading to the solution.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to transform mathematical expressions through valid operations to simplify them or reveal important relationships.</definition>

<start>13030</start>
<end>13344</end>
<text>But sin(2k°) = 2 sin(k°) cos(k°). So, Product_{evens} = Product_{k=1}^{44} 2 sin(k°) cos(k°) = 2^{44} Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k°) Product_{k=1}^{44} cos(k° )

Therefore, Product_{evens} = 2^{44} Product_{k=1}^{44} sin(k°) Product_{k=1}^{44} cos(k° )</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the double angle formula for sine and then distributes the product across the terms, factoring out the constant 2^44. This algebraic manipulation transforms the product of even-degree sines into a more manageable form.</explanation>

<start>15407</start>
<end>15931</end>
<text>Product_{odds} * Product_{evens} = sqrt(90)/2^{89}

But Product_{evens}=3√5 /2^{44}. Then,

Product_{odds} * (3√5 /2^{44}) = sqrt(90)/2^{89}

Multiply both sides by2^{44}:

Product_{odds} * 3√5 = sqrt(90)/2^{45}

Thus, Product_{odds}= sqrt(90)/( 3√5 *2^{45} )

Simplify sqrt(90): sqrt(9*10)=3 sqrt(10). So numerator:3 sqrt(10), denominator:3 sqrt(5)*2^45 ) √(10)/√(5) is sqrt2, so sqrt(10)/sqrt(5)=sqrt(2). Therefore:

Product_{odds} = sqrt(2)/ 2^{45} = 1/2^{44.5}=1/(2^{44} sqrt(2))</text>
<explanation>The solver performs a series of algebraic manipulations to solve for Product_{odds}, including multiplying both sides by 2^44, simplifying square roots, and rationalizing expressions. These manipulations transform complex expressions into more manageable forms.</explanation>

<skill>Metacognitive Monitoring</skill>
<definition>The ability to reflect on one's own thinking process, evaluate the effectiveness of current strategies, recognize errors, and adjust approaches accordingly.</definition>

<start>3008</start>
<end>3243</end>
<text>Wait, so the product we need is product_{k=1}^{45} sin((2k-1)π/180). Then, according to the formula, when n=90? Let me see. Wait, the formula is product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/(2n)) = sqrt(n)/2^{n-1}. How does that compare to our problem?</text>
<explanation>The solver pauses to reconsider whether the formula they're using actually applies to the problem. They explicitly compare the formula structure with the problem structure, showing awareness of their own reasoning process and a willingness to check their approach.</explanation>

<start>8348</start>
<end>8549</end>
<text>But in our original problem, when considering sin(kπ/180), but the angles are 1°, 3°, ..., 89°, which corresponds to k odd. So perhaps there's a relation here.

Wait, this seems too time-consuming, but maybe integrating some of these thoughts:</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that their current approach might be inefficient and decides to refocus their strategy. This demonstrates awareness of their problem-solving process and the ability to adjust their approach when needed.</explanation>

<start>16329</start>
<end>16694</end>
<text>If Q = product_{k=1}^{45} sin((2k -1)° ), then original problem is Product_{k=1}^{45} csc^2((2k -1)° ) = 1/Q^2.

We found Q = sqrt(2)/2^{45}, therefore Q^2= 2 / 2^{90}=1 /2^{89}, right? sqrt(2)^2=2 and (2^{45})^2 =2^{90}, so Q squared is 2 /2^{90} =1 /2^{89}

Therefore. 1/Q^2=2^{89}</text>
<explanation>The solver carefully checks their calculation of Q^2, making sure that the squaring operation is performed correctly. This demonstrates monitoring of their own computational process to avoid errors.</explanation>
