Problem:
Let $S_{7}$ denote all the permutations of $1,2, \ldots, 7$. For any \pi \in S_{7}$, let $f(\pi)$ be the smallest positive integer $i$ such that \pi(1), \pi(2), \ldots, \pi(i)$ is a permutation of $1,2, \ldots, i$. Compute \sum_{\pi \in S_{7}} f(\pi)$.

Domain: Combinatorics

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Extend the definition of $f$ to apply for any permutation of $1,2, \ldots, n$, for any positive integer $n$. For positive integer $n$, let $g(n)$ denote the number of permutations \pi$ of $1,2, \ldots, n$ such that $f(\pi)=n$. We have $g(1)=1$. For fixed $n, k$ (with $k \leq n$ ), the number of permutations \pi$ of $1,2, \ldots, n$ such that $f(\pi)=k$ is $g(k)(n-k)$ !. This gives us the recursive formula $g(n)=$ $n!-\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} g(k)(n-k)$ !. Using this formula, we find that the first 7 values of $g$ are $1,1,3,13,71,461,3447$. Our sum is then equal to \sum_{k=1}^{7} k \cdot g(k)(7-k)$ !. Using our computed values of $g$, we get that the sum evaluates to 29093 .
