Problem:
Compute the nearest integer to $$100 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 3^{n} \sin ^{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right)$$

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I've got this problem here: compute the nearest integer to \(100 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 3^{n} \sin ^{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right)\). Alright, let's break this down step by step. 

First, I need to find the sum of this infinite series and then multiply it by 100 and round it to the nearest integer. The series is \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 3^{n} \sin ^{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n}}\right)\). Hmm, okay. The general term here is \(3^n \sin^3(\pi/3^n)\). 

My first thought is that maybe there's a way to simplify \(\sin^3(x)\). I remember that trigonometric identities can sometimes help reduce powers of sine or cosine. Let me recall: there's an identity for \(\sin^3(x)\), right? Let me check. Oh yeah, the formula is:

\[
\sin^3(x) = \frac{3 \sin(x) - \sin(3x)}{4}
\]

Yes, that's right. So, applying this identity to \(\sin^3\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right)\), the term becomes:

\[
\frac{3 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right) - \sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{3^n}\right)}{4} = \frac{3 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right) - \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}\right)}{4}
\]

So substituting back into the original series, each term \(3^n \sin^3\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right)\) becomes:

\[
3^n \cdot \frac{3 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right) - \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}\right)}{4} = \frac{3^{n+1} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^n}\right) - 3^n \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{n-1}}\right)}{4}
\]

Wow, okay, so that turns each term into a telescoping difference. If that's the case, then the entire sum might collapse nicely. Let's verify this.

If I write the sum out term by term, starting from n=1 to infinity:

For n=1:

\[
\frac{3^{2} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^1}\right) - 3^1 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{0}}\right)}{4} = \frac{9 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) - 3 \sin(\pi)}{4}
\]

For n=2:

\[
\frac{3^{3} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^2}\right) - 3^2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{1}}\right)}{4} = \frac{27 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{9}\right) - 9 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)}{4}
\]

For n=3:

\[
\frac{3^{4} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^3}\right) - 3^3 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{2}}\right)}{4} = \frac{81 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{27}\right) - 27 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{9}\right)}{4}
\]

And so on. So when we sum all these terms, let's see what cancels:

The second term of n=1 is \(-3 \sin(\pi)/4\), but \(\sin(\pi)=0\), so that term is 0.

The first term of n=1 is \(9 \sin(\pi/3)/4\).

Then, for n=2: first term is \(27 \sin(\pi/9)/4\), second term is \(-9 \sin(\pi/3)/4\), which cancels with part of the previous term.

Similarly, for n=3: \(81 \sin(\pi/27)/4 - 27 \sin(\pi/9)/4\), the second term cancels with part of the previous... Wait, actually, the negative terms from each n will cancel with the positive terms of the next n.

Wait, let's actually add up the first few terms to check.

Let me denote S = sum_{n=1}^\infty [ (3^{n+1} sin(pi/3^n) - 3^n sin(pi/3^{n-1})) / 4 ]

Then, writing S:

= (1/4) [ (3^{2} sin(pi/3^1) - 3^{1} sin(pi/3^{0})) + (3^{3} sin(pi/3^2) - 3^{2} sin(pi/3^1)) + (3^{4} sin(pi/3^3) - 3^{3} sin(pi/3^2)) + ... ]

Yes, now when we add all the terms up, we see that most terms cancel:

The -3^{1} sin(pi/3^0) term is from n=1: -3 sin(pi) = 0.

Then for n=1: 9 sin(pi/3) and n=2 cancels -9 sin(pi/3).

Similarly, 27 sin(pi/9) from n=2 is canceled by the n=3 term, which is -27 sin(pi/9).

So this telescopes: all terms cancel except the first positive term from n=1, which is 9 sin(pi/3)/4, and the remaining terms converge to the limit of the negative terms as n approaches infinity.

Wait, but the general term for the positive part is 3^{n+1} sin(pi/3^n). When n approaches infinity, 3^{n+1} sin(pi/3^n). Let's see what this term does as n becomes large.

Note that as n -> infinity, pi/3^n becomes very small, so sin(pi/3^n) ~ pi/3^n.

So, 3^{n+1} sin(pi/3^n) ≈ 3^{n+1} (pi / 3^n) = 3^{n+1} * pi / 3^n = 3 pi

Therefore, as n approaches infinity, 3^{n+1} sin(pi/3^n) approaches 3 pi. Therefore, does the positive term approach 3 pi as n approaches infinity? Wait, but we have 3^{n+1} sin(pi/3^n) for each n. As n gets large, sin(pi/3^n) ≈ pi/3^n, so:

3^{n+1} sin(pi/3^n) ≈ 3^{n+1} * pi / 3^n = 3 pi

Therefore, each term 3^{n+1} sin(pi/3^n) approaches 3 pi. Wait, but this is for each n, not as n goes to infinity. Hmm, maybe I need to think again.

Wait, the general term in the telescoping series is (3^{n+1} sin(pi/3^n) - 3^n sin(pi/3^{n-1}))/4. So when we sum from n=1 to infinity, the telescoping leaves:

= (1/4) [ limit_{N->infty} (3^{N+1} sin(pi/3^N) - 3^1 sin(pi/3^0)) ]

Because all the intermediate terms cancel out. So S = (1/4)[ lim_{N->infty} 3^{N+1} sin(pi/3^N) - 3*sin(pi) ]

But sin(pi) is zero, so S = (1/4) lim_{N->infty} [3^{N+1} sin(pi/(3^N))]

Alright, let's compute this limit. Let me set m = 3^N, so as N -> infinity, m -> infinity, and:

3^{N+1} sin(pi / 3^N) = 3 * 3^N sin(pi / 3^N) = 3 m sin(pi/m)

As m -> infinity, m sin(pi/m) approaches m*(pi/m) = pi, so m sin(pi/m) -> pi. Therefore, the entire expression 3 m sin(pi/m) approaches 3 * pi. 

Hence, S = (1/4) * 3 pi = (3 pi)/4 ≈ (3 * 3.1415926535)/4 ≈ 9.42477796 / 4 ≈ 2.35619449.

Wait, so if the sum S is (3 pi)/4, which is about 2.35619449, then 100 times that is about 235.619449. Therefore, the nearest integer would be 236.

Wait, but is that correct? Because we need to double-check. So S is (3 pi)/4? Let me confirm.

Wait, let's recap. We started by expressing sin^3(theta) in terms of sin(3 theta) and sin(theta), which gives that identity. Then we plugged that into the series, which telescopes, so the sum becomes (1/4) times the limit of 3^{N+1} sin(pi/3^N) as N approaches infinity, since all the middle terms cancel out. Then, calculating that limit, we find that it equals 3 pi, so 1/4 of that is 3 pi /4, which is correct. Then 100 * 3 pi /4 = 75 pi, which is approximately 235.619.

So, 75 pi is exactly 235.619449..., so rounding to the nearest integer gives 236.

But wait, just to be thorough, let me make sure we didn't make any mistakes in telescoping.

Starting from n=1 to infinity:

Each term is [3^{n+1} sin(pi/3^n) - 3^n sin(pi/3^{n-1})]/4

So sum_n=1^infty of [3^{n+1} sin(pi/3^n)/4 -3^n sin(pi/3^{n-1})/4]

Which can be separated into two series:

Sum [3^{n+1} sin(pi/3^n)/4] - Sum [3^n sin(pi/3^{n-1})/4]

First series: let's index shift. Let k = n + 1, so when n=1, k=2. But maybe it's easier to notice that 3^{n+1} is like 3*3^n. So:

Sum_{n=1}^\infty [3*3^n sin(pi/3^n)/4] = 3/4 Sum_{n=1}^\infty [3^n sin(pi/3^n)]

Second series:

Sum_{n=1}^\infty [3^n sin(pi/3^{n-1})/4] = 1/4 Sum_{n=1}^\infty [3^n sin(pi/3^{n-1})]

Now, notice that in the second series, the term 3^n sin(pi/3^{n-1}) can be rewritten by shifting index. Let m = n - 1. Then n = m + 1. When n=1, m=0. So:

1/4 Sum_{m=0}^\infty [3^{m+1} sin(pi/3^m)] = 3/4 Sum_{m=0}^\infty [3^m sin(pi/3^m)}

So together, the original sum S can be written as:

3/4 Sum_{n=1}^\infty [3^n sin(pi/3^n)] - 3/4 Sum_{m=0}^\infty [3^m sin(pi/3^m)] =

= (3/4 [ Sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n - Sum_{m=0}^\infty a_m ] )

Where a_k = 3^k sin(pi/3^k)

Therefore, the difference between Sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n and Sum_{m=0}^\infty a_m is just -a_0.

So:

Sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n - Sum_{m=0}^\infty a_m = -a_0 = -3^0 sin(pi/3^0) = -sin(pi) = -0 = 0. Wait, but that seems conflicting.

Wait, suppose S = 3/4 [ Sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n - (Sum_{m=0}^\infty a_m) ]

Which is 3/4 [ (Sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n) - (a_0 + Sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n ) ) ] = 3/4 [ -a_0 ] = 3/4 [ -sin(pi) ] = 0? Wait, that's not possible.

Wait, so this approach may not capture the limit correctly. Hmm, perhaps the previous telescoping argument was incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the telescoping sum is:

Original series sum is [sum_{n=1}^\infty (3^{n+1} sin(pi/3^n) - 3^n sin(pi/3^{n-1}) ) ] /4.

Which is equal to [lim_{N->infty} (3^{N+1} sin(pi/3^N) - 3^1 sin(pi/3^0) ) ] /4.

Since sin(pi/3^0) = sin(pi) = 0, and as N approaches infinity, 3^{N+1} sin(pi/3^N) ~ 3^{N+1} * pi /3^N = 3 pi.

Thus, the limit is (3 pi -0 ) /4 = 3 pi /4. So I think the original conclusion stands.

So, perhaps the confusion from separating the sums is due to not considering the limit correctly.

Given that, yes, the telescoping sum approach is valid, and the sum S is indeed equal to 3 pi /4. Thus, multiplying by 100 gives 75 pi, approximately 235.619, which rounds to 236.

But let me verify this with actual computation of the first few terms to see how quickly the series converges. Since we have a telescoping series, the partial sum up to N is [3^{N+1} sin(pi/3^N) - 3 sin(pi)] /4. As sin(pi) is 0, the partial sum is [3^{N+1} sin(pi/3^N)] /4. Then, as N increases, 3^{N+1} sin(pi/3^N) approaches 3 pi, so the partial sums approach 3 pi /4. Therefore, even for small N, the partial sum is already approaching that value. Let's compute the first few partial sums.

For N=1: [3^{2} sin(pi/3^1)]/4 = 9 sin(pi/3)/4 ≈ 9*(sqrt(3)/2)/4 ≈ 9*0.8660/4 ≈ 9*0.2165 ≈ 1.948

For N=2: [3^{3} sin(pi/3^2)]/4 = 27 sin(pi/9)/4 ≈ 27*0.3420/4 ≈ 27*0.0855 ≈ 2.3085

For N=3: [3^4 sin(pi/27)]/4 ≈ 81* sin(pi/27)/4. Let me compute pi/27≈0.1164 radians. sin(0.1164)≈0.1162. So, 81*0.1162≈9.4122/4≈2.353

For N=4: [3^5 sin(pi/81)]/4. 3^5=243, pi/81 ≈0.0388 radians. sin(0.0388)≈0.0387. So 243*0.0387≈9.4061/4≈2.3515

For N=5: [3^6 sin(pi/243)]/4 = 729*sin(pi/243)/4. pi/243≈0.0129 radians. sin(0.0129)≈0.0129. So 729*0.0129≈9.42 /4≈2.355

It oscillates around the limit of approximately 2.356 (which is 3 pi /4 ≈2.35619449...). So each term alternates being slightly less and then slightly more? But in reality, as the approximation sin(x)≈x -x^3/6+... we can see the next term in the expansion for higher precision.

Wait, but even so, computing up to N=5 gives us 2.355, which is already converging to 3 pi /4. So the sum indeed converges to 3 pi /4. Therefore, multiplying by 100, we get 75 pi≈235.619...

Therefore, the nearest integer is 236. So the answer is \boxed{236}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{236}

3^{N+1} sin(pi / 3^N) = 3 * 3^N sin(pi / 3^N) = 3 m sin(pi/m)

= (1/4) [ limit_{N->infty} (3^{N+1} sin(pi/3^N) - 3^1 sin(pi/3^0)) ]</text>
<explanation>The solver correctly applies the telescoping series property to express the infinite sum in terms of the limiting term and the first term, demonstrating mastery of this technique.</explanation>

<text>But let me verify this with actual computation of the first few terms to see how quickly the series converges. Since we have a telescoping series, the partial sum up to N is [3^{N+1} sin(pi/3^N) - 3 sin(pi)] /4. As sin(pi) is 0, the partial sum is [3^{N+1} sin(pi/3^N)] /4.</text>
<explanation>The solver correctly formulates the expression for the Nth partial sum of the
