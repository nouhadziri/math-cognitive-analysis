Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the maximum possible area of a rectangle $AQRS$ that circumscribes a given triangle $ABC$. The vertices of the triangle are related to the sides of the rectangle.

Let the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle be $A=(0,0)$, $Q=(w,0)$, $R=(w,h)$, $S=(0,h)$, where $w$ is the width and $h$ is the height of the rectangle.
The coordinates of the vertices of the triangle $ABC$ can be $(x_A, y_A), (x_B, y_B), (x_C, y_C)$.
Since the triangle is inscribed in the rectangle with $A$ at one corner, we can assume $A$ coincides with one of the vertices of the rectangle. Let $A=(0,0)$.

The vertices of the triangle are located such that $B$ is on $\overline{QR}$ and $C$ is on $\overline{RS}$.
The coordinates of the points on the sides of the rectangle are:
- $\overline{QR}$: $x=w$, $0 \le y \le h$
- $\overline{RS}$: $0 \le x \le w$, $y=h$

So, $B=(w, y_B)$ with $0 \le y_B \le h$, and $C=(x_C, h)$ with $0 \le x_C \le w$.

The lengths of the sides of the triangle are $AB=40$, $AC=31$.
We are given $\sin{A}=\frac{1}{5}$. Since $\sin^2{A} + \cos^2{A} = 1$, we have $\cos^2{A} = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{25} = \frac{24}{25}$.
So, $\cos{A} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{24}}{5} = \pm \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}$.

Case 1: $\cos{A} = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}$
Using the Law of Cosines on triangle $ABC$:
$BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \cos{A}$
$BC^2 = 40^2 + 31^2 - 2 \cdot 40 \cdot 31 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}$
$BC^2 = 1600 + 961 - 80 \cdot 31 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5} = 2561 - 16 \cdot 31 \cdot 2\sqrt{6} = 2561 - 992\sqrt{6}$

Case 2: $\cos{A} = -\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}$
$BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \cos{A}$
$BC^2 = 40^2 + 31^2 - 2 \cdot 40 \cdot 31 \cdot \left(-\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}\right)$
$BC^2 = 1600 + 961 + 80 \cdot 31 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5} = 2561 + 992\sqrt{6}$

Now, let's consider the orientation of the triangle within the rectangle.
Since $A$ is at the origin, the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle are:
$B=(x_B, y_B)$ and $C=(x_C, y_C)$.
From the problem statement, the rectangle is $AQRS$, so the vertices are ordered.

Let's use vectors. $\vec{AB}$ and $\vec{AC}$ originate from $A$.
Place the coordinate system such that $A=(0,0)$.
The coordinates of $B$ can be $(AB \cos \theta_1, AB \sin \theta_1)$ and $C$ can be $(AC \cos \theta_2, AC \sin \theta_2)$, where $\theta_2 - \theta_1 = \angle BAC = A$.

Consider the configuration where $A$ is at the origin.
The sides of the rectangle are aligned with the axes.
$Q$ is on the x-axis, $S$ is on the y-axis.
The width of the rectangle is $w$, the height is $h$.
Coordinates: $A=(0,0), Q=(w,0), R=(w,h), S=(0,h)$.

Since $B$ is on $\overline{QR}$, $B=(w, y_B)$ with $0 \le y_B \le h$.
Since $C$ is on $\overline{RS}$, $C=(x_C, h)$ with $0 \le x_C \le w$.

We have vectors $\vec{AB} = (w, y_B)$ and $\vec{AC} = (x_C, h)$.
Lengths: $|\vec{AB}|^2 = w^2 + y_B^2 = 40^2 = 1600$
$|\vec{AC}|^2 = x_C^2 + h^2 = 31^2 = 961$

Dot product: $\vec{AB} \cdot \vec{AC} = |\vec{AB}| |\vec{AC}| \cos{A}$
$w x_C + y_B h = 40 \cdot 31 \cdot \cos{A} = 1240 \cos{A}$

If $\cos{A} = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}$, then $w x_C + y_B h = 1240 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5} = 248 \cdot 2\sqrt{6} = 496\sqrt{6}$.
If $\cos{A} = -\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}$, then $w x_C + y_B h = 1240 \cdot \left(-\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}\right) = -496\sqrt{6}$.

We also have constraints from the rectangle:
$w > 0, h > 0$
$0 \le y_B \le h \implies y_B^2 \le h^2$
$0 \le x_C \le w \implies x_C^2 \le w^2$

From $w^2 + y_B^2 = 1600$, we have $w^2 \le 1600 \implies w \le 40$.
From $x_C^2 + h^2 = 961$, we have $h^2 \le 961 \implies h \le 31$.

The area of the rectangle is $Area = wh$. We want to maximize this.

Consider the projection of the triangle onto the axes.
The bounding box of the triangle has width $\max(x_B, x_C) - \min(0, x_B, x_C)$ and height $\max(y_B, y_C) - \min(0, y_B, y_C)$.
Since $A$ is at the origin, and $B, C$ are in the first quadrant (due to the rectangle setup), the width of the bounding box is $\max(w, x_C)$ and the height is $\max(y_B, h)$.

We have $B=(w, y_B)$ and $C=(x_C, h)$.
Since $B$ is on the right edge and $C$ is on the top edge, we must have $w \ge x_C$ and $h \ge y_B$.
So, the width of the rectangle is $w$, the height is $h$.

We have the equations:
1. $w^2 + y_B^2 = 1600$
2. $x_C^2 + h^2 = 961$
3. $w x_C + y_B h = 1240 \cos{A}$

From (1), $y_B = \sqrt{1600 - w^2}$. Since $y_B \ge 0$, we take the positive root.
From (2), $x_C = \sqrt{961 - h^2}$. Since $x_C \ge 0$, we take the positive root.

Substitute into (3):
$w \sqrt{961 - h^2} + h \sqrt{1600 - w^2} = 1240 \cos{A}$

Let the area of the rectangle be $Area = wh$. We want to maximize this.

Consider the case when $\angle BAC$ is acute. $\cos{A} = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}$.
$w \sqrt{961 - h^2} + h \sqrt{1600 - w^2} = 496\sqrt{6}$

Consider the case when $\angle BAC$ is obtuse. $\cos{A} = -\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}$.
$w \sqrt{961 - h^2} + h \sqrt{1600 - w^2} = -496\sqrt{6}$
Since $w, h$ are positive, the left side is positive, so this case is not possible.
Thus, $\angle BAC$ must be acute, and $\cos{A} = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}$.

We need to maximize $wh$ subject to the equation.
Let $w = 40 \cos \phi$, $y_B = 40 \sin \phi$, where $0 \le \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2}$.
Let $h = 31 \sin \psi$, $x_C = 31 \cos \psi$, where $0 \le \psi \le \frac{\pi}{2}$.

Substitute into the equation:
$(40 \cos \phi)(31 \cos \psi) + (40 \sin \phi)(31 \sin \psi) = 1240 \cos{A}$
$1240 (\cos \phi \cos \psi + \sin \phi \sin \psi) = 1240 \cos{A}$
$\cos(\phi - \psi) = \cos{A}$

This means $\phi - \psi = A$ or $\phi - \psi = -A$.
So, $\phi - \psi = \pm A$.

We have $w \le 40$, $h \le 31$.
Area $= wh = (40 \cos \phi)(31 \sin \psi) = 1240 \cos \phi \sin \psi$.

Case 1: $\phi - \psi = A \implies \psi = \phi - A$
Area $= 1240 \cos \phi \sin(\phi - A) = 1240 \cos \phi (\sin \phi \cos A - \cos \phi \sin A)$
Area $= 1240 (\sin \phi \cos \phi \cos A - \cos^2 \phi \sin A)$
Area $= 1240 \left( \frac{1}{2} \sin(2\phi) \cos A - \frac{1+\cos(2\phi)}{2} \sin A \right)$
Area $= 620 (\sin(2\phi) \cos A - (1+\cos(2\phi)) \sin A)$
Area $= 620 (\sin(2\phi) \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5} - (1+\cos(2\phi)) \frac{1}{5})$
Area $= 124 \left( 2\sqrt{6} \sin(2\phi) - (1+\cos(2\phi)) \right)$
Area $= 124 (2\sqrt{6} \sin(2\phi) - 1 - \cos(2\phi))$

To maximize Area, we need to maximize $f(\phi) = 2\sqrt{6} \sin(2\phi) - \cos(2\phi)$.
$f'(\phi) = 4\sqrt{6} \cos(2\phi) + 2 \sin(2\phi) = 0$
$\tan(2\phi) = -2\sqrt{6}$

Since $0 \le \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2}$, we have $0 \le 2\phi \le \pi$.
Since $\tan(2\phi) < 0$, $2\phi$ is in the second quadrant.
Let $\tan \alpha = 2\sqrt{6}$. Then $\sin \alpha = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}$, $\cos \alpha = \frac{1}{5}$.
$2\phi = \pi - \alpha$.

Consider the geometry of the problem.
The rectangle $AQRS$ circumscribes the triangle $ABC$.
Project the vertices $B$ and $C$ onto the axes.
Coordinates of $B=(w, y_B)$, $C=(x_C, h)$.
The bounding box of the triangle has dimensions related to the rectangle.

Alternative approach:
Consider the area of the rectangle as a function of the orientation of the triangle.
Let the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle be $(0,0)$, $(40 \cos \theta, 40 \sin \theta)$, $(31 \cos (\theta+A), 31 \sin (\theta+A))$.
The rectangle has sides parallel to the axes.
The width of the rectangle is $\max(0, 40 \cos \theta, 31 \cos(\theta+A)) - \min(0, 40 \cos \theta, 31 \cos(\theta+A))$
The height of the rectangle is $\max(0, 40 \sin \theta, 31 \sin(\theta+A)) - \min(0, 40 \sin \theta, 31 \sin(\theta+A))$

Consider the case where $A$ is at the origin, one side along the x-axis.
Rotate the configuration such that the rectangle sides are parallel to the axes.

Let the equation of line $BC$ be $ax + by = c$.
The vertices of the rectangle are $(0,0), (w,0), (0,h), (w,h)$.
The equations of the lines containing the sides of the triangle are:
Line $AB$: $y = (\tan \alpha) x$, where $\alpha$ is the angle with the x-axis.
Line $AC$: $y = (\tan (\alpha+A)) x$.

Consider the supporting lines of the triangle.
The equations of the lines containing the sides of the triangle in a general position.

Consider the bounding box of the triangle when one vertex is at the origin.
Let the coordinates of the vertices be $A=(0,0), B=(x_B, y_B), C=(x_C, y_C)$.
The rectangle has corners at $(0,0), (\max(x_B, x_C), 0), (0, \max(y_B, y_C)), (\max(x_B, x_C), \max(y_B, y_C))$.
The area is $\max(x_B, x_C) \cdot \max(y_B, y_C)$.

Let's use the property that the area of the circumscribing rectangle with sides parallel to some axes is related to the projections of the triangle onto these axes.

Consider a coordinate system where $A=(0,0)$, $AB$ is along the x-axis.
$B=(40, 0)$.
$C=(31 \cos A, 31 \sin A) = (31 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}, 31 \cdot \frac{1}{5}) = (\frac{62\sqrt{6}}{5}, \frac{31}{5})$.
The bounding box has width $40$, height $\frac{31}{5}$. Area $= 40 \cdot \frac{31}{5} = 8 \cdot 31 = 248$.

Rotate the coordinate system.
Let the sides of the rectangle be at angles $\theta$ and $\theta + \frac{\pi}{2}$ with some fixed axis.
The dimensions of the rectangle are the projections of the triangle onto these directions.

Consider the projections of the vertices of the triangle onto a line at angle $\theta$.
Let the vertices be $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}$.
Project onto a unit vector $\mathbf{u} = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$.
Projections are $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{u}$.
The width of the bounding box along this direction is $\max(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{u}) - \min(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{u})$.

Let $A=(0,0)$.
$B = (40 \cos \phi, 40 \sin \phi)$
$C = (31 \cos (\phi+A), 31 \sin (\phi+A))$

Projections onto the x-axis: $0, 40 \cos \phi, 31 \cos (\phi+A)$
Projections onto the y-axis: $0, 40 \sin \phi, 31 \sin (\phi+A)$

Width of the bounding box with sides parallel to axes:
$w = \max(40 \cos \phi, 31 \cos (\phi+A)) - \min(40 \cos \phi, 31 \cos (\phi+A))$
$h = \max(40 \sin \phi, 31 \sin (\phi+A)) - \min(40 \sin \phi, 31 \sin (\phi+A))$

This approach seems complicated.

Consider the case when the sides of the rectangle are tangent to the extended sides of the triangle.

Let the area of the rectangle be $Area = wh$.
We have $w^2 + y_B^2 = 1600$ and $x_C^2 + h^2 = 961$.
Maximize $wh$ subject to $w x_C + y_B h = 1240 \cos A$.

Try some specific configurations.
If the rectangle aligns with the triangle such that $A$ is at a corner.
Suppose the sides of the rectangle are tangent to the triangle at $B$ and $C$.

Let's use the result that the minimum area of a circumscribing rectangle with sides parallel to some directions is obtained when these directions are along the eigenvectors of a certain matrix.

Consider the interpretation of the problem statement carefully.
Rectangle $AQRS$ with $B$ on $\overline{QR}$ and $C$ on $\overline{RS}$.
This implies a specific orientation of the triangle relative to the rectangle.
Assume $A$ is at the origin. $Q=(w,0), R=(w,h), S=(0,h)$.
$B=(w, y_B)$, $C=(x_C, h)$.

We found $\cos(\phi - \psi) = \cos A$, where $w = 40 \cos \phi, y_B = 40 \sin \phi$, $x_C = 31 \cos \psi, h = 31 \sin \psi$.
Area $= wh = 1240 \cos \phi \sin \psi$.

Case 1: $\phi - \psi = A \implies \psi = \phi - A$
Area $= 1240 \cos \phi \sin(\phi - A) = 1240 \cos \phi (\sin \phi \cos A - \cos \phi \sin A)$

Case 2: $\phi - \psi = -A \implies \psi = \phi + A$
Area $= 1240 \cos \phi \sin(\phi + A) = 1240 \cos \phi (\sin \phi \cos A + \cos \phi \sin A)$
Area $= 1240 (\sin \phi \cos \phi \cos A + \cos^2 \phi \sin A)$
Area $= 620 (\sin(2\phi) \cos A + (1+\cos(2\phi)) \sin A)$
Area $= 620 (\sin(2\phi) \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5} + (1+\cos(2\phi)) \frac{1}{5})$
Area $= 124 (2\sqrt{6} \sin(2\phi) + 1 + \cos(2\phi))$

Maximize $g(\phi) = 2\sqrt{6} \sin(2\phi) + \cos(2\phi)$.
$g'(\phi) = 4\sqrt{6} \cos(2\phi) - 2 \sin(2\phi) = 0$
$\tan(2\phi) = 2\sqrt{6}$.
$\sin(2\phi) = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}$, $\cos(2\phi) = \frac{1}{5}$.
Max value of $g(\phi) = 2\sqrt{6} \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{24}{5} + \frac{1}{5} = 5$.
Max Area $= 124 (5 + 1) = 124 \cdot 6 = 744$.

Constraints on $\phi$:
$w = 40 \cos \phi > 0 \implies 0 \le \phi < \frac{\pi}{2}$
$h = 31 \sin \psi > 0 \implies 0 < \psi \le \frac{\pi}{2}$

If $\psi = \phi + A$, and $A$ is acute.
If $\phi$ is small, $\psi$ can be small.
If $\phi$ is near $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\psi$ is near $\frac{\pi}{2} + A > \frac{\pi}{2}$.

Need $0 < \phi + A \le \frac{\pi}{2}$.
$0 < \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} - A$.

If $\tan(2\phi) = 2\sqrt{6}$, then $2\phi = \arctan(2\sqrt{6})$.
Since $2\sqrt{6} \approx 2 \cdot 2.45 = 4.9$, $\arctan(4.9)$ is between $0$ and $\frac{\pi}{2}$.
So, $0 < 2\phi < \frac{\pi}{2}$.
$0 < \phi < \frac{\pi}{4}$.

<text>Case 1: $\cos{A} = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}$
Using the Law of Cosines on triangle $ABC$:
$BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \cos{A}$
$BC^2 = 40^2 + 31^2 - 2 \cdot 40 \cdot 31 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}$
$BC^2 = 1600 + 961 - 80 \cdot 31 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5} = 2561 - 16 \cdot 31 \cdot 2\sqrt{6} = 2561 - 992\sqrt{6}$</text>
