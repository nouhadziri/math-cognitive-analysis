Problem:
A.4 In the ultrarelativistic limit, the energy of the electron as a function of time is:

$$
E(t)=\frac{E_{0}}{1+\alpha E_{0} t},
$$

where $E_{0}$ is the initial energy of the electron. Find $\alpha$ as a function of $e, c, B, \epsilon_{0}$ and $m$.

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
The power emitted by the particle is given by,

$$
P=-\frac{\mathrm{d} E}{\mathrm{~d} t}=\frac{e^{4}}{6 \pi \epsilon_{0} m^{4} c^{5}} E^{2} B^{2}
$$

The energy of the particle as a function of time can be calculated from

$$
\int_{E_{0}}^{E(t)} \frac{1}{E^{2}} \mathrm{~d} E=-\int_{0}^{t} \frac{e^{4}}{6 \pi \epsilon_{0} m^{4} c^{5}} B^{2} \mathrm{~d} t
$$

where $E(0)=E_{0}$. This leads to,

$$
\frac{1}{E(t)}-\frac{1}{E_{0}}=\frac{e^{4} B^{2}}{6 \pi \epsilon_{0} m^{4} c^{5}} t \quad \Rightarrow \quad E(t)=\frac{E_{0}}{1+\alpha E_{0} t},
$$

<text>The power emitted by the particle is given by,

$$
P=-\frac{\mathrm{d} E}{\mathrm{~d} t}=\frac{e^{4}}{6 \pi \epsilon_{0} m^{4} c^{5}} E^{2} B^{2}
$$</text>
<explanation>The solver begins by recognizing and stating a relevant equation from physics that relates the power emitted by a charged particle to its energy. This demonstrates the ability to retrieve domain-specific knowledge and identify the appropriate starting point for solving the problem.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Reformulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to transform a problem or equation into an alternative, more tractable form that facilitates solution.</definition>

<start>70</start>
<end>178</end>
<text>The energy of the particle as a function of time can be calculated from

$$
\int_{E_{0}}^{E(t)} \frac{1}{E^{2}} \mathrm{~d} E=-\int_{0}^{t} \frac{e^{4}}{6 \pi \epsilon_{0} m^{4} c^{5}} B^{2} \mathrm{~d} t
$$</text>
<explanation>The solver reformulates the differential equation for power (P = -dE/dt) into an integral equation. This transformation changes the problem from finding a rate of change to evaluating definite integrals, which is often more straightforward to solve. This demonstrates the ability to recast problems into more solvable forms.</explanation>

<skill>Integration Execution</skill>
<definition>The ability to correctly perform integration operations, including setting up appropriate limits and handling variables properly.</definition>

<start>70</start>
<end>244</end>
<text>The energy of the particle as a function of time can be calculated from

$$
\int_{E_{0}}^{E(t)} \frac{1}{E^{2}} \mathrm{~d} E=-\int_{0}^{t} \frac{e^{4}}{6 \pi \epsilon_{0} m^{4} c^{5}} B^{2} \mathrm{~d} t
$$

where $E(0)=E_{0}$. This leads to,

$$
\frac{1}{E(t)}-\frac{1}{E_{0}}=\frac{e^{4} B^{2}}{6 \pi \epsilon_{0} m^{4} c^{5}} t</text>
<explanation>The solver correctly executes the integration on both sides of the equation. On the left side, the integral of 1/E² with respect to E is evaluated as -1/E, with the proper application of limits. On the right side, the constant terms are pulled out of the integral, resulting in a simple multiplication by t. This demonstrates proficiency in applying integration techniques.</explanation>

<skill>Pattern Matching</skill>
<definition>The ability to recognize mathematical patterns and match given expressions with standard forms to identify relationships or solution approaches.</definition>

<start>244</start>
<end>307</end>
<text> \quad \Rightarrow \quad E(t)=\frac{E_{0}}{1+\alpha E_{0} t},
$$</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that the derived expression can be rearranged to match the target form given in the problem statement. This pattern matching allows them to identify what α must be in terms of the other parameters. This demonstrates the ability to connect derived results with target expressions.</explanation>

<skill>Parameter Identification</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and extract specific parameters from equations by comparing equivalent expressions.</definition>

<start>180</start>
<end>307</end>
<text>This leads to,

$$
\frac{1}{E(t)}-\frac{1}{E_{0}}=\frac{e^{4} B^{2}}{6 \pi \epsilon_{0} m^{4} c^{5}} t \quad \Rightarrow \quad E(t)=\frac{E_{0}}{1+\alpha E_{0} t},
$$</text>
<explanation>By comparing the derived expression with the target form, the solver implicitly identifies that α must equal e⁴B²/(6πε₀m⁴c⁵). This demonstrates the ability to extract parameter values by equating coefficients in equivalent expressions.</explanation>

<skill>Algebraic Manipulation</skill>
<definition>The ability to rearrange algebraic expressions through valid operations to transform them into desired forms.</definition>

$$</text>
<explanation>The solver performs algebraic manipulations to transform the expression from the form "1/E(t) - 1/E₀ = coefficient × t" to "E(t) = E₀/(1 + coefficient × E₀ × t)". This requires solving for E(t) and rearranging terms, demonstrating proficiency in algebraic transformation.</explanation>

<skill>Initial Condition Application</skill>
<definition>The ability to apply given initial conditions to constrain and solve differential equations or other mathematical models.</definition>
