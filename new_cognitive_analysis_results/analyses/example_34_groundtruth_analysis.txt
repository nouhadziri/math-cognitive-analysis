Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
To solve the given integral equations using Laplace transforms, we proceed as follows:

1. **Transform the first equation:**
   \[
   x(t) = 1 + \int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t-s)} x(s) \, ds
   \]
   Taking the Laplace transform of both sides, we get:
   \[
   \mathcal{L}\{x(t)\} = \mathcal{L}\{1\} + \mathcal{L}\left\{\int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t-s)} x(s) \, ds\right\}
   \]
   Using the property of the Laplace transform for convolution, we have:
   \[
   X(s) = \frac{1}{s} + \mathcal{L}\{e^{-2t}\} \cdot X(s)
   \]
   Since \(\mathcal{L}\{e^{-2t}\} = \frac{1}{s+2}\), we get:
   \[
   X(s) = \frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{s+2} X(s)
   \]
   Solving for \(X(s)\):
   \[
   X(s) - \frac{1}{s+2} X(s) = \frac{1}{s}
   \]
   \[
   X(s) \left(1 - \frac{1}{s+2}\right) = \frac{1}{s}
   \]
   \[
   X(s) \left(\frac{s+1}{s+2}\right) = \frac{1}{s}
   \]
   \[
   X(s) = \frac{1}{s} \cdot \frac{s+2}{s+1} = \frac{s+2}{s(s+1)}
   \]
   Using partial fraction decomposition:
   \[
   \frac{s+2}{s(s+1)} = \frac{A}{s} + \frac{B}{s+1}
   \]
   Solving for \(A\) and \(B\):
   \[
   s+2 = A(s+1) + Bs
   \]
   Setting \(s = 0\):
   \[
   2 = A \implies A = 2
   \]
   Setting \(s = -1\):
   \[
   1 = -B \implies B = -1
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   X(s) = \frac{2}{s} - \frac{1}{s+1}
   \]
   Taking the inverse Laplace transform:
   \[
   x(t) = 2 - e^{-t}
   \]

2. **Transform the second equation:**
   \[
   y(t) = \int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t-s)} \{2x(s) + 3y(s)\} \, ds
   \]
   Taking the Laplace transform of both sides, we get:
   \[
   Y(s) = \mathcal{L}\left\{\int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t-s)} \{2x(s) + 3y(s)\} \, ds\right\}
   \]
   Using the property of the Laplace transform for convolution, we have:
   \[
   Y(s) = \frac{1}{s+2} \left(2X(s) + 3Y(s)\right)
   \]
   Substituting \(X(s)\):
   \[
   Y(s) = \frac{1}{s+2} \left(2 \left(\frac{s+2}{s(s+1)}\right) + 3Y(s)\right)
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   Y(s) = \frac{2(s+2)}{s(s+1)(s+2)} + \frac{3Y(s)}{s+2}
   \]
   \[
   Y(s) = \frac{2}{s(s+1)} + \frac{3Y(s)}{s+2}
   \]
   Solving for \(Y(s)\):
   \[
   Y(s) \left(1 - \frac{3}{s+2}\right) = \frac{2}{s(s+1)}
   \]
   \[
   Y(s) \left(\frac{s-1}{s+2}\right) = \frac{2}{s(s+1)}
   \]
   \[
   Y(s) = \frac{2}{s(s+1)} \cdot \frac{s+2}{s-1} = \frac{2(s+2)}{s(s+1)(s-1)}
   \]
   Using partial fraction decomposition:
   \[
   \frac{2(s+2)}{s(s+1)(s-1)} = \frac{A}{s} + \frac{B}{s+1} + \frac{C}{s-1}
   \]
   Solving for \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\):
   \[
   2(s+2) = A(s+1)(s-1) + Bs(s-1) + Cs(s+1)
   \]
   Setting \(s = 0\):
   \[
   4 = A(-1) \implies A = -4
   \]
   Setting \(s = -1\):
   \[
   -2 = B(-2) \implies B = 1
   \]
   Setting \(s = 1\):
   \[
   4 = C(2) \implies C = 2
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   Y(s) = \frac{-4}{s} + \frac{1}{s+1} + \frac{2}{s-1}
   \]
   Taking the inverse Laplace transform:
   \[
   y(t) = -4 + e^{-t} + 2e^{t}
   \]

The final answer is \( \boxed{ x(t) = 2 - e^{-t} } \) and \(y(t) = -4 + e^{-t} + 2e^{t}\).
