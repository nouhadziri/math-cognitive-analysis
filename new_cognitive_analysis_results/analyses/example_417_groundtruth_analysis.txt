Problem:
A biologist wants to calculate the number of fish in a lake. On May 1 she catches a random sample of 60 fish, tags them, and releases them. On September 1 she catches a random sample of 70 fish and finds that 3 of them are tagged. To calculate the number of fish in the lake on May 1, she assumes that  $25\%$  of these fish are no longer in the lake on September 1 (because of death and emigrations), that  $40\%$  of the fish were not in the lake May 1 (because of births and immigrations), and that the number of untagged fish and tagged fish in the September 1 sample are representative of the total population. What does the biologist calculate for the number of fish in the lake on May 1?

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Determine the number of tagged fish remaining in the lake on September 1:**
   - Initially, 60 fish were tagged on May 1.
   - Given that 25% of the tagged fish had died or emigrated, 75% of the tagged fish remain.
   \[
   \text{Remaining tagged fish} = 60 \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = 60 \times 0.75 = 45
   \]

2. **Determine the number of fish in the September 1 sample that were originally in the lake on May 1:**
   - The biologist caught a sample of 70 fish on September 1.
   - Given that 40% of the fish in the lake on September 1 were not there on May 1, 60% of the fish in the sample were originally there on May 1.
   \[
   \text{Fish originally in the lake on May 1 in the sample} = 70 \times \left(\frac{6}{10}\right) = 70 \times 0.6 = 42
   \]

3. **Determine the ratio of tagged to untagged fish in the September 1 sample:**
   - Out of the 42 fish that were originally in the lake on May 1, 3 were tagged.
   \[
   \text{Ratio of tagged to untagged fish} = \frac{3}{42} = \frac{1}{14}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of fish in the lake on May 1:**
   - The ratio of tagged to untagged fish on May 1 was \(\frac{1}{14}\).
   - Therefore, for every tagged fish, there were 14 untagged fish.
   - Since there were 45 tagged fish remaining, the total number of fish originally in the lake on May 1 can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total number of fish on May 1} = 14 \times \text{number of tagged fish} = 14 \times 45 = 630
   \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{630}\).

   \[
   \text{Total number of fish on May 1} = 14 \times \text{number of tagged fish} = 14 \times 45 = 630
   \]</text>

   - The biologist caught a sample of 70 fish on September 1.
   - Given that 40% of the fish in the lake on September 1 were not there on May 1, 60% of the fish in the sample were originally there on May 1.

   \]</text>
<explanation>The solver makes a logical inference by deducing that if 40% of fish are new (not there on May 1), then the complementary percentage (60%) must represent fish that were originally in the lake, applying this inference to determine how many fish in the sample were from the original population.</explanation>
