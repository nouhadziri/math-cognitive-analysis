Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the ratio of the volume of a regular octahedron to the volume of a cube, where the vertices of the cube are the centers of the faces of the octahedron.

Let the regular octahedron have vertices $(\pm a, 0, 0), (0, \pm a, 0), (0, 0, \pm a).$ This octahedron can be thought of as two square pyramids joined at their bases. The base is a square in the $xy$-plane with vertices $(a, 0, 0), (0, a, 0), (-a, 0, 0), (0, -a, 0).$  The vertices of the base should be $(\pm a, 0, 0)$ and $(0, \pm a, 0)$. Let's rethink the vertices.

Consider a regular octahedron centered at the origin. Let the vertices be $(\pm b, 0, 0), (0, \pm b, 0), (0, 0, \pm b).$ The faces of this octahedron are equilateral triangles. Consider the face in the octant $x, y, z > 0.$ The vertices are $(b, 0, 0), (0, b, 0), (0, 0, b).$ The equation of the plane containing these three points is $\frac{x}{b} + \frac{y}{b} + \frac{z}{b} = 1,$ or $x + y + z = b.$

The faces of the octahedron are given by the planes $\pm x \pm y \pm z = b,$ where an odd number of minus signs are used.
The 8 faces are:
$x + y + z = b$
$-x + y + z = b$
$x - y + z = b$
$x + y - z = b$
$-x - y + z = b$
$-x + y - z = b$
$x - y - z = b$
$-x - y - z = b$

Let's find the centers of these faces. The center of a triangle with vertices $A, B, C$ is $\frac{A+B+C}{3}.$

Consider the face with vertices $(b, 0, 0), (0, b, 0), (0, 0, b).$ The center is $\left(\frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3}\right).$

Consider the face with vertices $(-b, 0, 0), (0, b, 0), (0, 0, b).$ The center is $\left(-\frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3}\right).$

The centers of the faces are:
$(\frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3})$
$(-\frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3})$
$(\frac{b}{3}, -\frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3})$
$(\frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3}, -\frac{b}{3})$
$(-\frac{b}{3}, -\frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3})$
$(-\frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3}, -\frac{b}{3})$
$(\frac{b}{3}, -\frac{b}{3}, -\frac{b}{3})$
$(-\frac{b}{3}, -\frac{b}{3}, -\frac{b}{3})$

These are the vertices of the cube $C.$ The coordinates of the vertices of the cube are $\left(\pm \frac{b}{3}, \pm \frac{b}{3}, \pm \frac{b}{3}\right).$
The side length of this cube is the distance between adjacent vertices, e.g., $(\frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3})$ and $(-\frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3}, \frac{b}{3}).$
Distance $= \sqrt{\left(\frac{b}{3} - (-\frac{b}{3})\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b}{3} - \frac{b}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b}{3} - \frac{b}{3}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2b}{3}\right)^2} = \frac{2b}{3}.$
The side length of the cube $C$ is $s_C = \frac{2b}{3}.$

The volume of the cube $C$ is $V_C = s_C^3 = \left(\frac{2b}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{8b^3}{27}.$

Now, let's find the volume of the regular octahedron $O.$
The octahedron can be considered as two square pyramids joined at their bases. The vertices are $(\pm b, 0, 0), (0, \pm b, 0), (0, 0, \pm b).$
Consider the square base in the $xy$-plane with vertices $(b, 0, 0), (0, b, 0), (-b, 0, 0), (0, -b, 0).$ This doesn't form a square.

Let's use a different approach to find the volume of the octahedron.
The regular octahedron with vertices $(\pm b, 0, 0), (0, \pm b, 0), (0, 0, \pm b)$ can be inscribed in a cube with vertices $(\pm b, \pm b, \pm b).$ The volume of this cube is $(2b)^3 = 8b^3.$ The octahedron is obtained by removing 6 congruent pyramids from the corners of the cube. Each pyramid has a square base with side length $b,$ and height $b.$ The vertices of one such pyramid are $(b, b, b), (b, b, 0), (b, 0, b), (0, b, b).$ The base is the triangle with vertices $(b, b, 0), (b, 0, b), (0, b, b).$ This is not correct.

Consider the octahedron as two square pyramids with a common base. The vertices are $(\pm b, 0, 0), (0, \pm b, 0), (0, 0, \pm b).$
Let the vertices be $(\pm a, 0, 0), (0, \pm a, 0), (0, 0, \pm a).$
The square base can be considered in the $xy$-plane with vertices $(a, 0, 0), (0, a, 0), (-a, 0, 0), (0, -a, 0).$ This is not a square.

Let's use the formula for the volume of a regular octahedron with edge length $s.$ $V = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} s^3.$
We need to find the edge length of the octahedron. The distance between two adjacent vertices, e.g., $(b, 0, 0)$ and $(0, b, 0),$ is $\sqrt{(b-0)^2 + (0-b)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \sqrt{b^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{2b^2} = b\sqrt{2}.$
The edge length of the octahedron is $s_O = b\sqrt{2}.$

The volume of the octahedron $O$ is $V_O = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} (b\sqrt{2})^3 = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} b^3 (2\sqrt{2}) = \frac{4b^3}{3}.$

The ratio of the volume of $O$ to that of $C$ is $\frac{V_O}{V_C} = \frac{\frac{4b^3}{3}}{\frac{8b^3}{27}} = \frac{4b^3}{3} \times \frac{27}{8b^3} = \frac{4 \times 27}{3 \times 8} = \frac{108}{24} = \frac{54}{12} = \frac{27}{6} = \frac{9}{2}.$
The ratio is $\frac{9}{2}.$ So, $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{9}{2}.$
$m = 9, n = 2.$
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, $gcd(9, 2) = 1.$
$m+n = 9+2 = 11.$

Let's verify the calculations.

Alternative approach: Consider a regular octahedron with edge length $a.$
The dual of this octahedron is a cube. The vertices of the cube are the centers of the faces of the octahedron.
Let the octahedron have vertices $(\pm c, 0, 0), (0, \pm c, 0), (0, 0, \pm c).$
The edge length is $\sqrt{(c-0)^2 + (0-c)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \sqrt{c^2 + c^2} = c\sqrt{2}.$
So, $a = c\sqrt{2},$ which means $c = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}.$

The coordinates of the vertices of the octahedron are $\left(\pm \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0\right), \left(0, \pm \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, 0\right), \left(0, 0, \pm \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right).$
The centers of the faces of this octahedron are $\left(\pm \frac{c}{3}, \pm \frac{c}{3}, \pm \frac{c}{3}\right)$ with an even number of minus signs.
The coordinates of the vertices of the cube are $\left(\pm \frac{a}{3\sqrt{2}}, \pm \frac{a}{3\sqrt{2}}, \pm \frac{a}{3\sqrt{2}}\right)$ with an even number of minus signs.
This is not correct.

Consider the octahedron with edge length $a.$ Place the vertices at $(\pm \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0), (0, \pm \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, 0), (0, 0, \pm \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}).$
Distance between $(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0)$ and $(0, \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, 0)$ is $\sqrt{(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}})^2 + (-\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}})^2} = \sqrt{\frac{a^2}{2} + \frac{a^2}{2}} = \sqrt{a^2} = a.$ The edge length is indeed $a.$

The centers of the faces are $\left(\pm \frac{a}{3\sqrt{2}}, \pm \frac{a}{3\sqrt{2}}, \pm \frac{a}{3\sqrt{2}}\right),$ where the signs are either all positive, or two negative and one positive, etc.
The vertices of the cube are $\left(\pm \frac{a}{3\sqrt{2}}, \pm \frac{a}{3\sqrt{2}}, \pm \frac{a}{3\sqrt{2}}\right).$
The side length of the cube is $2 \times \frac{a}{3\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2a}{3\sqrt{2}} = \frac{a\sqrt{2}}{3}.$

Volume of the cube $C$: $V_C = \left(\frac{a\sqrt{2}}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{a^3 (2\sqrt{2})}{27} = \frac{2\sqrt{2} a^3}{27}.$

Volume of the octahedron $O$: $V_O = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} a^3.$

Ratio $\frac{V_O}{V_C} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} a^3}{\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{27} a^3} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \times \frac{27}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{27}{6} = \frac{9}{2}.$
This confirms the previous result.

Let's try another approach. Consider an octahedron with vertices on the axes at distance 1 from the origin: $(\pm 1, 0, 0), (0, \pm 1, 0), (0, 0, \pm 1).$
The edge length is $\sqrt{2}.$
Volume of this octahedron: $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} (\sqrt{2})^3 = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} (2\sqrt{2}) = \frac{4}{3}.$

The centers of the faces are $(\pm \frac{1}{3}, \pm \frac{1}{3}, \pm \frac{1}{3}),$ with an odd number of minus signs.
Vertices of the cube: $(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}), (-\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}), ...$
Side length of the cube: $\frac{2}{3}.$
Volume of the cube: $(\frac{2}{3})^3 = \frac{8}{27}.$

Ratio of volumes: $\frac{V_O}{V_C} = \frac{4/3}{8/27} = \frac{4}{3} \times \frac{27}{8} = \frac{108}{24} = \frac{54}{12} = \frac{27}{6} = \frac{9}{2}.$
This confirms the result again.

Let's try to solve this using duality.
The dual of a regular octahedron is a cube.
If the octahedron has edge length $a,$ the dual cube has edge length related to the distance between the centers of adjacent faces of the octahedron.

Consider a regular octahedron with vertices $(\pm 1, 0, 0), (0, \pm 1, 0), (0, 0, \pm 1).$
The centers of the faces are $(\pm \frac{1}{3}, \pm \frac{1}{3}, \pm \frac{1}{3}).$
These are the vertices of the cube. The side length is $\frac{2}{3}.$

Consider a cube with side length $s.$ The centers of the faces are at distance $\frac{s}{2}$ from the center of the cube. The coordinates of the centers of the faces are $(\pm \frac{s}{2}, 0, 0), (0, \pm \frac{s}{2}, 0), (0, 0, \pm \frac{s}{2}).$ These are the vertices of the dual octahedron.
The edge length of this octahedron is $\sqrt{(\frac{s}{2})^2 + (\frac{s}{2})^2} = \sqrt{\frac{s^2}{4} + \frac{s^2}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{s^2}{2}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}.$

If the octahedron has edge length $a,$ the dual cube has side length $\frac{2a}{3}.$
Let the octahedron have edge length $a.$ Its volume is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} a^3.$
The centers of the faces form a cube with side length $\frac{a\sqrt{2}}{3}.$
Volume of the cube $= \left(\frac{a\sqrt{2}}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{2\sqrt{2} a^3}{27}.$

Ratio $\frac{V_O}{V_C} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} a^3}{\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{27} a^3} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \times \frac{27}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{9}{2}.$

Let's be careful with the definition of the cube $C.$
The vertices of the cube $C$ are the centers of the faces of $O.$

Let the regular octahedron $O$ have edge length $s.$
Volume of $O = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} s^3.$

Consider one face of the octahedron, an equilateral triangle with side length $s.$
The center of this face is the centroid.

Let the vertices of one face be $(x_1, y_1, z_1), (x_2, y_2, z_2), (x_3, y_3, z_3).$
Center $= \left(\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3}{3}, \frac{y_1+y_2+y_3}{3}, \frac{z_1+z_2+z_3}{3}\right).$

Consider the octahedron with vertices $(\pm a, 0, 0), (0, \pm a, 0), (0, 0, \pm a).$
The faces are equilateral triangles. Consider the face with vertices $(a, 0, 0), (0, a, 0), (0, 0, a).$
The side length of this triangle is $\sqrt{(a-0)^2 + (0-a)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \sqrt{a^2+a^2} = a\sqrt{2}.$
So, $s = a\sqrt{2},$ which means $a = \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}.$

The center of the face with vertices $(a, 0, 0), (0, a, 0), (0, 0, a)$ is $\left(\frac{a}{3}, \frac{a}{3}, \frac{a}{3}\right).$
Substituting $a = \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}},$ the center is $\left(\frac{s}{3\sqrt{2}}, \frac{s}{3\sqrt{2}}, \frac{s}{3\sqrt{2}}\right).$

The vertices of the cube $C$ are $\left(\pm \frac{s}{3\sqrt{2}}, \pm \frac{s}{3\sqrt{2}}, \pm \frac{s}{3\sqrt{2}}\right),$ with an odd number of minus signs.

Side length of the cube $C$: distance between $(\frac{s}{3\sqrt{2}}, \frac{s}{3\sqrt{2}}, \frac{s}{3\sqrt{2}})$ and $(-\frac{s}{3\sqrt{2}}, \frac{s}{3\sqrt{2}}, \frac{s}{3\sqrt{2}}).$
$= \sqrt{\left(\frac{2s}{3\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} = \frac{2s}{3\sqrt{2}} = \frac{s\sqrt{2}}{3}.$

Volume of the cube $C$: $V_C = \left(\frac{s\sqrt{2}}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{s^3 (2\sqrt{2})}{27}.$

Volume of the octahedron $O$: $V_O = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} s^3.$

Ratio $\frac{V_O}{V_C} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} s^3}{\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{27} s^3} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \times \frac{27}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{9}{2}.$

So, $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{9}{2}.$
$m = 9, n = 2.$
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
$m+n = 9+2 = 11.$

Final check of the argument and calculations.
The setup of the octahedron and the centers of its faces seems correct.
The calculation of the side length and volume of the cube $C$ seems correct.
The formula for the volume of a regular octahedron is correct.
The ratio calculation is correct.
The values of $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.

Consider a simpler case: a regular tetrahedron and the dual tetrahedron.
Vertices of a regular tetrahedron: $(a, a, a), (a, -a, -a), (-a, a, -a), (-a, -a, a).$
Faces are equilateral triangles.
Centers of the faces form another tetrahedron.
This might provide some intuition but is not directly related to the octahedron-cube duality.

The problem seems straightforward once the geometry is set up correctly. The key is finding the coordinates of the vertices of the cube $C.$
The choice of the regular octahedron centered at the origin with vertices on the axes simplifies the calculation of the centers of the faces.

Volume of $O = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} s^3.$

Consider one face of the octahedron, an equilateral triangle with side length $s.$
