Problem:
Freddy the frog is jumping around the coordinate plane searching for a river, which lies on the horizontal line $y = 24$ . A fence is located at the horizontal line $y = 0$ . On each jump Freddy randomly chooses a direction parallel to one of the coordinate axes and moves one unit in that direction. When he is at a point where $y=0$ , with equal likelihoods he chooses one of three directions where he either jumps parallel to the fence or jumps away from the fence, but he never chooses the direction that would have him cross over the fence to where $y < 0$ . Freddy starts his search at the point $(0, 21)$ and will stop once he reaches a point on the river. Find the expected number of jumps it will take Freddy to reach the river.

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the expected number of jumps Freddy takes to reach the river at $y=24$, starting from $(0, 21)$. The movement of Freddy depends on his current $y$-coordinate.

Let $E(x, y)$ be the expected number of jumps to reach the river from the point $(x, y)$. Due to the symmetry of the problem with respect to the $x$-coordinate, $E(x, y)$ does not depend on $x$, so we can write $E(y)$ instead of $E(x, y)$, where $y$ is the current $y$-coordinate of Freddy.

The river is at $y = 24$, so if Freddy reaches any point $(x, 24)$, he stops. This gives the boundary condition $E(24) = 0$.

The fence is at $y = 0$.

Consider the cases for Freddy's position:

Case 1: $0 < y < 24$
If Freddy is at $(x, y)$, where $0 < y < 24$, he can jump to $(x+1, y)$, $(x-1, y)$, $(x, y+1)$, or $(x, y-1)$ with equal probability $1/4$.
The expected number of jumps from $(x, y)$ is given by:
$E(y) = 1 + \frac{1}{4} E(y) + \frac{1}{4} E(y) + \frac{1}{4} E(y+1) + \frac{1}{4} E(y-1)$
$E(y) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E(y) + \frac{1}{4} E(y+1) + \frac{1}{4} E(y-1)$
$\frac{1}{2} E(y) = 1 + \frac{1}{4} E(y+1) + \frac{1}{4} E(y-1)$
$2 E(y) = 4 + E(y+1) + E(y-1)$
$E(y+1) - E(y) = E(y) - E(y-1) - 4$

Let $d(y) = E(y) - E(y-1)$. Then the equation becomes:
$d(y+1) = d(y) - 4$.
This is a linear recurrence relation for $d(y)$. The general solution is $d(y) = d(1) - 4(y-1)$.

We have $E(y) = E(0) + \sum_{i=1}^{y} d(i) = E(0) + \sum_{i=1}^{y} (d(1) - 4(i-1))$
$E(y) = E(0) + y d(1) - 4 \sum_{i=1}^{y} (i-1) = E(0) + y d(1) - 4 \sum_{j=0}^{y-1} j$
$E(y) = E(0) + y d(1) - 4 \frac{(y-1)y}{2} = E(0) + y d(1) - 2y(y-1)$
$E(y) = E(0) + y d(1) - 2y^2 + 2y$

Case 2: $y = 0$
If Freddy is at $(x, 0)$, he can jump to $(x+1, 0)$, $(x-1, 0)$, or $(x, 1)$ with equal probability $1/3$.
The expected number of jumps from $(x, 0)$ is:
$E(0) = 1 + \frac{1}{3} E(0) + \frac{1}{3} E(0) + \frac{1}{3} E(1)$
$E(0) = 1 + \frac{2}{3} E(0) + \frac{1}{3} E(1)$
$\frac{1}{3} E(0) = 1 + \frac{1}{3} E(1)$
$E(0) = 3 + E(1)$

Now we can use the expression for $E(y)$ with $y=1$:
$E(1) = E(0) + 1 \cdot d(1) - 2(1)^2 + 2(1) = E(0) + d(1) - 2 + 2 = E(0) + d(1)$
From $E(0) = 3 + E(1)$, we have $E(0) = 3 + E(0) + d(1)$, which gives $d(1) = -3$.

Substitute $d(1) = -3$ into the expression for $d(y)$:
$d(y) = -3 - 4(y-1) = -3 - 4y + 4 = 1 - 4y$.

Substitute $d(1) = -3$ into the expression for $E(y)$:
$E(y) = E(0) + y(-3) - 2y^2 + 2y = E(0) - 3y - 2y^2 + 2y = E(0) - y - 2y^2$.

We need to find $E(0)$. We can use the boundary condition at the river, $E(24) = 0$.
$E(24) = E(0) - 24 - 2(24)^2 = 0$
$E(0) = 24 + 2(576) = 24 + 1152 = 1176$.

Now we have the expression for $E(y)$:
$E(y) = 1176 - y - 2y^2$, for $0 \le y \le 24$.

We need to find the expected number of jumps starting from $(0, 21)$, which is $E(21)$.
$E(21) = 1176 - 21 - 2(21)^2 = 1176 - 21 - 2(441) = 1176 - 21 - 882 = 1155 - 882 = 273$.

Let's double-check the calculations.

Consider the edge cases and the setup again.
The problem can be modeled as a 1D random walk on the y-axis with boundaries.

Let $e_y$ be the expected number of steps to reach $y=24$ starting from height $y$.
We have the boundary condition $e_{24} = 0$.

For $0 < y < 24$:
$e_y = 1 + \frac{1}{4} e_{y+1} + \frac{1}{4} e_{y-1} + \frac{1}{4} e_y + \frac{1}{4} e_y$
$e_y = 1 + \frac{1}{2} e_y + \frac{1}{4} e_{y+1} + \frac{1}{4} e_{y-1}$
$\frac{1}{2} e_y = 1 + \frac{1}{4} e_{y+1} + \frac{1}{4} e_{y-1}$
$2 e_y = 4 + e_{y+1} + e_{y-1}$
$e_{y+1} - e_y = e_y - e_{y-1} - 4$

For $y = 0$:
$e_0 = 1 + \frac{1}{3} e_1 + \frac{1}{3} e_0 + \frac{1}{3} e_0$
$e_0 = 1 + \frac{1}{3} e_1 + \frac{2}{3} e_0$
$\frac{1}{3} e_0 = 1 + \frac{1}{3} e_1$
$e_0 = 3 + e_1$

Let $\Delta_y = e_y - e_{y-1}$.
$\Delta_{y+1} = \Delta_y - 4$.
$\Delta_y = \Delta_1 - 4(y-1)$.

$e_y = e_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{y} \Delta_i = e_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{y} (\Delta_1 - 4(i-1))$
$e_y = e_0 + y \Delta_1 - 4 \frac{y(y-1)}{2} = e_0 + y \Delta_1 - 2y(y-1)$

From $e_0 = 3 + e_1$, we have $e_0 - e_1 = 3$, so $-\Delta_1 = 3$, which means $\Delta_1 = -3$.

Substitute $\Delta_1 = -3$:
$e_y = e_0 + y(-3) - 2y^2 + 2y = e_0 - 3y - 2y^2 + 2y = e_0 - y - 2y^2$.

Using the boundary condition $e_{24} = 0$:
$e_{24} = e_0 - 24 - 2(24)^2 = 0$
$e_0 = 24 + 2 \cdot 576 = 24 + 1152 = 1176$.

So, $e_y = 1176 - y - 2y^2$.

The starting position is $y = 21$.
The expected number of jumps from $y = 21$ is $e_{21}$.
$e_{21} = 1176 - 21 - 2(21)^2 = 1176 - 21 - 2(441) = 1176 - 21 - 882 = 1155 - 882 = 273$.

Alternative approach: Define the expected number of steps to reach the river starting from a given y-coordinate.
Let $E_y$ be the expected number of jumps to reach $y=24$ starting from height $y$.

For $0 < y < 24$:
$E_y = 1 + \frac{1}{4} E_{y+1} + \frac{1}{4} E_{y-1} + \frac{1}{4} E_y + \frac{1}{4} E_y$
$2 E_y = 4 + E_{y+1} + E_{y-1}$

For $y = 0$:
$E_0 = 1 + \frac{1}{3} E_1 + \frac{1}{3} E_0 + \frac{1}{3} E_0$
$E_0 = 1 + \frac{1}{3} E_1 + \frac{2}{3} E_0$
$\frac{1}{3} E_0 = 1 + \frac{1}{3} E_1 \implies E_0 = 3 + E_1$.

Boundary condition: $E_{24} = 0$.

Consider the homogeneous part of the recurrence relation for $0 < y < 24$:
$2 E_y = E_{y+1} + E_{y-1}$
$E_{y+1} - E_y = E_y - E_{y-1}$
This means the homogeneous solution is of the form $A y + B$.

For the particular solution, assume $E_y = C y^2$.
$2 C y^2 = C (y+1)^2 + C (y-1)^2 + 4$
$2 C y^2 = C (y^2 + 2y + 1) + C (y^2 - 2y + 1) + 4$
$2 C y^2 = C y^2 + 2 C y + C + C y^2 - 2 C y + C + 4$
$2 C y^2 = 2 C y^2 + 2 C + 4$
$0 = 2 C + 4 \implies C = -2$.
So, a particular solution is $-2 y^2$.

The general solution for $0 \le y \le 24$ is $E_y = A y + B - 2 y^2$.

Using the boundary condition $E_{24} = 0$:
$0 = 24 A + B - 2 (24)^2 = 24 A + B - 1152$.
$24 A + B = 1152$.

Using the relation at the boundary $y=0$:
$E_0 = 3 + E_1$
$B = 3 + (A + B - 2)$
$B = 1 + A + B$
$0 = 1 + A \implies A = -1$.

Substitute $A = -1$ into $24 A + B = 1152$:
$24 (-1) + B = 1152$
$-24 + B = 1152$
$B = 1152 + 24 = 1176$.

So, the solution is $E_y = -y + 1176 - 2 y^2 = 1176 - y - 2 y^2$.
This matches the previous result.

The starting position is $y = 21$.
$E_{21} = 1176 - 21 - 2 (21)^2 = 1176 - 21 - 882 = 273$.

Consider a simpler case: no fence, starting at $y=23$.
$E_{23} = 1 + \frac{1}{4} E_{24} + \frac{1}{4} E_{22} + \frac{1}{4} E_{23} + \frac{1}{4} E_{23}$
$E_{23} = 1 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} E_{22} + \frac{1}{2} E_{23}$
$\frac{1}{2} E_{23} = 1 + \frac{1}{4} E_{22}$
$2 E_{23} = 4 + E_{22}$
$2 E_{23} = 4 + (1176 - 22 - 2 \cdot 22^2) = 4 + 1176 - 22 - 968 = 1180 - 22 - 968 = 1158 - 968 = 190$.
$E_{23} = 95$.

Using the formula $E_y = 1176 - y - 2 y^2$:
$E_{23} = 1176 - 23 - 2 (23)^2 = 1176 - 23 - 2 (529) = 1176 - 23 - 1058 = 1153 - 1058 = 95$.
Matches.

Consider starting at $y=1$.
$E_1 = 1176 - 1 - 2 (1)^2 = 1176 - 1 - 2 = 1173$.

From the recurrence relation:
$2 E_1 = 4 + E_2 + E_0$
$2 E_1 = 4 + (1176 - 2 - 8) + 1176 = 4 + 1166 + 1176 = 1170 + 1176 = 2346$.
$E_1 = 1173$. Matches.

Consider starting at $y=0$.
$E_0 = 1176 - 0 - 2 (0)^2 = 1176$.

Using the relation at $y=0$:
$E_0 = 3 + E_1 = 3 + 1173 = 1176$. Matches.

The problem seems straightforward once the setup for expected values is done correctly. The key is handling the boundary conditions at the fence and the river. The symmetry allows us to reduce the problem to one dimension.

The movement rule at $y=0$ ensures that the frog stays on or above the fence.

Final check of the question details:
- River at $y = 24$.
- Fence at $y = 0$.
- Movement at $y > 0$: equal likelihood of $\pm 1$ in x or y.
- Movement at $y = 0$: equal likelihood of $(+1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1)$.
- Start at $(0, 21)$.
- Stop when reaches the river.

The expected number of jumps depends only on the y-coordinate, due to symmetry.

The recurrence relations derived capture the expected number of steps to absorption (reaching the river).
The boundary conditions at the absorbing state (river) and the reflecting barrier (fence) are crucial.

Consider the possibility of never reaching the river. However, with positive probability of moving towards the river at each step, and the river being at a finite distance, the probability of reaching the river is 1.

The expected number of steps for a 1D random walk to reach a boundary can be found using similar methods.
The drift in the random walk is zero in the bulk, but the boundary conditions introduce asymmetry.
