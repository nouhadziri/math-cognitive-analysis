Problem:
Let \[T=\{(tq,1-t) \in\mathbb R^{2}| t \in [0,1],q\in\mathbb Q\}\]Prove that each continuous function  $f: T\longrightarrow T$  has a fixed point.

Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
To prove that each continuous function \( f: T \longrightarrow T \) has a fixed point, we will use a combination of topological arguments and fixed point theorems. Let's break down the solution step by step.

1. **Define the Set \( T \)**:
   \[
   T = \{(tq, 1-t) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid t \in [0,1], q \in \mathbb{Q}\}
   \]
   This set consists of points in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) where the first coordinate is a rational multiple of \( t \) and the second coordinate is \( 1-t \).

2. **Introduce a New Topology**:
   Define a new topology on \( T \) with a basis consisting of open intervals on each of the segments (excluding the point \((0,1)\)) and the usual open basis around the point \((0,1)\) induced by the usual topology of \(\mathbb{R}^2\). This topology is finer than the usual topology induced on \( T \) by \(\mathbb{R}^2\).

3. **Topological Spaces**:
   Let \((T, A)\) be the topology on \( T \) induced by the usual topology of \(\mathbb{R}^2\), and \((T, B)\) be the new topology introduced above.

4. **Continuity in Different Topologies**:
   If \( f: (T, A) \to (T, A) \) is a continuous function, then \( f: (T, B) \to (T, B) \) is also continuous. This follows because the topology \( B \) is finer than \( A \).

5. **Fixed Point Argument**:
   Consider the point \((0,1)\). If \( f((0,1)) = (0,1) \), then \((0,1)\) is a fixed point. If not, then \( f((0,1)) \in I \setminus \{(0,1)\} \), where
   \[
   I = \{(qt, 1-t) \mid t \in [0,1], q \in \mathbb{Q}\}
   \]
   for some \( q \in \mathbb{Q} \).

6. **Fixed Point in Subsets**:
   We claim that \( f_{|I} \) has a fixed point in \( I \). This can be shown using the fact that if a topological space is the union of two subsets \( U \) and \( V \) such that \(\bar{U} \cap V = U \cap \bar{V} = U \cap V = \{\text{a point}\}\), and if these two sets with the induced topology have the fixed point property, then their union (the original topological space) also has the fixed point property.

7. **Conclusion**:
   By the above argument, every continuous function \( f: T \to T \) must have a fixed point.
