Problem:
Rectangle $ABCD_{}^{}$ has sides $\overline {AB}$ of length 4 and $\overline {CB}$ of length 3. Divide $\overline {AB}$ into 168 congruent segments with points $A_{}^{}=P_0, P_1, \ldots, P_{168}=B$ , and divide $\overline {CB}$ into 168 congruent segments with points $C_{}^{}=Q_0, Q_1, \ldots, Q_{168}=B$ . For $1_{}^{} \le k \le 167$ , draw the segments $\overline {P_kQ_k}$ . Repeat this construction on the sides $\overline {AD}$ and $\overline {CD}$ , and then draw the diagonal $\overline {AC}$ . Find the sum of the lengths of the 335 parallel segments drawn.

Analysis:
I notice that the thinking trajectory provided is extremely brief - just the answer "840" without any solution steps. This doesn't give me much to analyze in terms of cognitive skills. However, I can infer what skills would be needed to solve this problem and reach this answer.

<text>840</text>
<explanation>To solve this problem efficiently, the solver would need to recognize the pattern formed by the 335 parallel segments and understand how their lengths relate to each other, rather than calculating each segment individually.</explanation>
