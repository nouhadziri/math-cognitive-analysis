Problem:
Given vertically polarized light, you're given the task of changing it to horizontally polarized light by passing it through a series of $N=5$ linear polarizers. What is the maximum possible efficiency of this process? (Here, efficiency is defined as the ratio between output light intensity and input light intensity.)

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Let $\theta_{0}=0$ be the original direction of polarization and $\theta_{5}=\pi / 2$ the final direction of polarization. The 5 polarizers are directed along $\theta_{1}, \theta_{2}, \ldots, \theta_{5}$. Let $\delta_{k}=\theta_{k}-\theta_{k-1}$, so that the efficiency is

$$
\eta=\prod_{k=1}^{5} \cos ^{2} \delta_{k}
$$

We wish to maximize $\eta$ subject to the constraint that $\sum_{k} \delta_{k}=\pi / 2$. Clearly, the $\delta_{k}^{\prime} s$ should be non-negative, implying that $0 \leq \delta_{k} \leq \pi / 2$ and thus $\cos \delta_{k} \geq 0$ for all $k$.



We claim that the maximum is achieved when all $\delta_{k}$ are equal. If not, let $\delta_{i} \neq \delta_{i+1}$. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
\cos \delta_{i} \cos \delta_{i+1} & =\frac{1}{2}\left[\cos \left(\delta_{i}+\delta_{i+1}\right)+\cos \left(\delta_{i}-\delta_{i+1}\right)\right] \\
& <\frac{1}{2}\left[\cos \left(\delta_{i}+\delta_{i+1}\right)+1\right] \\
& =\frac{1}{2}\left[\cos \left(\delta_{i}^{\prime}+\delta_{i+1}^{\prime}\right)+\cos \left(\delta_{i}^{\prime}-\delta_{i+1}^{\prime}\right)\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\delta_{i}^{\prime}=\delta_{i+1}^{\prime}=\frac{\delta_{i}+\delta_{i+1}}{2}$. So replacing $\delta_{i}, \delta_{i+1}$ with $\delta_{i}^{\prime}, \delta_{i+1}^{\prime}$ increases $\eta$.

So $\eta$ is maximized when all $\delta_{k}$ are equal, i.e., $\delta_{k}^{*}=\frac{\pi}{10}$ for all $k$. Then

$$
\eta^{*}=\cos ^{10}\left(\frac{\pi}{10}\right) \approx 0.6054
$$

</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the product-to-sum trigonometric identity for cosines (cos A × cos B = ½[cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)]) to transform the product into a more analyzable form. This demonstrates knowledge and appropriate application of trigonometric identities.</explanation>

<end>1057</end>
<text>So $\eta$ is maximized when all $\delta_{k}$ are equal, i.e., $\delta_{k}^{*}=\frac{\pi}{10}$ for all $k$.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that the symmetric solution (all angles being equal) maximizes the efficiency. This insight comes from understanding the mathematical structure of the problem and the properties of the cosine function. They calculate the specific value of each angle by dividing the total angle (π/2) by the number of gaps between polarizers (5).</explanation>
