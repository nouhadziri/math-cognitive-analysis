Problem:
FemtoPravis is walking on an $8 \times 8$ chessboard that wraps around at its edges (so squares on the left edge of the chessboard are adjacent to squares on the right edge, and similarly for the top and bottom edges). Each femtosecond, FemtoPravis moves in one of the four diagonal directions uniformly at random. After 2012 femtoseconds, what is the probability that FemtoPravis is at his original location?

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the probability that FemtoPravis returns to the starting position after 2012 steps on an $8 \times 8$ toroidal chessboard. The movement is restricted to diagonal steps.

The chessboard can be represented by coordinates $(x, y)$ where $1 \le x, y \le 8$. The toroidal nature means that if we are at $(x, y)$, the adjacent squares are $((x \pm 1 \mod 8), (y \pm 1 \mod 8))$, where the modulo operation results in values from 1 to 8.

Let the position of FemtoPravis at time $t$ be $(X_t, Y_t)$. The starting position is $(X_0, Y_0)$. We want to find the probability $P((X_{2012}, Y_{2012}) = (X_0, Y_0))$.

The possible moves from a square $(x, y)$ are to $(x+1, y+1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y+1), (x-1, y-1)$, with coordinates taken modulo 8. Let the change in coordinates at each step be $(\Delta x, \Delta y)$, where $\Delta x, \Delta y \in \{-1, 1\}$.

The four possible moves correspond to $(\Delta x, \Delta y) \in \{(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)\}$. Each move occurs with probability $\frac{1}{4}$.

Let the sequence of moves be $(\Delta x_1, \Delta y_1), (\Delta x_2, \Delta y_2), \dots, (\Delta x_{2012}, \Delta y_{2012})$.
The position after $n$ steps is $(X_n, Y_n) = (X_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta x_i, Y_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta y_i)$, where the additions are modulo 8.

We want the probability that $X_{2012} \equiv X_0 \pmod{8}$ and $Y_{2012} \equiv Y_0 \pmod{8}$.
This means $\sum_{i=1}^{2012} \Delta x_i \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{2012} \Delta y_i \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$.

Let $n_{++}$ be the number of moves of type $(1, 1)$, $n_{+-}$ be the number of moves of type $(1, -1)$, $n_{-+}$ be the number of moves of type $(-1, 1)$, and $n_{--}$ be the number of moves of type $(-1, -1)$.
We have $n_{++} + n_{+-} + n_{-+} + n_{--} = 2012$.

The total change in $x$ is $\Delta X = (n_{++} + n_{+-} - n_{-+} - n_{--})$.
The total change in $y$ is $\Delta Y = (n_{++} - n_{+-} + n_{-+} - n_{--})$.

We need $\Delta X \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$ and $\Delta Y \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$.

Consider the random variables representing the change in coordinates at each step. Let $(\delta x_i, \delta y_i)$ be the change at step $i$.
$P((\delta x_i, \delta y_i) = (1, 1)) = 1/4$
$P((\delta x_i, \delta y_i) = (1, -1)) = 1/4$
$P((\delta x_i, \delta y_i) = (-1, 1)) = 1/4$
$P((\delta x_i, \delta y_i) = (-1, -1)) = 1/4$

Let $S_x = \sum_{i=1}^{2012} \delta x_i$ and $S_y = \sum_{i=1}^{2012} \delta y_i$. We want $P(S_x \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \text{ and } S_y \equiv 0 \pmod{8})$.

Consider the random walk on the integers for the $x$ and $y$ coordinates separately.
The change in $x$ at each step is either $1$ or $-1$.
$P(\delta x_i = 1) = P(\text{move right}) = P((1, 1) \text{ or } (1, -1)) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$.
$P(\delta x_i = -1) = P(\text{move left}) = P((-1, 1) \text{ or } (-1, -1)) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$.

The change in $y$ at each step is either $1$ or $-1$.
$P(\delta y_i = 1) = P(\text{move up}) = P((1, 1) \text{ or } (-1, 1)) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$.
$P(\delta y_i = -1) = P(\text{move down}) = P((1, -1) \text{ or } (-1, -1)) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$.

So, $S_x$ is the sum of 2012 independent random variables, each taking values $1$ or $-1$ with probability $1/2$.
Similarly for $S_y$.

Let $n_r$ be the number of steps where $\delta x_i = 1$, and $n_l$ be the number of steps where $\delta x_i = -1$.
$n_r + n_l = 2012$.
$S_x = n_r - n_l = n_r - (2012 - n_r) = 2n_r - 2012$.
We need $2n_r - 2012 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$, so $2n_r \equiv 2012 \pmod{8}$.
$2012 = 2000 + 12 = 8 \times 250 + 8 + 4$, so $2012 \equiv 4 \pmod{8}$.
$2n_r \equiv 4 \pmod{8}$.
Dividing by 2, $n_r \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$.
So, $n_r$ can be $2, 6, 10, \dots$.

Similarly, let $n_u$ be the number of steps where $\delta y_i = 1$, and $n_d$ be the number of steps where $\delta y_i = -1$.
$n_u + n_d = 2012$.
$S_y = n_u - n_d = 2n_u - 2012$.
We need $2n_u - 2012 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$, so $2n_u \equiv 4 \pmod{8}$, which means $n_u \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$.

The number of ways to have $n_r$ steps with $\delta x = 1$ in 2012 steps is $\binom{2012}{n_r}$.
The probability of having $n_r$ such steps is $\binom{2012}{n_r} (1/2)^{n_r} (1/2)^{2012 - n_r} = \binom{2012}{n_r} (1/2)^{2012}$.
We need to sum this over $n_r$ such that $n_r \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$.

Consider the expansion of $(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k y^{n-k}$.
$(1+1)^{2012} = \sum_{k=0}^{2012} \binom{2012}{k}$
$(1-1)^{2012} = 0 = \sum_{k=0}^{2012} \binom{2012}{k} (-1)^k$
$(1+i)^{2012} = \sum_{k=0}^{2012} \binom{2012}{k} i^k$
$(1-i)^{2012} = \sum_{k=0}^{2012} \binom{2012}{k} (-i)^k$

Sum of $\binom{n}{k}$ where $k \equiv r \pmod{m}$.
Let $\omega = e^{2\pi i / m}$.
$\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \omega^{-rj} (1+\omega^j)^n = \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \omega^{-rj} \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \omega^{jk} = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \omega^{j(k-r)}$
The inner sum is $m$ if $k-r \equiv 0 \pmod{m}$, and $0$ otherwise.
So, $\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \omega^{-rj} (1+\omega^j)^n = m \sum_{k \equiv r \pmod{m}} \binom{n}{k}$.

We need $n_r \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$. Here $m=4, r=2$.
$\omega = e^{2\pi i / 4} = i$.
$\sum_{j=0}^{3} i^{-2j} (1+i^j)^{2012} = 4 \sum_{n_r \equiv 2 \pmod{4}} \binom{2012}{n_r}$.

$j=0: i^0 (1+1)^{2012} = 1 \cdot 2^{2012}$
$j=1: i^{-2} (1+i)^{2012} = -1 \cdot (1+i)^{2012}$
$j=2: i^{-4} (1+i^2)^{2012} = 1 \cdot (1-1)^{2012} = 0$
$j=3: i^{-6} (1+i^3)^{2012} = -1 \cdot (1-i)^{2012}$

Sum $= 2^{2012} - (1+i)^{2012} - (1-i)^{2012}$.
$1+i = \sqrt{2} e^{i \pi/4}$, so $(1+i)^{2012} = (\sqrt{2})^{2012} e^{i 2012 \pi/4} = 2^{1006} e^{i 503 \pi} = 2^{1006} (\cos(503\pi) + i \sin(503\pi)) = 2^{1006} (-1 + 0i) = -2^{1006}$.
$1-i = \sqrt{2} e^{-i \pi/4}$, so $(1-i)^{2012} = (\sqrt{2})^{2012} e^{-i 2012 \pi/4} = 2^{1006} e^{-i 503 \pi} = 2^{1006} (\cos(-503\pi) + i \sin(-503\pi)) = 2^{1006} (-1 + 0i) = -2^{1006}$.

Sum $= 2^{2012} - (-2^{1006}) - (-2^{1006}) = 2^{2012} + 2 \cdot 2^{1006}$.
$4 \sum_{n_r \equiv 2 \pmod{4}} \binom{2012}{n_r} = 2^{2012} + 2^{1007}$.
$\sum_{n_r \equiv 2 \pmod{4}} \binom{2012}{n_r} = \frac{2^{2012} + 2^{1007}}{4} = 2^{2010} + 2^{1005}$.

Probability $P(S_x \equiv 0 \pmod{8}) = (2^{2010} + 2^{1005}) / 2^{2012} = 1/4 + 1/2^{1007}$.

Similarly, $P(S_y \equiv 0 \pmod{8}) = 1/4 + 1/2^{1007}$.

Since the movements in $x$ and $y$ directions are independent,
$P(S_x \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \text{ and } S_y \equiv 0 \pmod{8}) = P(S_x \equiv 0 \pmod{8}) P(S_y \equiv 0 \pmod{8})$
$= (1/4 + 1/2^{1007}) (1/4 + 1/2^{1007})$
$= 1/16 + 2 \cdot (1/4) \cdot (1/2^{1007}) + (1/2^{1007})^2$
$= 1/16 + 1/2^{1008} + 1/2^{2014}$.

Let's re-think the problem using the structure of the moves.
The change in position at each step is one of $(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)$.

Let the position at time $t$ be $(x_t, y_t)$.
$x_{t+1} = x_t + \delta x_{t+1} \pmod{8}$
$y_{t+1} = y_t + \delta y_{t+1} \pmod{8}$

After 2012 steps, we need $x_{2012} \equiv x_0 \pmod{8}$ and $y_{2012} \equiv y_0 \pmod{8}$.
This means $\sum_{i=1}^{2012} \delta x_i \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{2012} \delta y_i \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$.

Consider the vector of changes $(\Delta x, \Delta y)$ at each step.
Possible values are $(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)$.
Let $n_{++}, n_{+-}, n_{-+}, n_{--}$ be the number of occurrences of each type of move.
Sum of changes in $x$: $n_{++} + n_{+-} - n_{-+} - n_{--} \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$
Sum of changes in $y$: $n_{++} - n_{+-} + n_{-+} - n_{--} \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$

Adding the two congruences: $2n_{++} - 2n_{--} \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$, so $n_{++} - n_{--} \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$.
Subtracting the two congruences: $2n_{+-} - 2n_{-+} \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$, so $n_{+-} - n_{-+} \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$.

We also have $n_{++} + n_{+-} + n_{-+} + n_{--} = 2012$.

Let $N = 2012$. We are looking for the number of solutions to:
$n_{++} - n_{--} = 4k_1$
$n_{+-} - n_{-+} = 4k_2$
$n_{++} + n_{+-} + n_{-+} + n_{--} = N$
where $n_{++}, n_{+-}, n_{-+}, n_{--} \ge 0$.

Consider the movement in terms of parity.
Change in $x+y$ is $\delta x + \delta y \in \{2, 0, 0, -2\}$. Always even.
Change in $x-y$ is $\delta x - \delta y \in \{0, 2, -2, 0\}$. Always even.

Consider the movement on the transformed coordinates $u = x+y$ and $v = x-y$.
The moves correspond to changes in $(u, v)$:
$(1, 1) \implies \Delta u = 2, \Delta v = 0$
$(1, -1) \implies \Delta u = 0, \Delta v = 2$
$(-1, 1) \implies \Delta u = 0, \Delta v = -2$
$(-1, -1) \implies \Delta u = -2, \Delta v = 0$

We need the final change in $u$ and $v$ to be multiples of 8.
$\Delta U = 2n_{++} - 2n_{--} = 2(n_{++} - n_{--})$
$\Delta V = 2n_{+-} - 2n_{-+} = 2(n_{+-} - n_{-+})$

We need $\Delta U \equiv 0 \pmod{16}$ and $\Delta V \equiv 0 \pmod{16}$.
$2(n_{++} - n_{--}) \equiv 0 \pmod{16} \implies n_{++} - n_{--} \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$
$2(n_{+-} - n_{-+}) \equiv 0 \pmod{16} \implies n_{+-} - n_{-+} \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$

Let $X_i, Y_i$ be the changes in $x$ and $y$ at step $i$.
$E[X_i] = 1/2 \cdot 1 + 1/2 \cdot (-1) = 0$.
$E[Y_i] = 1/2 \cdot 1 + 1/2 \cdot (-1) = 0$.

Consider the generating function for a single step:
$\frac{1}{4} z_x^1 z_y^1 + \frac{1}{4} z_x^1 z_y^{-1} + \frac{1}{4} z_x^{-1} z_y^1 + \frac{1}{4} z_x^{-1} z_y^{-1} = \frac{1}{4} (z_x + z_x^{-1})(z_y + z_y^{-1})$.

After 2012 steps, the coefficient of $z_x^a z_y^b$ in $[\frac{1}{4} (z_x + z_x^{-1})(z_y + z_y^{-1})]^{2012}$ gives the probability of a net change of $(a, b)$.
We need the coefficient of $z_x^0 z_y^0$.

$[\frac{1}{4} (z_x + z_x^{-1})(z_y + z_y^{-1})]^{2012} = (\frac{1}{4})^{2012} (z_x + z_x^{-1})^{2012} (z_y + z_y^{-1})^{2012}$.
Coefficient of $z_x^0$ in $(z_x + z_x^{-1})^{2012}$: term with $z_x^{1006} z_x^{-1006}$, which is $\binom{2012}{1006}$.
Coefficient of $z_y^0$ in $(z_y + z_y^{-1})^{2012}$: $\binom{2012}{1006}$.

Probability of net change $(0, 0)$ on infinite grid is $(\frac{1}{4})^{2012} \binom{2012}{1006}^2$.

Now, consider the modulo 8.
We need the number of paths of length 2012 such that the net change in $x$ is a multiple of 8, and net change in $y$ is a multiple of 8.

Let the change at step $i$ be $(\delta x_i, \delta y_i)$.
Consider the characteristic function approach.
Let $\theta_x, \theta_y \in [0, 2\pi)$.
$E[e^{i (\theta_x \Delta x + \theta_y \Delta y)}] = \frac{1}{4} (e^{i(\theta_x + \theta_y)} + e^{i(\theta_x - \theta_y)} + e^{i(-\theta_x + \theta_y)} + e^{i(-\theta_x - \theta_y)})$
$= \frac{1}{4} (e^{i\theta_x} e^{i\theta_y} + e^{i\theta_x} e^{-i\theta_y} + e^{-i\theta_x} e^{i\theta_y} + e^{-i\theta_x} e^{-i\theta_y})$
$= \frac{1}{4} (e^{i\theta_x} + e^{-i\theta_x}) (e^{i\theta_y} + e^{-i\theta_y}) = \cos(\theta_x) \cos(\theta_y)$.

The probability that the final position is $(0, 0) \pmod{8}$ is
$\frac{1}{64} \sum_{j_x=0}^7 \sum_{j_y=0}^7 (E[e^{i \frac{2\pi}{8} (j_x S_x + j_y S_y)}])^{2012}$
where $S_x = \sum \delta x_i$, $S_y = \sum \delta y_i$.
$E[e^{i \frac{2\pi}{8} (j_x \delta x + j_y \delta y)}] = \cos(\frac{\pi j_x}{4}) \cos(\frac{\pi j_y}{4})$.

Probability = $\frac{1}{64} \sum_{j_x=0}^7 \sum_{j_y=0}^7 (\cos(\frac{\pi j_x}{4}) \cos(\frac{\pi j_y}{4}))^{2012}$.
Terms with $j_x, j_y = 0$: $(1 \cdot 1)^{2012} = 1$.
Terms with $j_x = 0, j_y \ne 0$: $(1 \cdot \cos(\frac{\pi j_y}{4}))^{2012}$.
Terms with $j_x \ne 0, j_y = 0$: $(\cos(\frac{\pi j_x}{4}) \cdot 1)^{2012}$.
Terms with $j_x \ne 0, j_y \ne 0$: $(\cos(\frac{\pi j_x}{4}) \cos(\frac{\pi j_y}{4}))^{2012}$.

Values of $\cos(\frac{\pi j}{4})$ for $j=0, \dots, 7$: $1, 1/\sqrt{2}, 0, -1/\sqrt{2}, -1, -1/\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/\sqrt{2}$.
Squares: $1, 1/2, 0, 1/2, 1, 1/2, 0, 1/2$.

Consider the sum.
Term for $j_x=0, j_y=0$ is 1.
Terms for $j_x=0, j_y \in \{1, 7\}$: $(1/\sqrt{2})^{2012} = (1/2)^{1006}$. (2 terms)
Terms for $j_x=0, j_y \in \{3, 5\}$: $(-1/\sqrt{2})^{2012} = (1/2)^{1006}$. (2 terms)
Term for $j_x=0, j_y = 2, 6$: $0^{2012} = 0$. (2 terms)
Term for $j_x=0, j_y = 4$: $(-1)^{2012} = 1$. (1 term)

Sum over $j_y$ for $j_x=0$: $1 + 2 (1/2)^{1006} + 2 (1/2)^{1006} + 0 + 1 = 2 + 4 \cdot (1/2)^{1006} = 2 + 2^{2-1006} = 2 + 2^{-1004}$.

The sum is $\left( 2 + 2^{-1004} \right)^2 = 4 + 4 \cdot 2^{-1004} + 2^{-2008} = 4 + 2^{-1002} + 2^{-2008}$.
Probability = $\frac{1}{64} (4 + 2^{-1002} + 2^{-2008}) = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{64} 2^{-1002} + \frac{1}{64} 2^{-2008}$
$= \frac{1}{16} + 2^{-6} 2^{-1002} + 2^{-6} 2^{-2008} = \frac{1}{16} + 2^{-1008} + 2^{-2014}$.

Something is wrong, previous result was different.

$P(S_x \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \text{ and } S_y \equiv 0 \pmod{8}) = P(S_x \equiv 0 \pmod{8}) P(S_y \equiv 0 \pmod{8})$</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the principle of independence in probability theory to multiply the probabilities of two separate events, demonstrating sophisticated probabilistic reasoning.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Approach Selection</skill>
<definition>The ability to evaluate and select appropriate mathematical techniques or approaches for solving a problem, often involving switching strategies when one approach proves difficult or inefficient.</definition>

<start>3989</start>
<end>4094</end>
<text>Let's re-think the problem using the structure of the moves.
The change in position at each step is one of $(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)$.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates the ability to step back, evaluate their current approach, and decide to try a different strategy that might be more effective, showing flexibility in problem-solving.</explanation>

<start>5613</start>
<end>5764</end>
<text>Consider the generating function for a single step:
$\frac{1}{4} z_x^1 z_y^1 + \frac{1}{4} z_x^1 z_y^{-1} + \frac{1}{4} z_x^{-1} z_y^1 + \frac{1}{4} z_x^{-1} z_y^{-1} = \frac{1}{4} (z_x + z_x^{-1})(z_y + z_y^{-1})$.</text>
<explanation>After trying several approaches, the solver switches to using generating functions, a powerful technique in combinatorial probability, showing their ability to select specialized mathematical tools appropriate for the problem.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Transformation</skill>
<definition>The ability to convert a problem from one mathematical form to another equivalent form that is easier to solve or analyze.</definition>

<start>4727</start>
<end>5036</end>
<text>The moves correspond to changes in $(u, v)$:
$(1, 1) \implies \Delta u = 2, \Delta v = 0$
$(1, -1) \implies \Delta u = 0, \Delta v = 2$
$(-1, 1) \implies \Delta u = 0, \Delta v = -2$
$(-1, -1) \implies \Delta u = -2, \Delta v = 0$

We need the final change in $u$ and $v$ to be multiples of 8.
$\Delta U = 2n_{++} - 2n_{--} = 2(n_{++} - n_{--})$
$\Delta V = 2n_{+-} - 2n_{-+} = 2(n_{+-} - n_{-+})$</text>
<explanation>The solver transforms the problem from the original (x,y) coordinate system to a (u,v) coordinate system where u=x+y and v=x-y. This transformation simplifies the analysis of the diagonal movements, making the pattern of changes clearer.</explanation>

<start>6314</start>
<end>6656</end>
<text>Let the change at step $i$ be $(\delta x_i, \delta y_i)$.
Consider the characteristic function approach.
Let $\theta_x, \theta_y \in [0, 2\pi)$.
$E[e^{i (\theta_x \Delta x + \theta_y \Delta y)}] = \frac{1}{4} (e^{i(\theta_x + \theta_y)} + e^{i(\theta_x - \theta_y)} + e^{i(-\theta_x + \theta_y)} + e^{i(-\theta_x - \theta_y)})$</text>
<explanation>The solver transforms the problem into the domain of characteristic functions (Fourier analysis), using complex exponentials to represent the probability distribution. This is a sophisticated mathematical transformation that leverages powerful analytical tools.</explanation>

<skill>Error Detection and Correction</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify inconsistencies or errors in one's reasoning and take steps to correct them, often involving retracing steps or reconsidering assumptions.</definition>

<start>7614</start>
<end>7660</end>
<text>Something is wrong, previous result was different.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes a discrepancy between two different approaches to the same problem, demonstrating awareness of potential errors and the need to reconcile conflicting results.</explanation>

<start>6657</start>
<end>6929</end>
<text>$= \frac{1}{4} (e^{i\theta_x} e^{i\theta_y} + e^{i\theta_x} e^{-i\theta_y} + e^{-i\theta_x} e^{i\theta_y} + e^{-i\theta_x} e^{-i\theta_y})$
$= \frac{1}{4} (e^{i\theta_x} + e^{-i\theta_x}) (e^{i\theta_y} + e^{-i\theta_y}) = \cos(\theta_x) \cos(\theta_y)$.</text>
<explanation>The solver carefully works through the algebraic manipulation, factoring the expression and simplifying it to a more manageable form. This demonstrates attention to detail and the ability to verify mathematical steps, which is essential for error detection.</explanation>
