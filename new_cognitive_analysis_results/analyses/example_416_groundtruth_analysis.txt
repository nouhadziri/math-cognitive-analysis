Problem:
Identify the starting material (A) and the final product (B) in the following reactions:
Styrene + A (Grubbs catalyst)---> (E)-(3-methylbut-1-en-1-yl)benzene
3-(allyloxy)prop-1-ene (Grubbs catalyst) ---> B
Answer Choices:
(A) A = 1-bromo-3-methylbutane, B = 2,5-dihydrofuran
(B) A = 3-methylbut-1-ene, B = tetrahydro-2H-pyran
(C) A = 3-methylbut-1-ene, B = 2,5-dihydrofuran
(D) A = 1-bromo-3-methylbutane, B = tetrahydro-2H-pyran

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
A. The reaction is an example of alkene metathesis. In this reaction, the internal carbons of the double bonds in styrene and 3-methylbut-1-ene come together to synthesize the desired metathesis product, ((E)-(3-methylbut-1-en-1-yl)benzene), with ethylene produced as a byproduct.
B. In this metathesis reaction, the double bond-bearing carbons of 3-(allyloxy)prop-1-ene come together to form the metathesis product (2,5-dihydrofuran), with ethylene being released in the gaseous form. Moreover, two double bonds within a single molecule contribute to the closure of the ring, a process known as ring-closing olefin metathesis.
