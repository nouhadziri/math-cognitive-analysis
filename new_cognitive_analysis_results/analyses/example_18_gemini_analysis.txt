Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
The group is $\mathbb{Z}^2$ under addition.
H is the smallest subgroup containing (3,8), (4,-1), and (5,4).
This means H is the set of all linear combinations of these vectors with integer coefficients.
$H = \{ a(3,8) + b(4,-1) + c(5,4) | a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \}$

$H_{xy}$ is the smallest subgroup containing $(0,x)$ and $(1,y)$.
$H_{xy} = \{ m(0,x) + n(1,y) | m, n \in \mathbb{Z} \} = \{ (n, mx+ny) | m, n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$

We need to find some pair $(x,y)$ with $x>0$ such that $H = H_{xy}$.
This means that the generators of H can be expressed as linear combinations of the generators of $H_{xy}$, and vice versa.

The generators of H are (3,8), (4,-1), (5,4).
The generators of $H_{xy}$ are (0,x), (1,y).

For $H \subseteq H_{xy}$:
(3,8) = $n_1(1,y) + m_1(0,x) = (n_1, m_1x+n_1y)$
$n_1 = 3$
$m_1x+3y = 8$

(4,-1) = $n_2(1,y) + m_2(0,x) = (n_2, m_2x+n_2y)$
$n_2 = 4$
$m_2x+4y = -1$

(5,4) = $n_3(1,y) + m_3(0,x) = (n_3, m_3x+n_3y)$
$n_3 = 5$
$m_3x+5y = 4$

For $H_{xy} \subseteq H$:
(0,x) = $a_1(3,8) + b_1(4,-1) + c_1(5,4) = (3a_1+4b_1+5c_1, 8a_1-b_1+4c_1)$
$3a_1+4b_1+5c_1 = 0$
$8a_1-b_1+4c_1 = x$

(1,y) = $a_2(3,8) + b_2(4,-1) + c_2(5,4) = (3a_2+4b_2+5c_2, 8a_2-b_2+4c_2)$
$3a_2+4b_2+5c_2 = 1$
$8a_2-b_2+4c_2 = y$

From the first set of equations:
$m_1x = 8 - 3y$
$m_2x = -1 - 4y$
$m_3x = 4 - 5y$

We need to find integer solutions for $m_1, m_2, m_3, x, y$.
Multiply the equations by $x$:
$m_1x^2 = 8x - 3xy$
$m_2x^2 = -x - 4xy$
$m_3x^2 = 4x - 5xy$

Consider the subgroup H. We can use the concept of the Smith Normal Form of the matrix formed by the generators.
The matrix is $\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 8 & -1 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$.
We can perform row operations to simplify this matrix.
$R_2 \rightarrow R_2 - 2R_1$: $\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -6 \end{pmatrix}$
$R_1 \leftrightarrow R_2$: $\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -9 & -6 \\ 3 & 4 & 5 \end{pmatrix}$
$R_2 \rightarrow R_2 - R_1$: $\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -9 & -6 \\ 1 & 13 & 11 \end{pmatrix}$
$R_1 \leftrightarrow R_2$: $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 13 & 11 \\ 2 & -9 & -6 \end{pmatrix}$
$R_2 \rightarrow R_2 - 2R_1$: $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 13 & 11 \\ 0 & -35 & -28 \end{pmatrix}$
Divide the second row by -7: $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 13 & 11 \\ 0 & 5 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$

The subgroup H is generated by (1,0) and (0,d) where d is the gcd of the elements in the second row after reducing the first row.
Let's use the simplified generators (1, 13) and (0, 5).
Then $H = \{ a(1,13) + b(0,5) | a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \} = \{ (a, 13a+5b) | a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \}$.

Now we want $H = H_{xy}$.
$H_{xy} = \{ n(1,y) + m(0,x) | m, n \in \mathbb{Z} \} = \{ (n, ny+mx) | m, n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$.

For $H \subseteq H_{xy}$:
(1, 13) = $n_1(1,y) + m_1(0,x) = (n_1, n_1y+m_1x)$
$n_1 = 1$
$13 = y+m_1x$

(0, 5) = $n_2(1,y) + m_2(0,x) = (n_2, n_2y+m_2x)$
$n_2 = 0$
$5 = 0y+m_2x \Rightarrow 5 = m_2x$

Since $x>0$ and $m_2$ is an integer, $x$ must be a positive divisor of 5.
So $x \in \{1, 5\}$.

Case 1: $x=1$.
$5 = m_2(1) \Rightarrow m_2 = 5$.
$13 = y+m_1(1) \Rightarrow y = 13 - m_1$.
We need to check if $H_{xy} \subseteq H$.
The generators of $H_{xy}$ are (0,1) and (1,y).
(0,1) = $a(1,13) + b(0,5) = (a, 13a+5b)$
$a = 0$
$1 = 13(0) + 5b \Rightarrow 1 = 5b$. No integer solution for b.
So x=1 is not possible.

Case 2: $x=5$.
$5 = m_2(5) \Rightarrow m_2 = 1$.
$13 = y+m_1(5) \Rightarrow y = 13 - 5m_1$. Let $m_1 = 2$, then $y = 13 - 10 = 3$.
So a possible pair is (x,y) = (5,3).

Let's verify if $H = H_{5,3}$.
$H_{5,3}$ is generated by (0,5) and (1,3).
$H_{5,3} = \{ n(1,3) + m(0,5) | m, n \in \mathbb{Z} \} = \{ (n, 3n+5m) | m, n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$.

Generators of H are (3,8), (4,-1), (5,4).
(3,8) = $n_1(1,3) + m_1(0,5) = (n_1, 3n_1+5m_1)$
$n_1 = 3$
$8 = 3(3) + 5m_1 \Rightarrow 8 = 9 + 5m_1 \Rightarrow -1 = 5m_1$. No integer solution for $m_1$.

Let's go back to the Smith Normal Form.
The simplified generators are (1, 13) and (0, 5).
So $H = \{ a(1,13) + b(0,5) | a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \}$.

We want $H_{xy} = H$.
The generators of $H_{xy}$ are $(0,x)$ and $(1,y)$.
We need (0,x) and (1,y) to generate H.
This means (0,x) and (1,y) can generate (1,13) and (0,5), and vice versa.

(1,13) = $n_1(1,y) + m_1(0,x) = (n_1, n_1y+m_1x)$
$n_1 = 1$
$13 = y+m_1x$

(0,5) = $n_2(1,y) + m_2(0,x) = (n_2, n_2y+m_2x)$
$n_2 = 0$
$5 = m_2x$

(0,x) = $a_1(1,13) + b_1(0,5) = (a_1, 13a_1+5b_1)$
$a_1 = 0$
$x = 5b_1$

(1,y) = $a_2(1,13) + b_2(0,5) = (a_2, 13a_2+5b_2)$
$a_2 = 1$
$y = 13+5b_2$

From $5 = m_2x$ and $x = 5b_1$, we have $5 = m_2(5b_1)$, so $1 = m_2b_1$.
Since $m_2, b_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$, either $m_2=1, b_1=1$ or $m_2=-1, b_1=-1$.
Since $x>0$, $x = 5b_1$ implies $b_1 > 0$, so $b_1=1$.
Then $x = 5(1) = 5$.

From $13 = y+m_1x$, we have $13 = y+5m_1$.
From $y = 13+5b_2$.
$13 = (13+5b_2) + 5m_1$
$0 = 5b_2 + 5m_1$
$0 = b_2 + m_1$
$m_1 = -b_2$.

We need to find some integers $m_1, b_2$ such that the conditions are satisfied.
Let $b_2 = 0$, then $m_1 = 0$.
$x=5$, $y = 13+5(0) = 13$.
Check if $H = H_{5,13}$.
$H_{5,13}$ is generated by (0,5) and (1,13).
These are the simplified generators of H, so $H = H_{5,13}$.
Here $x=5 > 0$.

Let's check another value for $b_2$. Let $b_2 = 1$, then $m_1 = -1$.
$x=5$, $y = 13+5(1) = 18$.
Check if $H = H_{5,18}$.
$H_{5,18}$ is generated by (0,5) and (1,18).
We need to check if (1,13) is in $H_{5,18}$.
$(1,13) = n(1,18) + m(0,5) = (n, 18n+5m)$
$n=1$
$13 = 18(1) + 5m$
$13 = 18 + 5m$
$-5 = 5m$
$m = -1$.
So (1,13) is in $H_{5,18}$.

We need to check if (0,5) is in $H_{5,18}$.
$(0,5) = n(1,18) + m(0,5) = (n, 18n+5m)$
$n=0$
$5 = 18(0) + 5m$
$5 = 5m$
$m = 1$.
So (0,5) is in $H_{5,18}$.
So $H \subseteq H_{5,18}$.

We need to check if the generators of $H_{5,18}$ are in H.
(0,5) is a generator of H.
(1,18) = $a(1,13) + b(0,5) = (a, 13a+5b)$
$a=1$
$18 = 13(1) + 5b$
$18 = 13 + 5b$
$5 = 5b$
$b = 1$.
So (1,18) is in H.
So $H_{5,18} \subseteq H$.
Thus $H = H_{5,18}$.
Here $x=5 > 0$.

The question asks for some pair (x,y). We found two pairs: (5,13) and (5,18).

Let's verify the calculations.
The subgroup H is generated by (3,8), (4,-1), (5,4).
The Smith Normal Form calculation:
$\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 8 & -1 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 13 & 11 \\ 0 & 5 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$
The subgroup H is generated by (1,13) and (0,5).

The subgroup $H_{xy}$ is generated by (0,x) and (1,y).
If $H = H_{xy}$, then the generators must span the same subgroup.
This means (0,x) and (1,y) can be written as linear combinations of (1,13) and (0,5), and vice versa.

(0,x) = $a(1,13) + b(0,5) = (a, 13a+5b)$
$a=0$
$x = 5b$
Since $x>0$, $b>0$.

(1,y) = $c(1,13) + d(0,5) = (c, 13c+5d)$
$c=1$
$y = 13+5d$

(1,13) = $e(1,y) + f(0,x) = (e, ey+fx)$
$e=1$
$13 = y+fx$

(0,5) = $g(1,y) + h(0,x) = (g, gy+hx)$
$g=0$
$5 = hx$

From $x = 5b$ and $5 = hx$, we get $5 = h(5b)$, so $1 = hb$.
Since b is a positive integer, $b=1$ and $h=1$.
Then $x = 5(1) = 5$.

From $13 = y+fx$, we have $13 = y+5f$.
From $y = 13+5d$.
$13 = (13+5d) + 5f$
$0 = 5d+5f$
$0 = d+f$
$f = -d$.

Since d is an integer, we can choose any integer for d.
If $d=0$, then $y = 13+5(0) = 13$. $f=0$.
If $d=1$, then $y = 13+5(1) = 18$. $f=-1$.
If $d=-1$, then $y = 13+5(-1) = 8$. $f=1$.

Possible pairs (x,y) are (5, 13+5d) for any integer d.
Since we need $x>0$, and $x=5$, this condition is satisfied.

We need to find some pair (x,y) with x>0.
Let's choose d=0, then (x,y) = (5,13).
Let's choose d=1, then (x,y) = (5,18).
Let's choose d=-1, then (x,y) = (5,8).

Final check with (5,8):
$H_{5,8}$ generated by (0,5) and (1,8).
(1,13) = $a(1,8) + b(0,5) = (a, 8a+5b)$
$a=1$
$13 = 8(1) + 5b \Rightarrow 5 = 5b \Rightarrow b=1$.
(0,5) = $c(1,8) + d(0,5) = (c, 8c+5d)$
$c=0$
$5 = 8(0) + 5d \Rightarrow 5 = 5d \Rightarrow d=1$.
So the generators of H are in $H_{5,8}$.

(0,5) is a generator of $H_{5,8}$.
(1,8) = $e(1,13) + f(0,5) = (e, 13e+5f)$
$e=1$
$8 = 13(1) + 5f \Rightarrow -5 = 5f \Rightarrow f=-1$.
So the generators of $H_{5,8}$ are in H.
Thus $H = H_{5,8}$.
Here $x=5 > 0$.

Case 1: $x=1$.
$5 = m_2(1) \Rightarrow m_2 = 5$.
$13 = y+m_1(1) \Rightarrow y = 13 - m_1$.
We need to check if $H_{xy} \subseteq H$.

So x=1 is not possible.

(1,y) = $a_2(3,8) + b_2(4,-1) + c_2(5,4) = (3a_2+4b_2+5c_2, 8a_2-b_2+4c_2)$
$3a_2+4b_2+5c_2 = 1$
$8a_2-b_2+4c_2 = y$</text>
<explanation>The solver sets up a system of equations by expressing each generator of H as a linear combination of the generators of H_xy, and vice versa. This algebraic manipulation creates concrete conditions that must be satisfied for the two subgroups to be equal.</explanation>

<text>From $13 = y+fx$, we have $13 = y+5f$.
From $y = 13+5d$.
$13 = (13+5d) + 5f$
$0 = 5d+5f$
$0 = d+f$
$f = -d$.</text>
<explanation>The solver substitutes one equation into another and performs algebraic manipulations to derive a relationship between the variables d and f. This demonstrates the ability to combine equations to extract useful information about the constraints on the solution.</explanation>

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify recurring structures, relationships, or regularities in mathematical expressions or data that can lead to insights about the problem's solution.</definition>

<text>Since d is an integer, we can choose any integer for d.
If $d=0$, then $y = 13+5(0) = 13$. $f=0$.
If $d=1$, then $y = 13+5(1) = 18$. $f=-1$.
If $d=-1$, then $y = 13+5(-1) = 8$. $f=1$.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes a pattern in the solution structure, namely that y can be expressed as 13+5d for any integer d. This pattern recognition allows the solver to generate multiple valid solutions.</explanation>
