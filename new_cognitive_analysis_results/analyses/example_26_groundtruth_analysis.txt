Problem:
2 mol of $\mathrm{Hg}(g)$ is combusted in a fixed volume bomb calorimeter with excess of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at $298 \mathrm{~K}$ and 1 atm into $\mathrm{HgO}(s)$. During the reaction, temperature increases from $298.0 \mathrm{~K}$ to $312.8 \mathrm{~K}$. If heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter and enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{Hg}(g)$ are $20.00 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ and $61.32 \mathrm{~kJ}$ $\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ at $298 \mathrm{~K}$, respectively, the calculated standard molar enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{HgO}(s)$ at 298 $\mathrm{K}$ is $\mathrm{X} \mathrm{kJ} \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. What is the value of $|\mathrm{X}|$?

[Given: Gas constant $\mathrm{R}=8.3 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ ]

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
90.39

Analysis:
I apologize, but I notice that the provided thinking trajectory only contains the answer "90.39" without any detailed solution steps. To properly analyze cognitive skills, I need to see the solver's reasoning process. The single number doesn't provide enough information to identify specific cognitive skills used.

However, I can analyze what cognitive skills would typically be needed to solve this thermochemistry problem:
