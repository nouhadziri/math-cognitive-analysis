Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to find a vector v such that when I compute each of these cross products and add them up, the result is the zero vector. The equation is a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's parse the given equation:

i × [(v - j) × i] + j × [(v - k) × j] + k × [(v - i) × k] = 0

I need to simplify each term one by one. Maybe there's a vector identity that would help here. Remember that for any vectors a, b, and c, the triple cross product a × (b × c) can be expanded using the vector triple product formula: a × (b × c) = b(a · c) - c(a · b). However, in each term here, it's the cross product of a vector with another cross product. Let's see.

Wait, the structure is: vector × [something × vector]. Maybe I need to use the same triple product identity but adjust for the order. Let me recall the identity: a × (b × c) = b(a · c) - c(a · b). So here, each term has the form a × (b × c), where a is one of the standard basis vectors (i, j, k), and the inside cross product is (v - another basis vector) × the same basis vector a.

Wait, first term: i × [(v - j) × i]. Let’s write that as i × [(v - j) × i]. According to the vector triple product formula, substituting a = i, b = (v - j), c = i. Then:

a × (b × c) = b(a · c) - c(a · b)

So in this case:
i × [(v - j) × i] = (v - j)(i · i) - i(i · (v - j))

Since i · i = 1, and i · (v - j) is the i-component of (v - j). Let's denote v as (v1, v2, v3), so (v - j) = (v1, v2 - 1, v3). Then i · (v - j) = v1.

So first term expansion:

(v - j)(1) - i(v1) = (v - j) - v1 i

Similarly, let's do the same for the second term: j × [(v - k) × j].

Applying the triple product identity again:

j × [(v - k) × j] = (v - k)(j · j) - j(j · (v - k))

Since j · j = 1 and j · (v - k) is the j-component of (v - k). If v = (v1, v2, v3), then (v - k) = (v1, v2, v3 - 1). So j · (v - k) = v2.

Thus, second term expansion:

(v - k) - v2 j

Similarly, third term: k × [(v - i) × k]

k × [(v - i) × k] = (v - i)(k · k) - k(k · (v - i))

k · k = 1, k · (v - i) is the k-component of (v - i). Since (v - i) = (v1 - 1, v2, v3). So k · (v - i) = v3.

Thus third term expansion:

(v - i) - v3 k

So putting all three terms together, the left-hand side of the equation becomes:

[(v - j) - v1 i] + [(v - k) - v2 j] + [(v - i) - v3 k] = 0

Let me simplify this expression step by step.

First, expand each of the brackets:

First term: (v - j) - v1 i = v - j - v1 i

Second term: (v - k) - v2 j = v - k - v2 j

Third term: (v - i) - v3 k = v - i - v3 k

Now adding these three terms:

[v - j - v1 i] + [v - k - v2 j] + [v - i - v3 k]

Combine the three v terms: v + v + v = 3v

Now combine the other terms:

- j - k - i (from subtracting the basis vectors) and - v1 i - v2 j - v3 k (from the terms with coefficients)

So combining:

3v - (i + j + k) - (v1 i + v2 j + v3 k) = 0

But notice that (v1 i + v2 j + v3 k) is just the vector v itself. So the equation becomes:

3v - (i + j + k) - v = 0

Simplify this:

3v - v - (i + j + k) = 0 ⇒ 2v - (i + j + k) = 0

Therefore, solving for v:

2v = i + j + k

Divide both sides by 2:

v = (i + j + k)/2

So, v is the vector (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Let me check if this works to make sure.

Check:

Plugging v = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) back into the original equation.

First Term: i × [(v - j) × i]

Calculate v - j = (1/2, 1/2 - 1, 1/2) = (1/2, -1/2, 1/2)

Compute (v - j) ×i: cross product of (1/2, -1/2, 1/2) with i = (1,0,0)

Using determinant:

|i   j   k |
|1/2 -1/2 1/2|
|1   0   0 |

Which is i*(-1/2*0 - 1/2*0) - j*(1/2*0 - 1/2*1) + k*(1/2*0 - (-1/2)*1)

Simplify:

i*(0 - 0) - j*(0 - 1/2) + k*(0 + 1/2) = 0i + (1/2)j + (1/2)k

Then i × [this result] = cross product of i with (0, 1/2, 1/2)

Which is (1,0,0) × (0, 1/2, 1/2) = determinant:

i   j   k
1   0   0
0  1/2 1/2

Calculates to i*(0*1/2 - 0*1/2) - j*(1*1/2 - 0*0) + k*(1*1/2 - 0*0) = 0i - (1/2)j + (1/2)k

So first term is - (1/2) j + (1/2)k

Second term: j × [(v - k) × j]

v - k = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2 - 1) = (1/2, 1/2, -1/2)

Compute (v -k) × j: cross product of (1/2,1/2,-1/2) with j=(0,1,0)

Determinant:

i   j   k
1/2 1/2 -1/2
0   1   0

Expanding, this is i*(1/2*0 - (-1/2)*1) - j*(1/2*0 - (-1/2)*0) + k*(1/2*1 - 1/2*0)

Simplify:

i*(0 + 1/2) - j*(0 - 0) + k*(1/2 - 0) = (1/2)i +0j + (1/2)k

Then j cross product with this:

(0,1,0) × (1/2, 0, 1/2) = determinant:

i   j   k
0   1   0
1/2 0  1/2

Calculates to i*(1*1/2 - 0*0) - j*(0*1/2 - 0*1/2) + k*(0*0 -1*1/2) = (1/2)i - 0j - (1/2)k

So second term is (1/2)i - (1/2)k

Third term: k × [(v - i) × k]

v -i = (1/2 -1, 1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2, 1/2, 1/2)

Compute (v -i) × k: cross product of (-1/2,1/2,1/2) with k=(0,0,1)

Determinant:

i   j   k
-1/2 1/2 1/2
0   0   1

Expanding:

i*(1/2*1 - 1/2*0) - j*(-1/2*1 - 1/2*0) + k*(-1/2*0 - 1/2*0) = i*(1/2) - j*(-1/2) +k*0

Thus, the cross product is (1/2)i + (1/2)j +0k

Now k cross this:

(0,0,1) × (1/2,1/2,0) = determinant:

i   j   k
0   0   1
1/2 1/2 0

Which is i*(0*0 - 1*1/2) - j*(0*0 -1*1/2) +k*(0*1/2 -0*1/2)

That is, (-1/2)i + (1/2)j +0k

So third term is (-1/2)i + (1/2)j

Therefore, combining all three terms:

First term: - (1/2)j + (1/2)k

Second term: (1/2)i - (1/2)k

Third term: (-1/2)i + (1/2)j

Adding them together:

Combine the i components: (1/2)i - (1/2)i = 0i

Combine the j components: - (1/2)j + (1/2)j = 0j

Combine the k components: (1/2)k - (1/2)k = 0k

Sum total: 0i +0j +0k = 0, which checks out. So our solution v = (1/2,1/2,1/2) works. Therefore, that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{i} + \dfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{j} + \dfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{k}}

First Term: i × [(v - j) × i]

Calculate v - j = (1/2, 1/2 - 1, 1/2) = (1/2, -1/2, 1/2)

Compute (v - j) ×i: cross product of (1/2, -1/2, 1/2) with i = (1,0,0)

Using determinant:

|i   j   k |
|1/2 -1/2 1/2|
|1   0   0 |

Which is i*(-1/2*0 - 1/2*0) - j*(1/2*0 - 1/2*1) + k*(1/2*0 - (-1/2)*1)

Simplify:

i*(0 - 0) - j*(0 - 1/2) + k*(0 + 1/2) = 0i + (1/2)j + (1/2)k

Then i × [this result] = cross product of i with (0, 1/2, 1/2)

Which is (1,0,0) × (0, 1/2, 1/2) = determinant:

i   j   k
1   0   0
0  1/2 1/2

Calculates to i*(0*1/2 - 0*1/2) - j*(1*1/2 - 0*0) + k*(1*1/2 - 0*0) = 0i - (1/2)j + (1/2)k

So first term is - (1/2) j + (1/2)k

Second term: j × [(v - k) × j]

v - k = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2 - 1) = (1/2, 1/2, -1/2)

Compute (v -k) × j: cross product of (1/2,1/2,-1/2) with j=(0,1,0)

Determinant:

i   j   k
1/2 1/2 -1/2
0   1   0

Expanding, this is i*(1/2*0 - (-1/2)*1) - j*(1/2*0 - (-1/2)*0) + k*(1/2*1 - 1/2*0)

Simplify:

i*(0 + 1/2) - j*(0 - 0) + k*(1/2 - 0) = (1/2)i +0j + (1/2)k

Then j cross product with this:

(0,1,0) × (1/2, 0, 1/2) = determinant:

i   j   k
0   1   0
1/2 0  1/2

Calculates to i*(1*1/2 - 0*0) - j*(0*1/2 - 0*1/2) + k*(0*0 -1*1/2) = (1/2)i - 0j - (1/2)k

So second term is (1/2)i - (1/2)k

Third term: k × [(v - i) × k]

v -i = (1/2 -1, 1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2, 1/2, 1/2)

Compute (v -i) × k: cross product of (-1/2,1/2,1/2) with k=(0,0,1)

Determinant:

i   j   k
-1/2 1/2 1/2
0   0   1

Expanding:

i*(1/2*1 - 1/2*0) - j*(-1/2*1 - 1/2*0) + k*(-1/2*0 - 1/2*0) = i*(1/2) - j*(-1/2) +k*0

Thus, the cross product is (1/2)i + (1/2)j +0k

Now k cross this:

(0,0,1) × (1/2,1/2,0) = determinant:

i   j   k
0   0   1
1/2 1/2 0

Which is i*(0*0 - 1*1/2) - j*(0*0 -1*1/2) +k*(0*1/2 -0*1/2)

That is, (-1/2)i + (1/2)j +0k

So third term is (-1/2)i + (1/2)j</text>

Adding them together:

Combine the i components: (1/2)i - (1/2)i = 0i

Combine the j components: - (1/2)j + (1/2)j = 0j

Combine the k components: (1/2)k - (1/2)k = 0k

Sum total: 0i +0j +0k = 0, which checks out. So our solution v = (1/2,1/2,1/2) works. Therefore, that's the answer.</text>
