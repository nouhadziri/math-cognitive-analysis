Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Define the topology:**
   The open sets in this topology are those Lebesgue-measurable sets which have density 1 at all their points. Specifically, a set \( U \) is open if for every \( x \in U \), the density of \( U \) at \( x \) is 1. The density of a set \( E \) at a point \( x \) is defined as:
   \[
   \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{\lambda(E \cap (x-r, x+r))}{2r} = 1,
   \]
   where \( \lambda \) denotes the Lebesgue measure.

2. **Regularity:**
   To show that the topology is regular, we need to show that for any closed set \( F \) and a point \( x \notin F \), there exist disjoint open sets containing \( F \) and \( x \).

   Let \( F \) be a closed set in this topology and \( x \notin F \). Without loss of generality, assume \( x = 0 \). Since \( F \) is closed, its complement \( \mathbb{R} \setminus F \) is open and has density 1 at all its points, including 0.

   Construct a sequence \( (x_n) \) of positive reals converging to 0 such that the measure of \( F \cap (-t, t) \) is at most \( \frac{1}{n} \) times the measure of \( (-t, t) \) for all \( 0 < t \leq x_n \). This is possible because \( \mathbb{R} \setminus F \) has density 1 around 0. Also, assume \( 2x_{n+1} < x_n \) for all \( n \).

   Define \( D_n \) as an open set covering \( F \cap ((-x_n, x_n) \setminus (-x_{n+1}, x_{n+1})) \) with measure \( \leq \frac{2}{n} \) times the measure of \( (-x_n, x_n) \setminus (-x_{n+1}, x_{n+1}) \). The union \( D = \bigcup_{n} D_n \) is an open set containing \( F \) but not 0. Its complement \( U \) has density 1 at 0. By the Lebesgue Density Theorem, we can eliminate a set of measure zero from \( U \) so that the remainder has density 1 at all its points. Thus, we have disjoint open sets containing \( x \) and \( F \).

3. **Non-normality:**
   To show that the topology is not normal, we need to find two disjoint closed sets that cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.

   Let \( A \) and \( B \) be disjoint dense \( G_\delta \) sets of measure zero. Such sets can be constructed using standard techniques in measure theory. \( A \) and \( B \) are disjoint closed sets in our topology. Assume, for contradiction, that there exist disjoint open sets \( U \supset A \) and \( V \supset B \).

   For each positive integer \( n \), let \( A_n \) (resp. \( B_n \)) be the subset of \( A \) (resp. \( B \)) consisting of those points \( x \) with the property that the measure of \( (x-t, x+t) \cap U \) (resp. \( (x-t, x+t) \cap V \)) is at least \( \frac{2}{3} \) times the measure of \( (-t, t) \) for all \( 0 < t \leq \frac{1}{n} \). \( A_n \) and \( B_n \) are closed subsets of \( A \) and \( B \), respectively, and \( A = \bigcup A_n \) and \( B = \bigcup B_n \).

   By Baire's Theorem, since \( A \) and \( B \) are \( G_\delta \) sets in a Polish space, we can find an \( n \) and an interval of the real line in which both \( A_n \) and \( B_n \) are dense. This leads to a contradiction because we would find two intervals of length \( \frac{2}{n} \), arbitrarily close, such that \( U \) has density \( \geq \frac{2}{3} \) in one of them, while \( V \), which is disjoint from \( U \), has density \( \geq \frac{2}{3} \) in the other one. This is impossible, hence the topology is not normal.
