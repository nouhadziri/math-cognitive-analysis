Problem:
Given a real number $x,$ let $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denote the greatest integer less than or equal to $x.$ For a certain integer $k,$ there are exactly $70$ positive integers $n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots, n_{70}$ such that $k=\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n_{1}}\rfloor = \lfloor\sqrt[3]{n_{2}}\rfloor = \cdots = \lfloor\sqrt[3]{n_{70}}\rfloor$ and $k$ divides $n_{i}$ for all $i$ such that $1 \leq i \leq 70.$ Find the maximum value of $\frac{n_{i}}{k}$ for $1\leq i \leq 70.$

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the maximum value of $\frac{n_{i}}{k}$ under certain conditions. We are given that there are exactly $70$ positive integers $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_{70}$ such that $\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n_{i}}\rfloor = k$ and $k$ divides $n_{i}.$

The condition $\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n_{i}}\rfloor = k$ means that $k \leq \sqrt[3]{n_{i}} < k+1.$ Cubing these inequalities, we get $k^3 \leq n_{i} < (k+1)^3.$
Since $n_i$ are integers, we have $k^3 \leq n_{i} \leq (k+1)^3 - 1.$
The interval for $n_i$ is $[k^3, (k+1)^3 - 1].$

We are also given that $k$ divides $n_{i},$ which means $n_{i} \equiv 0 \pmod{k}.$
So, we are looking for multiples of $k$ in the interval $[k^3, (k+1)^3 - 1].$
The multiples of $k$ in this interval are of the form $mk,$ where $m$ is an integer.
We need $k^3 \leq mk \leq (k+1)^3 - 1.$
Dividing by $k$ (assuming $k > 0$), we get $k^2 \leq m \leq \frac{(k+1)^3 - 1}{k}.$
We have $\frac{(k+1)^3 - 1}{k} = \frac{k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1 - 1}{k} = \frac{k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k}{k} = k^2 + 3k + 3.$

So, the range for $m$ is $k^2 \leq m \leq k^2 + 3k + 3.$
The number of integers $m$ in this range is $(k^2 + 3k + 3) - k^2 + 1 = 3k + 4.$
This number represents the number of positive integers $n$ such that $\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n}\rfloor = k$ and $k$ divides $n.$

We are given that there are exactly $70$ such positive integers, so $3k + 4 = 70.$
$3k = 66,$ so $k = 22.$
Since $k$ is an integer, this value of $k$ is valid. Note that we assumed $k > 0.$ If $k \leq 0,$ the analysis would be different.

Case 1: $k > 0.$
We found $k = 22.$

Case 2: $k = 0.$
If $k = 0,$ then $\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n_{i}}\rfloor = 0,$ which means $0 \leq \sqrt[3]{n_{i}} < 1,$ so $0 \leq n_{i} < 1.$
Since $n_i$ are positive integers, this case is not possible.

Case 3: $k < 0.$ Let $k = -p,$ where $p$ is a positive integer.
$\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n_{i}}\rfloor = -p.$ This means $-p \leq \sqrt[3]{n_{i}} < -p+1.$
Cubing gives $(-p)^3 \leq n_{i} < (-p+1)^3.$
$-p^3 \leq n_{i} < (1-p)^3.$
Since $n_i$ are positive, we need $-p^3 < (1-p)^3,$ which is always true.
The interval for $n_i$ is $[1, (1-p)^3 - 1].$  (Lower bound is 1 since $n_i$ are positive integers).
We also need $k$ divides $n_i,$ so $-p$ divides $n_i.$
$n_i$ is a multiple of $p.$
We need positive multiples of $p$ in the interval $[1, (1-p)^3 - 1].$
The multiples are $p, 2p, \ldots, mp,$ where $mp \leq (1-p)^3 - 1.$
$m \leq \frac{(1-p)^3 - 1}{p} = \frac{1 - 3p + 3p^2 - p^3 - 1}{p} = -3 + 3p - p^2.$
Since $m$ must be positive, we need $-3 + 3p - p^2 > 0,$ or $p^2 - 3p + 3 < 0.$
The discriminant of $p^2 - 3p + 3$ is $(-3)^2 - 4(1)(3) = 9 - 12 = -3 < 0.$
Since the leading coefficient is positive, $p^2 - 3p + 3$ is always positive.
This means there are no values of $p$ for which $-3 + 3p - p^2 > 0.$
Therefore, there are no positive multiples of $p$ in the interval, unless the interval is empty.

Let's recheck the bounds for $n_i$ when $k < 0.$
If $\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n_{i}}\rfloor = k,$ then $k \leq \sqrt[3]{n_{i}} < k+1.$
If $k = -1,$ then $-1 \leq \sqrt[3]{n_{i}} < 0,$ so $-1 \leq n_{i} < 0.$ No positive integers.
If $k = -2,$ then $-2 \leq \sqrt[3]{n_{i}} < -1,$ so $-8 \leq n_{i} < -1.$ No positive integers.

So, we must have $k > 0.$

Now, with $k = 22,$ the range for $n_i$ is $[k^3, (k+1)^3 - 1] = [22^3, 23^3 - 1].$
$22^3 = 10648.$
$23^3 = 12167.$
The interval is $[10648, 12166].$

We need $n_i$ to be multiples of $k = 22.$
The multiples of $22$ in the interval $[10648, 12166].$
The smallest multiple is $10648 = 22 \times 484.$
The largest multiple is $\leq 12166.$
$\frac{12166}{22} = 552.9 \ldots,$ so the largest integer $m$ is $552.$
The largest multiple is $22 \times 552 = 12144.$

The multiples are $22 \times 484, 22 \times 485, \ldots, 22 \times 552.$
The values of $\frac{n_i}{k}$ are the values of $m.$
We need to find the maximum value of $\frac{n_{i}}{k},$ which corresponds to the maximum value of $m.$
The maximum value of $m$ is $552.$

Let's verify the number of multiples.
Number of multiples = $552 - 484 + 1 = 68 + 1 = 69.$
This contradicts the given information that there are exactly $70$ such positive integers.

Let's recheck the calculation of the number of multiples.
The number of integers $m$ in the range $k^2 \leq m \leq k^2 + 3k + 3$ is $3k + 4.$
We set $3k + 4 = 70,$ which gave $k = 22.$

Let's re-examine the problem statement and my understanding.
We have exactly $70$ positive integers $n_1, \ldots, n_{70}$ satisfying the conditions.
The number of such integers is $3k + 4.$
So, $3k + 4 = 70.$ This part seems correct.

Perhaps there is an issue with the assumption $k > 0.$
If the problem statement implies that such an integer $k$ exists, then my analysis for $k \leq 0$ should be re-evaluated.

Consider the case when $k < 0.$ Let $k = -p,$ $p > 0.$
We need positive integers $n_i$ such that $\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n_{i}}\rfloor = -p$ and $-p$ divides $n_i.$
$\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n_{i}}\rfloor = -p \implies -p \leq \sqrt[3]{n_{i}} < -p+1.$
If $p = 1,$ then $-1 \leq \sqrt[3]{n_{i}} < 0.$ This implies $-1 \leq n_{i} < 0.$ No positive integers.
If $p > 1,$ then $-p+1 < 0.$
Cubing the inequalities: $(-p)^3 \leq n_{i} < (-p+1)^3.$
$-p^3 \leq n_{i} < (1-p)^3.$
Since $n_i$ are positive, we have $0 < n_{i} < (1-p)^3.$
We need $1-p < 0,$ so $p > 1.$
The interval for $n_i$ is $[1, (1-p)^3 - 1].$

We also need $-p$ divides $n_i.$
$n_i$ is a multiple of $p.$
Positive multiples of $p$ in the interval $[1, (1-p)^3 - 1].$
Multiples are $p, 2p, \ldots, mp,$ where $mp \leq (1-p)^3 - 1.$
$m \leq \frac{(1-p)^3 - 1}{p} = -3 + 3p - p^2.$
The number of such multiples is $\lfloor -3 + 3p - p^2 \rfloor.$

We are given that there are exactly $70$ such positive integers.
$\lfloor -p^2 + 3p - 3 \rfloor = 70.$
$70 \leq -p^2 + 3p - 3 < 71.$

Inequality 1: $70 \leq -p^2 + 3p - 3.$
$p^2 - 3p + 73 \leq 0.$
Discriminant $= (-3)^2 - 4(1)(73) = 9 - 292 = -283 < 0.$
Since the leading coefficient is positive, $p^2 - 3p + 73$ is always positive.
So, this inequality has no real solutions for $p.$

This confirms that $k$ cannot be negative.

So, we must have $k = 22.$

The question asks for the maximum value of $\frac{n_{i}}{k}.$
We have $\frac{n_{i}}{k} = m.$
The range for $m$ is $k^2 \leq m \leq k^2 + 3k + 3.$
The maximum value of $m$ is $k^2 + 3k + 3.$

With $k = 22,$ the maximum value of $\frac{n_{i}}{k}$ is $22^2 + 3(22) + 3 = 484 + 66 + 3 = 550 + 3 = 553.$

Let's double-check the bounds.
If $\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n}\rfloor = k,$ then $k^3 \leq n \leq (k+1)^3 - 1.$
We need multiples of $k$ in this range.
$n = qk.$
$k^3 \leq qk \leq (k+1)^3 - 1.$
$k^2 \leq q \leq \frac{(k+1)^3 - 1}{k} = k^2 + 3k + 3.$

The number of integers $q$ is $(k^2 + 3k + 3) - k^2 + 1 = 3k + 4.$
We are given that there are $70$ such integers, so $3k + 4 = 70,$ $k = 22.$

The values of $\frac{n_i}{k}$ are the possible values of $q.$
The maximum value of $q$ is $k^2 + 3k + 3.$
Substituting $k = 22,$ the maximum value is $22^2 + 3(22) + 3 = 484 + 66 + 3 = 553.$

Consider an example. Let $k = 1.$
$\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n}\rfloor = 1 \implies 1 \leq \sqrt[3]{n} < 2 \implies 1 \leq n < 8.$
$n \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}.$
We also need $k$ divides $n,$ so $1$ divides $n.$ All these values of $n$ work.
The number of such $n$ is $7.$
Formula: $3k + 4 = 3(1) + 4 = 7.$ Matches.

The values of $\frac{n}{k} = \frac{n}{1} = n.$
Maximum value is $7.$
Formula: $k^2 + 3k + 3 = 1^2 + 3(1) + 3 = 1 + 3 + 3 = 7.$ Matches.

Consider $k = 2.$
$\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n}\rfloor = 2 \implies 2 \leq \sqrt[3]{n} < 3 \implies 8 \leq n < 27.$
$n \in \{8, 9, \ldots, 26\}.$
We need $k=2$ divides $n.$
Multiples of $2$ in the interval $[8, 26].$
$8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26.$
Number of multiples = $10.$
Formula: $3k + 4 = 3(2) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.$ Matches.

The values of $\frac{n}{k}$ are $\frac{8}{2}, \frac{10}{2}, \ldots, \frac{26}{2}.$
$4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.$
Maximum value is $13.$
Formula: $k^2 + 3k + 3 = 2^2 + 3(2) + 3 = 4 + 6 + 3 = 13.$ Matches.

Let's ensure the question is not asking for the maximum value of $n_i/k$ over all possible values of $k.$
The problem states "For a certain integer $k$," suggesting that $k$ is fixed.

The problem statement implies that there exists at least one such integer $k.$
We found that if such a $k$ exists, it must be $22.$

Alternative phrasing of the problem:
Find the maximum value of $m$ such that there exists an integer $k$ for which the number of positive integers $n$ satisfying $\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n}\rfloor = k$ and $k|n$ is $70.$

However, the phrasing "For a certain integer $k$" suggests that we first find $k.$

Consider the constraints more carefully.
$n_i$ are positive integers.
$k$ is an integer.

If we allowed $k=0,$ then $\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n}\rfloor = 0,$ so $0 \leq n < 1.$ No positive integers.

If $k < 0,$ we showed that there are no positive integers $n$ satisfying the conditions.

So, $k$ must be a positive integer.

The number of positive integers $n$ such that $\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n}\rfloor = k$ and $k|n$ is $3k + 4.$
We are given that this number is $70.$
$3k + 4 = 70 \implies k = 22.$

The positive integers $n_i$ satisfy $\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n_i}\rfloor = 22$ and $22|n_i.$
$22 \leq \sqrt[3]{n_i} < 23.$
$22^3 \leq n_i < 23^3.$
$10648 \leq n_i < 12167.$
$n_i \in [10648, 12166].$

$n_i$ are multiples of $22.$
$n_i = 22 m,$ where $m$ is an integer.
$10648 \leq 22m \leq 12166.$
$\frac{10648}{22} \leq m \leq \frac{12166}{22}.$
$484 \leq m \leq 552.9 \ldots.$
$484 \leq m \leq 552.$
The possible values of $m$ are $484, 485, \ldots, 552.$
The number of values of $m$ is $552 - 484 + 1 = 69.$

Something is wrong. The problem states there are exactly $70$ such integers.

Let's recheck the derivation of the number of integers.
The number of multiples of $k$ in the interval $[k^3, (k+1)^3 - 1].$
The multiples are $qk,$ where $k^3 \leq qk \leq (k+1)^3 - 1.$
$k^2 \leq q \leq \frac{(k+1)^3 - 1}{k} = k^2 + 3k + 3.$
The integer values of $q$ are from $k^2$ to $k^2 + 3k + 3,$ inclusive.
Number of values = $(k^2 + 3k + 3) - k^2 + 1 = 3k + 4.$

If $3k + 4 = 70,$ then $k = 22.$

Let's check the bounds carefully.
$\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n}\rfloor = k \implies k \leq \sqrt[3]{n} < k+1.$
$k^3 \leq n \leq (k+1)^3 - 1.$
If $k = 22,$ interval is $[10648, 12166].$
Multiples of $22$ in this interval.
Smallest multiple $\geq 10648$ is $10648 = 22 \times 484.$
Largest multiple $\leq 12166.$
$\frac{12166}{22} = 552.9 \ldots.$
Largest integer $m$ is $552.$
Largest multiple is $22 \times 552 = 12144.$

The multiples are $22 \times 484, 22 \times 485, \ldots, 22 \times 552.$
The values of $n_i$ are these multiples.
Number of such $n_i$ is $552 - 484 + 1 = 69.$

Where is the mistake?

Perhaps the interpretation of the problem statement is wrong.
"For a certain integer $k,$ there are exactly $70$ positive integers $n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots, n_{70}$ such that ..."

Maybe the question implies that such a $k$ exists, and we need to find it.
If the number of such integers is $70,$ then $3k + 4 = 70,$ so $k = 22.$
This seems consistent.

If $k = 22,$ the number of integers $n$ satisfying the conditions should be $70.$
Let's reconsider the bounds.
$\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n}\rfloor = 22 \implies 22 \leq \sqrt[3]{n} < 23.$
$10648 \leq n \leq 12166.$
We need multiples of $22$ in this range.
$n = 22m.$
$10648 \leq 22m \leq 12166.$
$484 \leq m \leq 552.$
The integer values of $m$ are $484, 485, \ldots, 552.$
Number of values = $552 - 484 + 1 = 69.$

Could there be an issue with the floor function?

Let's assume the number of integers is $70.$
This means $3k + 4 = 70,$ so $k = 22.$
The problem implies that such a $k$ exists.

The maximum value of $\frac{n_i}{k}$ is the maximum value of $m.$
The range for $m$ is $[k^2, k^2 + 3k + 3].$
The maximum value of $m$ is $k^2 + 3k + 3.$
If $k = 22,$ max value is $22^2 + 3(22) + 3 = 553.$

Could the problem statement be contradictory?
If $k = 22,$ the number of integers should be $69,$ not $70.$

Is it possible that the number of integers is related to the endpoints?
Consider the interval $[k^3, (k+1)^3 - 1].$
The multiples of $k$ are $k^3, k^3+k, \ldots,$ up to the largest multiple $\leq (k+1)^3 - 1.$

Let's check the upper bound calculation again.
$(k+1)^3 - 1 = k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k.$
The largest multiple of $k$ is $\leq k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k.$
The multiples are $k \cdot k^2, k \cdot (k^2+1), \ldots, k \cdot (k^2 + 3k + 3).$
The values of $\frac{n_i}{k}$ are $k^2, k^2+1, \ldots, k^2 + 3k + 3.$
Number of values = $(k^2 + 3k + 3) - k^2 + 1 = 3k + 4.$

Perhaps a re-read of the problem statement is needed.
"For a certain integer $k,$ there are exactly $70$ positive integers $n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots, n_{70}$ such that $k=\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n_{1}}\rfloor = \lfloor\sqrt[3]{n_{2}}\rfloor = \cdots = \lfloor\sqrt[3]{n_{70}}\rfloor$ and $k$ divides $n_{i}$ for all $i$ such that $1 \leq i \leq 70.$"

This implies that if such a $k$ exists, then the number of integers $n$ satisfying the conditions is $70.$
Our derivation shows that the number of such integers is $3k + 4.$
So, $3k + 4 = 70,$ which gives $k = 22.$
The value of $k$ is uniquely determined.

The maximum value of $\frac{n_i}{k}$ is indeed $k^2 + 3k + 3.$
With $k = 22,$ this is $553.$

Formula: $k^2 + 3k + 3 = 1^2 + 3(1) + 3 = 1 + 3 + 3 = 7.$ Matches.

Consider $k = 2.$
$\lfloor\sqrt[3]{n}\rfloor = 2 \implies 2 \leq \sqrt[3]{n} < 3 \implies 8 \leq n < 27.$
$n \in \{8, 9, \ldots, 26\}.$
We need $k=2$ divides $n.$</text>
<explanation>The solver continues verification by testing another case (k=2), showing thoroughness in checking their solution across multiple examples to ensure the formula is correct.</explanation>

<skill>Metacognitive Monitoring</skill>
<definition>The awareness and regulation of one's own thinking processes, including the ability to assess one's understanding, identify gaps in knowledge, and adjust problem-solving strategies accordingly.</definition>

<text>Let's ensure the question is not asking for the maximum value of $n_i/k$ over all possible values of $k.$
The problem states "For a certain integer $k$," suggesting that $k$ is fixed.</text>
<explanation>The solver pauses to reconsider their interpretation of the problem statement, showing awareness of potential misunderstandings and a willingness to revisit basic assumptions.</explanation>

<start>9183</start>
<end>9324</end>
<text>Something is wrong. The problem states there are exactly $70$ such integers.

Let's recheck the derivation of the number of integers.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes a contradiction between their result and the problem statement, demonstrating metacognitive awareness of potential errors in their reasoning and the need to revisit earlier steps.</explanation>

<start>10027</start>
<end>10075</end>
<text>Where is the mistake?

Perhaps the interpretation of the problem statement is wrong.</text>
<explanation>After repeated attempts to resolve the discrepancy, the solver steps back to question their fundamental understanding of the problem, showing metacognitive awareness and flexibility in thinking.</explanation>

<text>The discriminant of $p^2 - 3p + 3$ is $(-3)^2 - 4(1)(3) = 9 - 12 = -3 < 0.$
Since the leading coefficient is positive, $p^2 - 3p + 3$ is always positive.
This means there are no values of $p$ for which $-3 + 3p - p^2 > 0.$</text>
<explanation>The solver uses the discriminant formula from quadratic theory to determine that a certain inequality has no solutions, then logically infers the implications for the original problem. This shows sophisticated logical reasoning about mathematical conditions.</explanation>

<start>3517</start>
<end>3553</end>
<text>So, we must have $k > 0.$</text>
<explanation>After examining all possible cases for k, the solver makes a logical inference that k must be positive, eliminating all other possibilities through systematic reasoning.</explanation>
