Problem:
Consider the additive group  $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ . Let  $H$  be the smallest subgroup containing  $(3,8), (4,-1)$  and  $(5,4)$ .
Let  $H_{xy}$  be the smallest subgroup containing  $(0,x)$  and  $(1,y)$ . Find some pair  $(x,y)$  with  $x>0$  such that  $H=H_{xy}$ .

Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. We need to find a pair \((x, y)\) such that the smallest subgroup \(H\) containing \((3, 8)\), \((4, -1)\), and \((5, 4)\) is equal to the smallest subgroup \(H_{xy}\) containing \((0, x)\) and \((1, y)\).

2. Let's denote \(H = \langle (3, 8), (4, -1), (5, 4) \rangle\) and \(H_{xy} = \langle (0, x), (1, y) \rangle\).

3. We need to show that \(H = H_{75}\) where \(x = 7\) and \(y = 5\).

4. First, we show that \((3, 8)\), \((4, -1)\), and \((5, 4)\) can be expressed as linear combinations of \((0, 7)\) and \((1, 5)\):
   \[
   (3, 8) = -(0, 7) + 3(1, 5)
   \]
   \[
   (4, -1) = -3(0, 7) + 4(1, 5)
   \]
   \[
   (5, 4) = -3(0, 7) + 5(1, 5)
   \]
   This shows that \(\langle (0, 7), (1, 5) \rangle \subseteq \langle (3, 8), (4, -1), (5, 4) \rangle\).

5. Next, we show that \((0, 7)\) and \((1, 5)\) can be expressed as linear combinations of \((3, 8)\), \((4, -1)\), and \((5, 4)\):
   \[
   (0, 7) = -4(3, 8) - 7(4, -1) + 8(5, 4)
   \]
   \[
   (1, 5) = -4(3, 8) - 7(4, -1) + 8(5, 4)
   \]
   This shows that \(\langle (3, 8), (4, -1), (5, 4) \rangle \subseteq \langle (0, 7), (1, 5) \rangle\).

6. By double inclusion, we have:
   \[
   H = \langle (3, 8), (4, -1), (5, 4) \rangle = \langle (0, 7), (1, 5) \rangle = H_{75}
   \]

The final answer is \( \boxed{ (x, y) = (7, 5) } \).
