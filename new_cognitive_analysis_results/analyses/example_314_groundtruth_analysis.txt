Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Base Case: \( n = 3 \)**
   - We need to find \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) such that:
     \[
     x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 27
     \]
     and
     \[
     x_1 x_2 x_3 = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24}
     \]
   - Let's choose \( x_1 = -1 \). Then we need \( x_2 \) and \( x_3 \) such that:
     \[
     x_2 + x_3 = 28
     \]
     and
     \[
     x_2 x_3 = -\left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24}
     \]
   - The quadratic equation for \( x_2 \) and \( x_3 \) is:
     \[
     t^2 - 28t - \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24} = 0
     \]
   - The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:
     \[
     \Delta = 28^2 + 4 \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24} = 784 + 4 \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24}
     \]
   - Since \( \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24} \) is positive, \( \Delta > 0 \), so the quadratic equation has two real solutions. Therefore, there exist \( x_2 \) and \( x_3 \) such that the system is satisfied for \( n = 3 \).

2. **Inductive Step: Assume the system can be solved for \( n \geq 3 \)**
   - Suppose we have a solution \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^n x_k = 27
     \]
     and
     \[
     \prod_{k=1}^n x_k = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24}
     \]
   - Assume \( x_1 < 0 \). We need to find two reals \( x \) and \( y \) such that:
     \[
     x + y = x_1
     \]
     and
     \[
     xy = x_1
     \]
   - Consider the quadratic equation:
     \[
     t^2 - x_1 t + x_1 = 0
     \]
   - The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:
     \[
     \Delta = x_1^2 - 4x_1
     \]
   - Since \( x_1 < 0 \), \( \Delta > 0 \), so the quadratic equation has two real solutions. Let \( x \) be the negative solution and \( y \) be the positive solution.
   - Then the \( n+1 \)-tuple \( x, y, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) is a solution, and the first coordinate is \( < 0 \).

3. **Case \( n = 2 \)**
   - We need to find \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) such that:
     \[
     x_1 + x_2 = 27
     \]
     and
     \[
     x_1 x_2 = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24}
     \]
   - The quadratic equation for \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) is:
     \[
     t^2 - 27t + \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24} = 0
     \]
   - The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:
     \[
     \Delta = 27^2 - 4 \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24} = 729 - 4 \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24}
     \]
   - Since \( \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24} \) is very large, \( \Delta < 0 \), so the quadratic equation has no real solutions. Therefore, there is no solution for \( n = 2 \).

Conclusion:
- The system of equations can be solved in \( \mathbb{R} \) for all \( n \geq 3 \).

The final answer is \( \boxed{ n \geq 3 } \)
