<explanation>The answer "1.3" indicates the solver has determined the percentage error in the energy calculation.

<explanation>To arrive at this answer, the solver must have applied several formulas: (1) the formula for equivalent capacitance in series: 1/C_eq = 1/C₁ + 1/C₂, (2) the formula for energy stored in a capacitor: E = ½CV², and (3) error propagation formulas.
