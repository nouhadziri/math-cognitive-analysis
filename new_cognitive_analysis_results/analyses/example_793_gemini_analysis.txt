Problem:
A $7\times 1$ board is completely covered by $m\times 1$ tiles without overlap; each tile may cover any number of consecutive squares, and each tile lies completely on the board. Each tile is either red, blue, or green. Let $N$ be the number of tilings of the $7\times 1$ board in which all three colors are used at least once. For example, a $1\times 1$ red tile followed by a $2\times 1$ green tile, a $1\times 1$ green tile, a $2\times 1$ blue tile, and a $1\times 1$ green tile is a valid tiling. Note that if the $2\times 1$ blue tile is replaced by two $1\times 1$ blue tiles, this results in a different tiling. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$ .

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the number of ways to tile a $7\times 1$ board with colored $m\times 1$ tiles such that all three colors (red, blue, green) are used at least once. The order of the tiles matters, and the length of each tile can vary.

Let the length of the board be $n=7$.
The number of ways to tile a $n\times 1$ board with colored tiles can be determined by considering the composition of $n$. Each tiling corresponds to a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, where each integer represents the length of a tile.

Consider the number of ways to tile the $7\times 1$ board with colored tiles, without the constraint of using all three colors.
Each tile can be colored in 3 ways.

Let $T_n$ be the number of tilings of an $n\times 1$ board with colored tiles.
For $n=1$, the board can be covered by a $1\times 1$ tile, which can be red, blue, or green. $T_1 = 3$.
For $n=2$, the tilings are:
- $1, 1$: RR, RB, RG, BR, BB, BG, GR, GB, GG (9)
- $2$: R, B, G (3)
$T_2 = 9 + 3 = 12$.

Let $a_n$ be the number of ways to tile an $n\times 1$ board with uncolored tiles. This is the number of compositions of $n$. The number of compositions of $n$ is $2^{n-1}$.

Consider a tiling of the $n\times 1$ board. Let the lengths of the tiles be $l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_k$ such that $l_1 + l_2 + \ldots + l_k = n$.
Each tile can be colored in 3 ways.
If there are $k$ tiles in a tiling, there are $3^k$ ways to color them.

Let $c(n, k)$ be the number of ways to tile an $n\times 1$ board with exactly $k$ uncolored tiles. This is equivalent to the number of ways to write $n$ as a sum of $k$ positive integers, which is $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$.

The total number of tilings of an $n\times 1$ board with colored tiles is $T_n = \sum_{k=1}^n c(n, k) \cdot 3^k = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} 3^k$.
Let $j = k-1$, then $k = j+1$.
$T_n = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{j} 3^{j+1} = 3 \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{j} 3^j = 3 (1+3)^{n-1} = 3 \cdot 4^{n-1}$.

For $n=7$, the total number of tilings with colored tiles is $T_7 = 3 \cdot 4^{7-1} = 3 \cdot 4^6 = 3 \cdot 4096 = 12288$.

Now, we need to find the number of tilings where all three colors are used at least once. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let $A$ be the set of tilings using red.
Let $B$ be the set of tilings using blue.
Let $G$ be the set of tilings using green.

We want to find $|A \cap B \cap G|$.
The total number of tilings is $|U| = T_7 = 12288$.

Number of tilings using only red and blue colors:
Consider the number of tilings where each tile is either red or blue. Each tile has 2 color choices.
The number of such tilings is $2 \cdot 3^{n-1}$, where the base is 2 instead of 3.
Number of compositions of $n$ into $k$ parts is $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$.
Number of ways to color $k$ tiles with 2 colors is $2^k$.
Number of tilings with 2 colors = $\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} 2^k = 2 \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{j} 2^j = 2 (1+2)^{n-1} = 2 \cdot 3^{n-1}$.

Number of tilings using only red and blue colors = $2 \cdot 3^{7-1} = 2 \cdot 3^6 = 2 \cdot 729 = 1458$.
Similarly, number of tilings using only red and green colors = $1458$.
Number of tilings using only blue and green colors = $1458$.

Number of tilings using only red color:
Each tile is red. There is only 1 way to color the tiles.
The number of tilings with uncolored tiles is $2^{n-1}$.
Each tile is red, so the color is fixed.
Number of tilings using only red = number of compositions of $n = 2^{n-1}$.
For $n=7$, number of tilings using only red = $2^{7-1} = 2^6 = 64$.
Similarly, number of tilings using only blue = $64$.
Number of tilings using only green = $64$.

Using inclusion-exclusion:
$|A \cup B \cup G| = |A| + |B| + |G| - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap G| + |B \cap G|) + |A \cap B \cap G|$

Let $S_1 = |A| + |B| + |G|$
Let $S_2 = |A \cap B| + |A \cap G| + |B \cap G|$
Let $S_3 = |A \cap B \cap G|$

Total number of tilings = $T_n = 3 \cdot 4^{n-1}$.

Number of tilings using only red or blue = $2 \cdot 3^{n-1}$.
Number of tilings using only red = $1 \cdot 2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1}$.

$|A|$ = number of tilings using red. This means the colors are red or other.
Consider the set of tilings where the colors used are from {red}.
Number of such tilings is $2^{n-1}$.

Consider the set of tilings where the colors used are from {red, blue}.
Number of such tilings is $2 \cdot 3^{n-1}$.

Let $U$ be the set of all tilings with colors red, blue, green. $|U| = 3 \cdot 4^{n-1}$.
Let $A'$ be the set of tilings that do not use red. The colors used are blue or green.
Number of tilings using only blue or green = $2 \cdot 3^{n-1}$.

Let $B'$ be the set of tilings that do not use blue. Colors used are red or green.
Number of tilings using only red or green = $2 \cdot 3^{n-1}$.

Let $G'$ be the set of tilings that do not use green. Colors used are red or blue.
Number of tilings using only red or blue = $2 \cdot 3^{n-1}$.

$|A' \cap B'|$ = set of tilings that do not use red and do not use blue. Colors used is only green.
Number of tilings using only green = $1 \cdot 2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1}$.

$|A' \cap G'|$ = set of tilings that do not use red and do not use green. Colors used is only blue.
Number of tilings using only blue = $2^{n-1}$.

$|B' \cap G'|$ = set of tilings that do not use blue and do not use green. Colors used is only red.
Number of tilings using only red = $2^{n-1}$.

$|A' \cap B' \cap G'|$ = set of tilings that do not use red, blue, green. This is impossible as each tile has a color. The number is 0.

Number of tilings that use all three colors = Total number of tilings - Number of tilings that miss at least one color.
$N = |U| - |A' \cup B' \cup G'|$
$|A' \cup B' \cup G'| = |A'| + |B'| + |G'| - (|A' \cap B'| + |A' \cap G'| + |B' \cap G'|) + |A' \cap B' \cap G'|$
$|A' \cup B' \cup G'| = (2 \cdot 3^{n-1}) + (2 \cdot 3^{n-1}) + (2 \cdot 3^{n-1}) - (2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1}) + 0$
$|A' \cup B' \cup G'| = 3 \cdot (2 \cdot 3^{n-1}) - 3 \cdot 2^{n-1} = 6 \cdot 3^{n-1} - 3 \cdot 2^{n-1}$.

For $n=7$:
$|A' \cup B' \cup G'| = 6 \cdot 3^6 - 3 \cdot 2^6 = 6 \cdot 729 - 3 \cdot 64 = 4374 - 192 = 4182$.

$N = T_7 - |A' \cup B' \cup G'| = 12288 - 4182 = 8106$.

We need the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.
$N = 8106$.
Remainder when $8106$ is divided by $1000$ is $106$.

Let's verify the formula for small $n$.
$n=1$: $T_1 = 3 \cdot 4^0 = 3$.
$|A' \cup B' \cup G'| = 6 \cdot 3^0 - 3 \cdot 2^0 = 6 - 3 = 3$.
$N = 3 - 3 = 0$. This makes sense, as with a $1\times 1$ board, there is only one tile, so we can use at most one color.

$n=2$: $T_2 = 3 \cdot 4^1 = 12$.
$|A' \cup B' \cup G'| = 6 \cdot 3^1 - 3 \cdot 2^1 = 18 - 6 = 12$.
$N = 12 - 12 = 0$.
Consider a $2\times 1$ board. Tilings are $1, 1$ or $2$.
$1, 1$: RR, RB, RG, BR, BB, BG, GR, GB, GG (9)
$2$: R, B, G (3)
Total tilings = 12.
Tilings using only R: RR (from 1, 1), R (from 2) - 2.
Tilings using only B: BB, B - 2.
Tilings using only G: GG, G - 2.

Tilings using only R, B: RR, RB, BR, BB (from 1, 1), R, B (from 2) - 6.
Tilings using only R, G: RG, GR, RR, GG, R, G - 6.
Tilings using only B, G: BG, GB, BB, GG, B, G - 6.

Tilings using R, B, G:
Consider compositions of 2: 1+1, 2.
Case 1: 1, 1. Color pairs: (R,B), (R,G), (B,R), (B,G), (G,R), (G,B) - 6.
Case 2: 2. Colors: R, B, G - impossible to use all three.

Let's re-think the counting.

Consider the structure of a tiling as a sequence of colored tiles.
Example for $n=3$:
Lengths: (1, 1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3).

Tiling with lengths (1, 1, 1): $3^3 = 27$ colorings.
Tiling with lengths (1, 2): $3^2 = 9$ colorings.
Tiling with lengths (2, 1): $3^2 = 9$ colorings.
Tiling with lengths (3): $3^1 = 3$ colorings.
Total tilings = $27 + 9 + 9 + 3 = 48$.
Formula: $3 \cdot 4^{3-1} = 3 \cdot 16 = 48$.

Consider tilings of $n=2$.
Lengths: (1, 1), (2).
Tilings:
(1, 1): RR, RB, RG, BR, BB, BG, GR, GB, GG (9)
(2): R, B, G (3)
Total = 12.

Number of tilings using only red and blue colors for $n=2$:
Lengths: (1, 1), (2).
(1, 1): RR, RB, BR, BB (4)
(2): R, B (2)
Total = 6.
Formula: $2 \cdot 3^{2-1} = 2 \cdot 3 = 6$.

Number of tilings using only red color for $n=2$:
Lengths: (1, 1), (2).
(1, 1): RR (1)
(2): R (1)
Total = 2.
Formula: $1 \cdot 2^{2-1} = 1 \cdot 2 = 2$.

Consider tilings of $n=2$ using all three colors.
Tilings: (1 red, 1 blue), (1 red, 1 green), (1 blue, 1 red), ...
Lengths must be (1, 1).
Colorings: RB, BR, RG, GR, BG, GB. Total 6.
Formula result is 0.

The issue is that the inclusion-exclusion was applied to the colors used, not the tilings themselves.

Let $U$ be the set of all tilings. $|U| = 3 \cdot 4^{n-1}$.
Let $A'$ be the set of tilings that do not use red color.
Let $B'$ be the set of tilings that do not use blue color.
Let $G'$ be the set of tilings that do not use green color.

Consider a tiling. If it does not use red, then each tile is either blue or green.
Number of ways to color each tile is 2.
Consider a tiling with $k$ tiles. If the colors are chosen from {blue, green}, there are $2^k$ ways to color.
$|A'| = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} 2^k = 2 \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{j} 2^j = 2 \cdot 3^{n-1}$.

Consider tilings that do not use red and do not use blue. Each tile is green.
Number of ways to color each tile is 1.
$|A' \cap B'| = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} 1^k = 1 \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{j} 1^j = 1 \cdot 2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1}$.

$|A' \cap B' \cap G'|$ = tilings that use no colors, which is 0.

Number of tilings that miss at least one color = $|A' \cup B' \cup G'|$
$|A' \cup B' \cup G'| = |A'| + |B'| + |G'| - (|A' \cap B'| + |A' \cap G'| + |B' \cap G'|) + |A' \cap B' \cap G'|$
$= (2 \cdot 3^{n-1}) + (2 \cdot 3^{n-1}) + (2 \cdot 3^{n-1}) - (2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1}) + 0$
$= 3 \cdot (2 \cdot 3^{n-1}) - 3 \cdot 2^{n-1} = 6 \cdot 3^{n-1} - 3 \cdot 2^{n-1}$.

Number of tilings using all three colors = Total tilings - Number of tilings missing at least one color
$N = 3 \cdot 4^{n-1} - (6 \cdot 3^{n-1} - 3 \cdot 2^{n-1})$
$N = 3 \cdot 4^{n-1} - 6 \cdot 3^{n-1} + 3 \cdot 2^{n-1}$.

For $n=7$:
$N = 3 \cdot 4^6 - 6 \cdot 3^6 + 3 \cdot 2^6$
$N = 3 \cdot 4096 - 6 \cdot 729 + 3 \cdot 64$
$N = 12288 - 4374 + 192$
$N = 7914 + 192 = 8106$.

Remainder when $N=8106$ is divided by $1000$ is $106$.

Let's double-check the formula with $n=2$.
$N = 3 \cdot 4^1 - 6 \cdot 3^1 + 3 \cdot 2^1 = 12 - 18 + 6 = 0$. Correct.

Consider $n=3$.
$N = 3 \cdot 4^2 - 6 \cdot 3^2 + 3 \cdot 2^2 = 3 \cdot 16 - 6 \cdot 9 + 3 \cdot 4 = 48 - 54 + 12 = 6$.

Let's manually count for $n=3$.
Total tilings = 48.
Tilings missing red (using blue, green): $2 \cdot 3^{3-1} = 2 \cdot 9 = 18$.
Tilings missing blue (using red, green): 18.
Tilings missing green (using red, blue): 18.
Tilings missing red and blue (using green): $2^{3-1} = 4$.
Tilings missing red and green (using blue): 4.
Tilings missing blue and green (using red): 4.
Tilings missing red, blue, green: 0.

Number of tilings missing at least one color = $18 + 18 + 18 - (4 + 4 + 4) + 0 = 54 - 12 = 42$.
Number of tilings using all three colors = $48 - 42 = 6$.

Consider the tilings of a $3\times 1$ board using all three colors.
Compositions of 3: (1, 1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3).

Lengths (1, 1, 1): Colorings using all three: $3! = 6$. (RBG permutations)
Lengths (1, 2): Impossible to use all three colors.
Lengths (2, 1): Impossible to use all three colors.
Lengths (3): Impossible to use all three colors.

The only tilings using all three colors are those with tile lengths (1, 1, 1) and distinct colors.

The formula seems correct.

We need the remainder when $N = 8106$ is divided by $1000$.
$8106 = 8 \times 1000 + 106$.
The remainder is $106$.

$N = 3 \cdot 4^{n-1} - (6 \cdot 3^{n-1} - 3 \cdot 2^{n-1})$
$N = 3 \cdot 4^{n-1} - 6 \cdot 3^{n-1} + 3 \cdot 2^{n-1}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver performs algebraic manipulation to derive the final formula for counting tilings using all three colors. They substitute the expressions for total tilings and tilings missing at least one color, then simplify by distributing the negative sign. This demonstrates skill in manipulating algebraic expressions to obtain a final formula.</explanation>

<text>For $n=7$:
$N = 3 \cdot 4^6 - 6 \cdot 3^6 + 3 \cdot 2^6$
$N = 3 \cdot 4096 - 6 \cdot 729 + 3 \cdot 64$
$N = 12288 - 4374 + 192$
$N = 7914 + 192 = 8106$.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies their formula by applying it to the specific case of n=7, showing the step-by-step calculation. This demonstrates the skill of testing a general formula on the specific instance required by the problem.</explanation>

<text>Let's double-check the formula with $n=2$.
$N = 3 \cdot 4^1 - 6 \cdot 3^1 + 3 \cdot 2^1 = 12 - 18 + 6 = 0$. Correct.

Consider $n=3$.
$N = 3 \cdot 4^2 - 6 \cdot 3^2 + 3 \cdot 2^2 = 3 \cdot 16 - 6 \cdot 9 + 3 \cdot 4 = 48 - 54 + 12 = 6$.

Let's manually count for $n=3$.
Total tilings = 48.
Tilings missing red (using blue, green): $2 \cdot 3^{3-1} = 2 \cdot 9 = 18$.
Tilings missing blue (using red, green): 18.
Tilings missing green (using red, blue): 18.
Tilings missing red and blue (using green): $2^{3-1} = 4$.
Tilings missing red and green (using blue): 4.
Tilings missing blue and green (using red): 4.
Tilings missing red, blue, green: 0.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies their formula by testing it on small cases (n=2, n=3) and comparing with manual counting. This demonstrates the skill of verification by checking that the general formula produces the correct results for simple cases that can be counted directly.</explanation>

<text>Number of tilings missing at least one color = $18 + 18 + 18 - (4 + 4 + 4) + 0 = 54 - 12 = 42$.
Number of tilings using all three colors = $48 - 42 = 6$.

Consider the tilings of a $3\times 1$ board using all three colors.
Compositions of 3: (1, 1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3).</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies their calculation for n=3 by both applying the inclusion-exclusion formula and directly analyzing the possible tilings. This demonstrates the skill of verification through alternative methods to ensure the correctness of the solution.</explanation>
