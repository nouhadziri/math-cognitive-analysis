Problem:
The vector $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$ is rotated $90^\circ$ about the origin.  During the rotation, it passes through the $x$-axis.  Find the resulting vector.

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Note that the magnitude of the vector $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$ is $\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2}$ is 3.  Furthermore, if this vector makes an angle of $\theta$ with the positive $x$-axis, then
\[\cos \theta = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \right\| \left\|\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} = \frac{1}{3}.\]This tells us that $\theta$ is acute, so the vector passes through the positive $x$-axis at $(3,0,0).$

Let the resulting vector be $(x,y,z).$  By symmetry, $y = z.$  Also, since the magnitude of the vector is preserved,
\[x^2 + 2y^2 = 9.\]Also, since the vector is rotated by $90^\circ,$ the resulting vector is orthogonal to the original vector.  Thus,
\[\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ y \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = 0,\]which gives us $x + 4y = 0.$  Then $x = -4y.$  Substituting into $x^2 + 2y^2 = 9,$ we get
\[16y^2 + 2y^2 = 9,\]so $y^2 = \frac{1}{2}.$  Hence, $y = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ so $x = -4y = \mp 2 \sqrt{2}.$  From the geometry of the diagram, $x$ is positive and $y$ and $z$ are negative, so $x = 2 \sqrt{2}.$  Then $y = z = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$ so the resulting vector is
\[\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \sqrt{2} \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{pmatrix}}.\]
