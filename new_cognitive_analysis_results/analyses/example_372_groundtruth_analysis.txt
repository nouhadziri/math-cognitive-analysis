<explanation>The problem requires manipulating the functional equation $(x-1)P(x+1)=(x+2)P(x)$ by substituting different values of x to derive relationships between values of P at different points. This manipulation would be necessary to connect P(3) with P(7/2) using the given conditions.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver would need to substitute specific values of x (like x=1, x=2, etc.) into the functional equation to derive relationships between values of P at different points, ultimately connecting P(7/2) to the given condition that P(2)Â²=P(3).</explanation>
