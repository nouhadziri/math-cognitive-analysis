Problem:
Let's say a language  $L \subseteq \{0,1\}^*$  is in  $\textbf{P}_{angel}$  if there exists a polynomial  $p : \mathbb{N} \mapsto \mathbb{N}$ , a sequence of strings  $\{\alpha_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$  with  $\alpha_n \in \{0,1\}^{p(n)}$ , and a deterministic polynomial time Turing Machine  $M$  such that for every  $x \in \{0,1\}^n$   $$ x \in L \Leftrightarrow M(x, \alpha_n) = 1 $$  Let us call  $\alpha_n$  to be the *angel string*for all  $x$  of the length  $n$ . Note that the *angel string* is  $\textbf{not}$  similar to a *witness* or *certificate*as used in the definition of  $\textbf{NP}$  For example, all unary languages, even  $UHALT$  which is undecidable, are in  $\textbf{P}_{angel}$  because the \textit{angel string} can simply be a single bit that tells us if the given unary string is in  $UHALT$  or not.


A set  $S \subseteq \Sigma^*$  is said to be **sparse** if there exists a polynomial   $p : \mathbb{N} \mapsto \mathbb{N}$  such that for each  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , the number of strings of length  $n$  in  $S$  is bounded by  $p(n)$ . In other words,  $|S^{=n}| \leq p(n)$ , where  $S^{=n} \subseteq S$  contains all the strings in  $S$  that are of length  $n$ .

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Defining the Sparse Set \( S \) and the Turing Machine \( M \)**

   We need to construct a sparse set \( S \) and a deterministic polynomial time Turing Machine \( M \) with oracle access to \( S \) such that given an input \( \langle x, i \rangle \), the TM \( M \) will accept it if and only if \( x \in S_i \).

   - **Definition of \( S \)**:
     Define \( S \) as the set containing strings of the form \( 1^i0^{k-i}x \) where \( x \in S_i \). Formally,
     \[
     S = \{ 1^i0^{k-i}x \mid x \in S_i \text{ for some } 1 \leq i \leq k \}.
     \]

   - **Description of \( M \)**:
     Given an input \( \langle x, i \rangle \), the Turing Machine \( M \) will:
     1. Construct the string \( 1^i0^{k-i}x \).
     2. Query the oracle \( S \) to check if \( 1^i0^{k-i}x \in S \).
     3. Accept if the oracle returns "yes", otherwise reject.

   - **Proof that \( S \) is Sparse**:
     Let \( p_i(n) \) be the polynomial bounding the number of strings of length \( n \) in \( S_i \). Define \( p(n) \) as a polynomial such that \( p(n) > p_i(n) \) for all \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) and for all \( n \in \mathbb{N} \). For any \( n \geq k \), the number of strings in \( S \) of length \( n \) is bounded by \( k \cdot p(n-k) \), which is a polynomial.

2. **Equivalence of \(\textbf{P}\) and \(\textbf{P}_{bad-angel}\)**

   - **Claim**: \(\textbf{P} = \textbf{P}_{bad-angel}\).

   - **Proof**:
     If \( L \in \textbf{P}_{bad-angel} \), there exists a polynomial time algorithm \( A \) that computes the angel string \( \alpha_n \) for any length \( n \). We also have a polynomial time Turing Machine \( M' \) that decides membership in \( L \) given \( x \) and \( \alpha_n \).

     To decide \( L \) in polynomial time:
     1. Given an input \( x \), compute its length \( n \).
     2. Use the algorithm \( A \) to compute the angel string \( \alpha_n \).
     3. Simulate \( M' \) on input \( (x, \alpha_n) \).

     Since all steps are polynomial time, \( L \in \textbf{P} \). Hence, \(\textbf{P} = \textbf{P}_{bad-angel}\).

3. **Existence of Sparse Set \( S_L \) for \( L \in \textbf{P}_{angel} \)**

   - **Claim**: For any language \( L \in \textbf{P}_{angel} \), there exists a sparse set \( S_L \) and a deterministic polynomial time Turing Machine \( M \) with oracle access to \( S_L \) that can decide \( L \).

   - **Proof**:
     Let \( \{\alpha_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \) be the sequence of angel strings for \( L \). Let \( \alpha_n = a_1a_2\ldots a_{p(n)} \).

     Define \( S_L \) as the set containing prefixes of the angel strings:
     \[
     S_L = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{1^n0a_1, 1^n0a_1a_2, \ldots, 1^n0a_1a_2\ldots a_{p(n)}\}.
     \]

     - **Sparsity of \( S_L \)**:
       For each \( n \), we add \( p(n) \) strings of lengths ranging from \( n+2 \) to \( n+p(n)+1 \). The number of strings of length \( n+p(n)+1 \) is bounded by \( p(n) \), ensuring \( S_L \) is sparse.

     - **Description of \( M \)**:
       Given an input \( x \) of length \( n \):
       1. Initialize an empty string \( \alpha \).
       2. For \( i = 1 \) to \( p(n) \):
          - Query the oracle \( S_L \) with \( 1^n0\alpha a_i \).
          - If the oracle returns "yes", append \( a_i \) to \( \alpha \).
       3. Simulate the Turing Machine \( M' \) on input \( (x, \alpha) \).

     Since \( M \) makes polynomially many queries to the sparse set \( S_L \) and each query is polynomial time, \( M \) decides \( L \) in polynomial time.
