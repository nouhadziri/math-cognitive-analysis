Problem:
Andile and Zandre play a game on a  $2017 \times 2017$  board. At the beginning, Andile declares some of the squares *forbidden*, meaning the nothing may be placed on such a square. After that, they take turns to place coins on the board, with Zandre placing the first coin. It is not allowed to place a coin on a forbidden square or in the same row or column where another coin has already been placed. The player who places the last coin wins the game.

What is the least number of squares Andile needs to declare as forbidden at the beginning to ensure a win? (Assume that both players use an optimal strategy.)

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem describes a game played on a $2017 \times 2017$ board. The game involves placing coins on the board with certain restrictions. The goal is to determine the minimum number of forbidden squares Andile needs to declare to guarantee a win. This suggests that we need to find a strategy for Andile that forces a win, regardless of Zandre's moves.

The game ends when no more coins can be placed on the board according to the rules. The rules for placing a coin are:
1. The square must not be forbidden.
2. The square must not be in the same row or column as any previously placed coin.

This game is impartial, meaning the available moves depend only on the state of the game, not on which player is currently moving. Such games can often be analyzed using concepts from combinatorial game theory, particularly the Sprague-Grundy theorem, though the structure of this game might allow for a simpler analysis.

Let the size of the board be $n \times n$, where $n = 2017$.
The game proceeds by placing coins such that each coin occupies a unique row and a unique column. This implies that at most $n$ coins can be placed on the board.

Consider the state of the game as the set of rows and columns that have been "occupied" by placed coins. When a coin is placed at $(r, c)$, row $r$ and column $c$ become unavailable for future placements.

The game ends when it is impossible to place another coin. This happens when all rows or all columns have been occupied.

The player who places the last coin wins. This means the game is played until a terminal position is reached, and the winner is the player who made the last move. Such games can often be analyzed by looking at the parity of the number of moves.

If the game always ends after a fixed number of moves, the first player wins if that number is odd, and the second player wins if that number is even. However, the number of moves in this game depends on the choices made by the players.

Let the number of coins placed be $k$. Each coin occupies one row and one column. After $k$ coins have been placed, $k$ rows and $k$ columns are unavailable. The number of available rows is $n - k$, and the number of available columns is $n - k$. A new coin can be placed if there exists an available row $r$ and an available column $c$ such that the square $(r, c)$ is not forbidden.

The game can be viewed as selecting pairs of (row, column) for placing coins.

Consider the case where no squares are forbidden. The first player (Zandre) places a coin. This occupies one row and one column. The second player (Andile) then places a coin in a different row and column. The game continues until $n$ coins have been placed, at which point all rows and columns are occupied, and no more moves are possible. The total number of moves is at most $n$.

If the game ends after $m$ moves, the player who made the $m$-th move wins.

If Andile wants to ensure a win, he needs to make the total number of moves even, assuming he plays second. If Zandre plays optimally, he will try to maximize the number of moves if he starts.

Consider the game as a matching problem in a bipartite graph where one set of vertices represents rows and the other represents columns. Placing a coin corresponds to selecting an edge in the matching. The constraints imply that the matching must be such that no two edges share a vertex.

The maximum number of moves in the game is $n$. If the game always lasts $n$ moves, and Zandre starts, the moves are $Z_1, A_1, Z_2, A_2, ..., Z_k, A_k, ...$. If $n$ is odd, the last move is by Zandre; if $n$ is even, the last move is by Andile.
Since $n = 2017$ is odd, if the game always lasts $n$ moves, Zandre wins if no squares are forbidden.

Andile needs to declare some squares as forbidden to change the outcome. The goal is to reduce the maximum number of moves possible in the game.

Consider the ending condition of the game: no more coins can be placed. This happens when either all rows or all columns are blocked (either by previously placed coins or by forbidden squares).

Let the set of forbidden squares be $F$.

If Andile forbids some squares, the maximum number of coins that can be placed might be less than $n$.

Consider the case where Andile forbids $k$ squares. How does this affect the game?

Let the state of the game be represented by the set of occupied rows $R_{occ}$ and occupied columns $C_{occ}$. Initially, $R_{occ} = \emptyset$, $C_{occ} = \emptyset$.
A move consists of choosing a non-forbidden square $(r, c)$ such that $r \notin R_{occ}$ and $c \notin C_{occ}$, and adding $r$ to $R_{occ}$ and $c$ to $C_{occ}$.

The game ends when there are no such squares.

Andile wants to force the game to end after an even number of moves.

Consider a smaller board, e.g., $3 \times 3$.
If no squares are forbidden, the game lasts 3 moves, and Zandre wins.
Z places at $(r_1, c_1)$.
A places at $(r_2, c_2)$, $r_2 \neq r_1, c_2 \neq c_1$.
Z places at $(r_3, c_3)$, $r_3 \notin \{r_1, r_2\}, c_3 \notin \{c_1, c_2\}$.

If Andile forbids some squares, he can potentially limit the number of possible placements.

Consider the symmetry of the game. The roles of rows and columns are interchangeable.

If Andile forbids a set of squares, and the maximum number of placements in this modified game is $m$, then if $m$ is even, Andile wins, and if $m$ is odd, Zandre wins.

Andile moves second, so if the total number of moves is even, the last move is by Andile.

Let the number of forbidden squares be $f$. We want to find the minimum $f$ such that the maximum number of moves in the game with these forbidden squares is even.

Consider the dual problem: what is the maximum number of coins that can be placed given a set of forbidden squares? This is equivalent to finding the size of the largest matching in a bipartite graph with some edges removed (corresponding to forbidden squares).

Let the bipartite graph have vertices $R_1, ..., R_n$ and $C_1, ..., C_n$. An edge exists between $R_i$ and $C_j$ if the square $(i, j)$ is not forbidden. A matching corresponds to a set of placed coins.

The game ends when the maximum matching in the remaining subgraph is empty.

Consider the state where $k$ coins have been placed. This corresponds to a matching of size $k$. The available moves correspond to edges that can be added to the matching.

If Andile wants to win, he needs to ensure that after his move, the state of the game is such that the maximum number of additional moves possible is odd.

Consider the game ending condition: no available non-forbidden square $(r, c)$ such that row $r$ and column $c$ are not occupied.

If Andile forbids some squares, he might create a situation where the game ends prematurely.

Let the final state of the game have $m$ coins placed. The winner is the player who placed the $m$-th coin. Andile wins if $m$ is even.

Consider the case where Andile forbids squares along the main diagonal. This does not prevent placing $n$ coins.

Consider forbidding all squares in the first row. Then no coins can be placed in the first row. The game is restricted to the remaining $(n-1) \times n$ board.

If Andile forbids $k$ squares, how does it affect the maximum number of moves?

Consider the number of available rows and columns. If $k$ coins are placed, $k$ rows and $k$ columns are occupied. A new coin can be placed if there exists a non-forbidden square in the remaining $(n-k) \times (n-k)$ sub-board.

Let the set of forbidden squares be $F$.
The game ends when for every available row $r$ and available column $c$, the square $(r, c)$ is forbidden.

Consider the symmetry of the game. If a set of forbidden squares guarantees a win for Andile, then the total number of possible moves in the modified game must be even.

Consider the ending state where no more moves are possible. Let the set of occupied rows be $R_{occ}$ and occupied columns be $C_{occ}$.
For every $r \notin R_{occ}$ and $c \notin C_{occ}$, the square $(r, c)$ is forbidden.

Let $|R_{occ}| = k$, $|C_{occ}| = k$. The number of available rows is $n - k$, and the number of available columns is $n - k$.
The forbidden squares cover the $(n - k) \times (n - k)$ sub-board formed by the available rows and columns.
The number of forbidden squares must be at least $(n - k)^2$.

Consider the case where the game ends after $2m$ moves (Andile wins). The state is a matching of size $2m$. There are $n - 2m$ available rows and $n - 2m$ available columns. All squares in the $(n - 2m) \times (n - 2m)$ sub-board formed by these rows and columns must be forbidden.

If the game ends after $2m - 1$ moves (Zandre wins). The state is a matching of size $2m - 1$. There are $n - (2m - 1)$ available rows and columns. All squares in the $(n - 2m + 1) \times (n - 2m + 1)$ sub-board must be forbidden.

Andile wants to create a situation where the game cannot proceed beyond an even number of moves.

Consider the effect of forbidding squares. Each forbidden square removes a potential move.

Consider a strategy for Andile: forbid squares such that after Zandre's move, the number of remaining possible moves (or the size of the maximum matching in the remaining allowed bipartite graph) has a certain parity.

Let $n = 2017$.

If Andile forbids $n$ squares along a diagonal, does it help? No, the game can still proceed.

Consider the maximum number of moves possible in the game with forbidden squares.

If Andile forbids all squares except those in the first row and first column. The available moves are only in the first row and first column, excluding the intersection. Only one coin can be placed.

Consider the state of the board when the game ends. Let $k$ coins have been placed. The occupied rows are $r_1, ..., r_k$, and occupied columns are $c_1, ..., c_k$.
For any row $r \notin \{r_1, ..., r_k\}$ and column $c \notin \{c_1, ..., c_k\}$, the square $(r, c)$ is forbidden.

If the game ends after $2m$ moves (Andile wins), then after $2m$ coins are placed, all squares in the remaining $(n - 2m) \times (n - 2m)$ sub-board are forbidden.

If the game ends after $2m - 1$ moves (Zandre wins), then after $2m - 1$ coins are placed, all squares in the remaining $(n - 2m + 1) \times (n - 2m + 1)$ sub-board are forbidden.

Andile wants to ensure that the game ends after an even number of moves.

Consider the scenario where Andile forbids $k^2$ squares forming a $k \times k$ block in the bottom right corner.
If the game proceeds with fewer than $n - k$ moves, it might end prematurely due to these forbidden squares.

If the game reaches a state where $n - k$ coins have been placed, then there is a $(n - (n - k)) \times (n - (n - k)) = k \times k$ sub-board of available rows and columns. All squares in this $k \times k$ block are forbidden.

Consider the number of moves remaining in the game.

Let the game end after $m$ moves.
If $m$ is even, Andile wins.
If $m$ is odd, Zandre wins.

Consider the game as played on the bipartite graph. Andile removes edges. Zandre picks an edge in the remaining graph.

Let $n = 3$. If no squares are forbidden, the game lasts 3 moves, Zandre wins.
Andile needs to forbid squares such that the maximum number of moves becomes even.

Consider the dual game: given a set of allowed squares, what is the maximum number of coins that can be placed?

If these are in the same row or column, only 1 move possible.
If these are $(r_1, c_1)$ and $(r_2, c_2)$ with $r_1 \neq r_2, c_1 \neq c_2$.
Zandre places at $(r_1, c_1)$. No more moves.

Consider the case where the game can last at most $m$ moves. Andile wins if $m$ is even.

If Andile can make the set of available moves symmetric with respect to rows and columns.

Let the set of forbidden squares be $F$.
Let the set of placed coins be $P$.
Available rows: $R \setminus \{r | (r, c) \in P\}$.

If Zandre places at $(1, 2)$.
Available rows: 2, 3. Available cols: 1, 3.
Non-forbidden squares: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3).
Andile can place at $(2, 1)$.
Available rows: 3. Available cols: 3.
Non-forbidden square: $(3, 3)$.
Zandre places at $(3, 3)$. Game ends after 3 moves.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes a specific case where forbidden squares form a transversal, tracing through the entire game sequence to determine the outcome. This detailed case analysis helps identify whether certain configurations of forbidden squares can lead to Andile's victory.</explanation>

<skill>Symmetry Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify and leverage symmetrical structures or relationships in a problem, often simplifying analysis by recognizing that different configurations may be equivalent due to symmetry.</definition>
<start>4308</start>
<end>4383</end>
<text>Consider the symmetry of the game. The roles of rows and columns are interchangeable.</text>
<explanation>The solver explicitly recognizes the symmetrical nature of rows and columns in the game structure. This insight can simplify the analysis by reducing the number of cases that need to be considered separately.</explanation>

<start>9880</start>
<end>9977</end>
<text>Consider the symmetry of the board and the game.

If Andile forbids a set of squares such that the maximum number of non-attacking coins is even.</text>
<explanation>The solver again invokes symmetry considerations, recognizing that the board's symmetrical properties can be leveraged in developing a winning strategy. This demonstrates the ability to identify structural patterns that can simplify the solution approach.</explanation>

<skill>Working Backwards</skill>
<definition>The problem-solving approach that starts from the desired end state and works backwards to determine the conditions or steps needed to reach that state from the initial conditions.</definition>
<start>5152</start>
<end>5570</end>
<text>Consider the ending state where no more moves are possible. Let the set of occupied rows be $R_{occ}$ and occupied columns be $C_{occ}$.
For every $r \notin R_{occ}$ and $c \notin C_{occ}$, the square $(r, c)$ is forbidden.

Let $|R_{occ}| = k$, $|C_{occ}| = k$. The number of available rows is $n - k$, and the number of available columns is $n - k$.
The forbidden squares cover the $(n - k) \times (n - k)$ sub-board formed by the available rows and columns.
The number of forbidden squares must be at least $(n - k)^2$.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes the game's ending state and works backwards to determine what conditions must have been true about the forbidden squares. This reverse engineering approach helps identify the constraints on the solution.</explanation>

<start>10001</start>
<end>10134</end>
<text>Consider the state of the game just before the last coin is placed. If it's Andile's turn, and the number of possible next moves for Zandre is 0.</text>
<explanation>The solver examines the game state immediately before the final move, working backwards to determine what conditions would ensure Andile's victory. This demonstrates the ability to reason from desired outcomes to necessary conditions.</explanation>

<skill>Simplification</skill>
<definition>The process of reducing a complex problem to a simpler form that preserves essential features while eliminating unnecessary details, making the problem more tractable.</definition>
<start>8626</start>
<end>8719</end>
<text>Let $n = 3$. If no squares are forbidden, the game lasts 3 moves, Zandre wins.
Andile needs to forbid squares such that the maximum number of moves becomes even.</text>
<explanation>The solver simplifies the problem by considering a much smaller board (3×3 instead of 2017×2017), which preserves the essential mathematical structure while making the analysis more manageable.</explanation>

<start>10136</start>
<end>10396</end>
<text>Consider the number of "free" rows and columns.

If Andile forbids $(n-1)^2$ squares forming an $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ block.
Only the first row and first column have non-forbidden squares.
The only possible placements are $(1, j)$ and $(i, 1)$.
Zandre places at $(1, j)$.
No more moves possible. Game ends after 1 move, Zandre wins.</text>
<explanation>The solver simplifies the analysis by considering a specific configuration of forbidden squares that creates a clear structure of available moves. This simplification helps analyze the game outcome for particular strategies.</explanation>
