Problem:
A sequence  $(a_n)$  is defined recursively by  $a_1=0, a_2=1$  and for  $n\ge 3$ ,
\[a_n=\frac12na_{n-1}+\frac12n(n-1)a_{n-2}+(-1)^n\left(1-\frac{n}{2}\right).\]
Find a closed-form expression for  $f_n=a_n+2\binom{n}{1}a_{n-1}+3\binom{n}{2}a_{n-2}+\ldots +(n-1)\binom{n}{n-2}a_2+n\binom{n}{n-1}a_1$ .

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding a closed-form expression for this sequence f_n which is defined in terms of the recursive sequence a_n. The given recursive definition for a_n starts with a_1=0 and a_2=1, and for n ≥ 3, it uses that formula involving a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, and some terms with (-1)^n. Then f_n is this combination of a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., down to a_1 with coefficients that are like k multiplied by binomial coefficients. So we have to find a closed-form for f_n. Hmm.

First, maybe I should write out the definition of f_n again to make sure I have it right. It is:

f_n = a_n + 2*C(n,1)*a_{n-1} + 3*C(n,2)*a_{n-2} + ... + (n-1)*C(n,n-2)*a_2 + n*C(n,n-1)*a_1.

So the coefficients increase from 1 up to n, and the binomial coefficients C(n,k) are decreasing as k decreases? Wait, let's check the first few terms. Let's take for example n=2. Then f_2 would be a_2 + 2*C(2,1)*a_1, right? Since the terms go from a_n down to a_1. So plugging in n=2, that's a_2 + 2*2*a_1 = 1 + 4*0 = 1. For n=3, it would be a_3 + 2*C(3,1)*a_{2} + 3*C(3,2)*a_1. Let's compute that once we have a_3.

But first, perhaps it's important to understand the recursive formula for a_n. Let me compute the first few terms of a_n.

Given a_1=0, a_2=1.

For n=3:

a_3 = (1/2)*3*a_2 + (1/2)*3*2*a_1 + (-1)^3*(1 - 3/2)

Calculate step by step:

First term: (1/2)*3*1 = 3/2

Second term: (1/2)*3*2*0 = 0

Third term: (-1)^3*(1 - 3/2) = (-1)*(-1/2) = 1/2

So a_3 = 3/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 2

Similarly, for n=4:

a_4 = (1/2)*4*a_3 + (1/2)*4*3*a_2 + (-1)^4*(1 - 4/2)

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)*4*2 = 4

Second term: (1/2)*4*3*1 = 6

Third term: 1*(1 - 2) = -1

Thus, a_4 = 4 + 6 -1 = 9

a_5: n=5

a_5 = (1/2)*5*a_4 + (1/2)*5*4*a_3 + (-1)^5*(1 - 5/2)

Calculations:

First term: (5/2)*9 = 45/2 = 22.5

Second term: (1/2)*20*2 = 20*2/2 = 20

Third term: (-1)^5*(1 - 2.5) = (-1)*(-1.5) = 1.5 = 3/2

Thus, a_5 = 22.5 + 20 + 1.5 = 44

Hmm, okay. Let's check a few more terms.

a_6: n=6

a_6 = (1/2)*6*a_5 + (1/2)*6*5*a_4 + (-1)^6*(1 - 6/2)

First term: 3*44 = 132

Second term: (1/2)*30*9 = 15*9 = 135

Third term: 1*(1 - 3) = -2

So a_6 = 132 + 135 -2 = 265

So we have a_1=0, a_2=1, a_3=2, a_4=9, a_5=44, a_6=265...

Wait, these numbers seem familiar. a_2=1, a_3=2, a_4=9, a_5=44, a_6=265. Hmm, these look like numbers related to derangements or something similar. Let me check derangements:

Derangements D(n) = n!*(1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - ... + (-1)^n/n!). The first few derangement numbers are:

D(1)=0, D(2)=1, D(3)=2, D(4)=9, D(5)=44, D(6)=265. Oh, exactly the same as a_n here! So, a_n is the derangement number?

But wait, the derangement formula is D(n) = (n-1)*(D(n-1) + D(n-2)), right? But the recurrence here for a_n is similar but not exactly the same. Let me check.

Given that D(n) = (n-1)*(D(n-1) + D(n-2)), which is the standard derangement recurrence.

But in our problem, the recurrence is:

a_n = (1/2)*n*a_{n-1} + (1/2)*n(n-1)*a_{n-2} + (-1)^n*(1 - n/2)

Wait, that's different from the derangement recurrence, but the numbers we computed for a_n up to n=6 match the derangements. So perhaps this recurrence relation for a_n actually gives derangement numbers. Let me check that.

Testing n=3:

Using derangement recurrence D(3) = 2*(D(2) + D(1)) = 2*(1 + 0)=2, which matches our calculation. This recurrence isn't the standard derangement recurrence. Wait, perhaps the given recurrence is transformed into the derangement recurrence. Let's check:

For n=3,

Original recurrence:

a_3 = (1/2)*3*a_2 + (1/2)*3*2*a_1 + (-1)^3*(1 - 3/2) = (3/2)*(1) + 3*0 + (-1)*( -1/2) = 3/2 + 1/2 = 2. So that's D(3)=2.

Similarly, let me check for n=4:

Original recurrence: a_4 = (1/2)*4*a_3 + (1/2)*4*3*a_2 + (-1)^4*(1 - 2). So:

(1/2)*4*2 + (1/2)*12*1 + 1*(-1) = 4 + 6 -1 =9. D(4)=9.

Similarly n=5:

(1/2)*5*9 + (1/2)*20*2 + (-1)^5*(1 - 5/2). Which is (45/2) + 20 + (-1)*(-3/2) = 45/2 + 20 + 3/2 = (45 + 3)/2 + 20 = 48/2 + 20 =24 +20=44. Correct for D(5)=44.

So even though the recurrence is different, the numbers match derangements. Maybe the given recurrence is an alternative recurrence relation for derangements. To verify, suppose that D(n) satisfies the given recurrence for the a_n. Let's see.

Suppose that D(n) = (n/2)*D(n-1) + [n(n-1)/2]*D(n-2) + (-1)^n*(1 - n/2). Then if this is equivalent to standard derangement recurrence, they must be compatible.

The standard derangement recurrence is D(n) = (n-1)(D(n-1) + D(n-2)).

So let's see if:

(n-1)(D(n-1) + D(n-2)) = (n/2)*D(n-1) + [n(n-1)/2]*D(n-2) + (-1)^n*(1 - n/2)

Is this equality true? Let me rearrange the right-hand side.

RHS: (n/2)*D(n-1) + (n(n-1)/2)*D(n-2) + (-1)^n*(1 - n/2)

Compare with LHS: (n-1)*(D(n-1) + D(n-2)) = (n-1)D(n-1) + (n-1)D(n-2)

Therefore, equate RHS and LHS:

(n-1)D(n-1) + (n-1)D(n-2) = (n/2)D(n-1) + (n(n-1)/2)D(n-2) + (-1)^n*(1 - n/2)

Bring all terms to left:

[n-1 - n/2]D(n-1) + [n-1 - n(n-1)/2]D(n-2) - (-1)^n*(1 - n/2) =0

Compute coefficients:

Coefficient of D(n-1): (2(n-1) -n)/2=(2n -2 -n)/2=(n -2)/2

Coefficient of D(n-2): (2(n-1) -n(n-1))/2= [2(n-1) -n(n-1)]/2= (n-1)(2 -n)/2= - (n-1)(n -2)/2

Thus,

(n -2)/2 * D(n-1) - (n -1)(n -2)/2 * D(n-2) - (-1)^n*(1 -n/2)=0

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:

(n -2)D(n-1) - (n -1)(n -2)D(n-2) - (-1)^n*(2 -n)=0

So,

(n -2)[D(n-1) - (n -1)D(n-2)] + (-1)^n*(n -2)=0

Hmm. Therefore, if this holds, then (n -2)[D(n-1) - (n -1)D(n-2)] + (-1)^n*(n -2)=0

Which simplifies to, if n ≠2 (as n is at least 3):

D(n-1) - (n -1)D(n-2) = (-1)^n

But let's test this with n=3:

D(2) - 2 D(1) =1 -0=1. (-1)^3= -1. So 1 ≠ -1. Here, contradiction. So either the recurrence is different, or there is some error. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait when n=3:

LHS was D(n-1) - (n-1)D(n-2)= D(2) -2 D(1)=1 -0=1

RHS of the above equation would be (-1)^n= -1. So 1 ≠ -1, which would imply the equality does not hold.

Thus, the original equality between standard derangement recurrence and the given recurrence here does not hold for n=3. But even though, we know from the computed terms that the numbers here correspond to derangements. So there must be a flaw in my assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the given recurrence does yield derangement numbers, but for n≥3. Wait, when we computed a_3 using the given recurrence, it did equal D(3)=2, and the standard derangement recurrence for n=3: D(3)=2*(D(2)+D(1))=2*(1+0)=2, which is correct.

But from the above algebra, when trying to equate the given recurrence to the standard recurrence, for n=3, it resulted in an inconsistency, so perhaps the given a_n is not equal to D(n). But yet numerically, for the first few terms, a_n equals D(n). So confusing.

Wait, here's the thing: maybe both recurrences hold. Suppose that, for n ≥3, while standard derangement recurrence is D(n) = (n-1)(D(n-1)+D(n-2)), and with the same starting values. Then the given recurrence here also produces D(n). So maybe despite differing forms, they are equivalent.

Let me check for n=3:

Given recurrence: a_3 = (1/2)*3*a_2 + (1/2)*3*2*a_1 + (-1)^3*(1 - 3/2)= (3/2)+0 + ( -1)*(-1/2)=3/2 +1/2=2.

Standard derangement: (3-1)*(a_2 +a_1)=2*(1+0)=2. Correct.

Similarly for n=4:

Given recurrence: a_4= (1/2)*4*a3 + (1/2)*4*3*a2 + (-1)^4*(1-4/2)= (4/2)*2 + (12/2)*1 +1*(-1)=4 +6 -1=9

Standard derangement: (4-1)*(a3 +a2)=3*(2 +1)=9. Correct.

Similarly for n=5:

Given a5=(5/2)*a4 + (1/2)*20*a3 + (-1)^5*(1 -5/2)= (5/2)*9 +10*2 + (-1)*(-3/2)=45/2 +20 +3/2= (45+3)/2 +20=24 +20=44. Standard derangement: 4*(9 + 2)=4*11=44.

Therefore, even though the given recurrence seems different, perhaps it's equivalent? Let me see for general n.

Let’s suppose D(n)=a_n, as per computed numbers, then let's verify the given recurrence.

We need to check if D(n)=n/2*D(n-1)+ (n(n-1)/2)*D(n-2)+ (-1)^n*(1 -n/2).

But from the standard recurrence D(n) = (n-1)(D(n-1)+ D(n-2)).

Therefore, let's see whether (n-1)(D(n-1)+ D(n-2))= n/2*D(n-1)+ (n(n-1)/2)*D(n-2)+ (-1)^n*(1 -n/2).

So bringing all terms to left:

(n-1)D(n-1) + (n-1)D(n-2) -n/2 D(n-1)-n(n-1)/2 D(n-2) - (-1)^n*(1 -n/2)=0.

Factor the terms:

[ (n-1) -n/2 ] D(n-1) + [ (n-1) -n(n-1)/2 ] D(n-2) - (-1)^n*(1 -n/2)=0.

Simplify coefficients:

First coefficient: (2(n-1) -n)/2= (2n-2 -n)/2=(n-2)/2.

Second coefficient: (n-1)(1 -n/2).

Wait,

[ (n-1) -n(n-1)/2 ]= (n-1)(1 -n/2 )

Therefore, expression becomes:

(n-2)/2 D(n-1) + (n-1)(1 -n/2) D(n-2) - (-1)^n*(1 -n/2)=0.

Hmm, this looks complicated. Maybe instead try expressing it in terms of known derangement identities.

The derangement numbers also satisfy D(n) = n*D(n-1) + (-1)^n, which is another known recurrence. Let me check that for n=3:

3*D(2) + (-1)^3= 3*1 -1=2=D(3). Yes. For n=4:4*D(3) + (-1)^4=4*2+1=9. Correct. So that one holds. Perhaps using that recurrence, substitute into the given one.

Given that a_n = (n/2)*a_{n-1} + (n(n-1)/2)*a_{n-2} + (-1)^n*(1 -n/2).

But using the recurrence D(n) = n D(n-1) + (-1)^n.

If we replace a_n with D(n), does this hold?

Check for n=3: Is 2= (3/2)*1 + (3*2/2)*0 + (-1)^3*(1-3/2)? Which is same as above, gives 2=3/2 +0 + (-1)*(-1/2)=3/2 +1/2=2. Correct.

Similarly for n=4: 9=(4/2)*9 + (4*3/2)*1 + (-1)^4*(1 -2). Hold on: (4/2)*9?? Wait, 4/2 is 2*9=18, (4*3/2)*1=6, then 1*(1 -2)=-1. But 18 +6 -1=23, which is not 9. Wait something's wrong here.

Wait no, n in the recurrence relation is the current term. So if n=4, then a_{n}=9, and the formula is (1/2)*4*a3 + (1/2)*4*3*a2 + (-1)^4*(1 -4/2). So (1/2)*4*2=4, (1/2)*12*1=6, (+1)*(1-2)= -1. Sum is 4 +6 -1=9. Correct. So the formula holds.

But if I use the alternative recurrence D(n) = n D(n-1) + (-1)^n, then substitute into the given expression.

Suppose that:

Given expression: (n/2) D(n-1) + (n(n-1)/2) D(n-2) + (-1)^n*(1 -n/2) = D(n)

But using D(n) =n D(n-1) + (-1)^n.

So substitute RHS:

Left-hand side (expression) = (n/2) D(n-1) + (n(n-1)/2) D(n-2) + (-1)^n*(1 -n/2)

= (n/2) D(n-1) + (n(n-1)/2) D(n-2) + (-1)^n - (-1)^n (n/2)

But D(n) =n D(n-1) + (-1)^n.

Thus, putting together, we have:

Expression = (n/2) D(n-1) + (n(n-1)/2) D(n-2) + (-1)^n - (n/2)(-1)^n

But from another recurrence, the standard derangement: D(n)=n D(n-1)+(-1)^n. So we can use others to substitute perhaps. Alternatively, for substitution.

If we use D(n-1) = (n-1) D(n-2) + (-1)^{n-1}

Then,

Expression = (n/2)[(n-1) D(n-2) + (-1)^{n-1}] + (n(n-1)/2) D(n-2) + (-1)^n - (n/2)(-1)^n

= [n(n-1)/2 D(n-2) + (n/2)(-1)^{n-1}] + n(n-1)/2 D(n-2) + (-1)^n - (n/2)(-1)^n

= [n(n-1)/2 D(n-2) + n(n-1)/2 D(n-2)] + (n/2)(-1)^{n-1} + (-1)^n - (n/2)(-1)^n

= n(n-1) D(n-2) + (n/2)(-1)^{n-1} + (-1)^n - (n/2)(-1)^n

Simplify the terms:

(-1)^n = (-1)*(-1)^{n-1}, so:

n(n-1) D(n-2) + [ (n/2)(-1)^{n-1} - (n/2)(-1)^n + (-1)^n ]

= n(n-1) D(n-2) + [ (n/2)(-1)^{n-1} + (-1)^n(1 - n/2) ]

Hmm. Not sure if this leads us anywhere. Let's recall that another derangement recurrence is D(n) = (n-1)(D(n-1)+D(n-2)), so perhaps substitute D(n-1) from that.

Alternatively, if D(n) =n D(n-1) + (-1)^n, then can we write D(n-1)= (n-1) D(n-2) + (-1)^{n-1}

Plugging into D(n):

D(n)=n[(n-1) D(n-2) + (-1)^{n-1}] + (-1)^n =n(n-1) D(n-2) +n (-1)^{n-1} + (-1)^n

= n(n-1) D(n-2) -n (-1)^n + (-1)^n

= n(n-1) D(n-2) + (-1)^n ( -n +1 )

Therefore,

D(n) -n(n-1) D(n-2) = (-1)^n ( -n +1 )

But according to the given recurrence,

D(n) = (n/2) D(n-1) + (n(n-1)/2) D(n-2) + (-1)^n (1 -n/2 )

Thus,

(n/2) D(n-1) + (n(n-1)/2) D(n-2) + (-1)^n (1 -n/2 )= D(n)

From above,

D(n)=n(n-1) D(n-2) + (-1)^n ( -n +1 )

Setting equal,

n(n-1) D(n-2) + (-1)^n (-n +1 ) = (n/2) D(n-1) + (n(n-1)/2) D(n-2) + (-1)^n (1 - n/2 )

Simplify:

Left side: n(n-1) D(n-2) + (-1)^n (-n +1 )

Right side: (n/2) D(n-1) + (n(n-1)/2) D(n-2) + (-1)^n (1 -n/2 )

Subtract right side from left side:

n(n-1) D(n-2) - (n(n-1)/2) D(n-2) - (n/2)D(n-1) + (-n +1)(-1)^n - (1 -n/2)(-1)^n

Simplify term by term:

Term 1: [n(n-1) - n(n-1)/2] D(n-2) = (n(n-1)/2) D(n-2)

Term 2: - (n/2) D(n-1)

Term 3: [(-n +1) - (1 -n/2)] (-1)^n = [ -n +1 -1 +n/2 ] (-1)^n = ( -n + n/2 ) (-1)^n = (-n/2) (-1)^n = (n/2) (-1)^{n+1}

Thus overall:

Left - Right = (n(n-1)/2) D(n-2) - (n/2) D(n-1) + (n/2)(-1)^{n+1} =0

Multiply through by 2:

n(n-1) D(n-2) -n D(n-1) +n (-1)^{n+1} =0

Divide by n:

(n-1) D(n-2) - D(n-1) + (-1)^{n+1} =0

Rearrange:

(n-1) D(n-2) - D(n-1) = - (-1)^{n+1} = (-1)^{n+2}= (-1)^n

But according to the recurrence D(n) = (n-1)(D(n-1)+D(n-2)), which for n replaced by n-1 gives D(n-1) = (n-2)(D(n-2)+D(n-3)).

But that might not be helpful. Alternatively, if we use another recurrence D(n-1) = (n-1) D(n-2) + (-1)^{n-1} from the recurrence D(n) =n D(n-1)+ (-1)^n, then substitute:

(n-1) D(n-2) - D(n-1) + (-1)^{n+1} =0

Thus,

(n-1) D(n-2) - [ (n-1) D(n-2) + (-1)^{n-1} ] + (-1)^{n+1} )=0

= (n-1) D(n-2) - (n-1) D(n-2) + (-1)^{n} + (-1)^{n+1} )=0

Because - (-1)^{n-1}= (-1)^n and +(-1)^{n+1} is - (-1)^n. Thus,

0 + (-1)^n - (-1)^n =0. Hence, 0=0.

Thus the equation holds. Therefore, the given recurrence is compatible with D(n) =n D(n-1) + (-1)^n. Hence, even though the recurrences look different, they result in the same sequence when starting from the same initial conditions. That is, the recurrence given in the problem results in the derangement numbers, and hence a_n = D(n) = the number of derangements of n elements.

Therefore, since f_n is defined in terms of a_n which are derangement numbers, we need to find a closed-form expression for f_n.

Given f_n = a_n + 2*C(n,1)*a_{n-1} +3*C(n,2)* a_{n-2} + ... +n*C(n,n−1)*a_1.

First, let's note that C(n,k) = binomial coefficients, so C(n,k)=n choose k.

The general term is (k+1)*C(n,k)*a_{n -k} for k from 0 to n-1. Wait let's check:

When term for a_n: that would be k=0, since n -k = n, so k=0. But (k+1)*C(n,0)*a_n =1*1*a_n=a_n, correct.

Similarly, the next term: k=1: (1+1)*C(n,1)*a_{n-1}=2*C(n,1)*a_{n-1}, which is the second term. The last term is k=n-1: (n-1 +1)*C(n,n-1)*a_1 =n*C(n,n-1)*a_1. So yes, k ranges from0 to n-1.

Therefore, f_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (k +1) C(n,k) a_{n -k}.

But since a_{n -k} is the derangement number D(n -k). So f_n sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (k +1) C(n,k) D(n -k).

We need to find a closed-form for this sum.

Given that, maybe there is a combinatorial interpretation. Let me think.

Derangement numbers count permutations with no fixed points. The binomial coefficients C(n,k) count subsets of size k. The term (k+1) could be interpreted as something... Maybe the sum can be related to some operation on permutations or generating functions.

Alternatively, use generating functions. Let me recall that the exponential generating function for derangements is G(x)= e^{-x}/(1 -x). But not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, note that a(n) = D(n), and perhaps relate f_n to n! or other known sequences.

Alternatively, notice that f_n resembles the sum involving differentiated generating functions.

Wait, note that n derangements are related to permutations, and binomial coefficients multiplied by derangements might have a relation. Alternatively, recall that in generating functions, the generating function for derangements is G(x)= sum_{n=0}^\infty D(n) x^n /n! = e^{-x}/(1 -x).

Also the generating function for f_n is sum_{n=0}^\infty f_n x^n /n! Let's see.

But since f_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (k+1) C(n,k) D(n -k). C(n,k)=n!/(k! (n −k)!)

Thus, f_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (k +1) n!/(k! (n -k)! ) D(n -k)

= n! sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (k +1)/ (k! (n -k)! ) D(n -k)

Wait, writing m =n -k, so k =n -m, when k=0, m=n; k=1, m=n-1,..., k=n-1, m=1.

Thus,

f_n= n! sum_{m=1}^n (n -m +1)/ ( (n -m)! m! ) D(m )

= n! sum_{m=1}^n (n -m +1)/ ( (n -m)! m! ) D(m )

= n! sum_{m=1}^n [ (n -m +1) D(m) ] / [ (n -m)! m! ) ]

But not sure.

Alternatively, recognize the sum as a convolution. Since f_n is sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (k +1) C(n,k) D(n −k). It resembles the convolution of sequences, multiplied by (k+1). Convolutions often relate to products of generating functions.

Given that, the generating function of f_n might be related to the product of generating functions for (k +1) and the generating functions for C(n,k) D(n -k}. Wait, but it's a weighted convolution.

Alternatively, note that k +1 = (n -k) + (k +1) -n +k no, that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, consider that  C(n,k)*(k +1) = C(n,k)*(k +1). C(n,k)*(k +1) = C(n,k)*k + C(n,k). But C(n,k)*k= n C(n−1,k−1), Hence:

sum_{k=0}^{n−1} (k +1) C(n,k) D_{n -k} = sum_{k=0}^{n−1} [ C(n,k) + k C(n,k) ] D_{n -k}

= sum_{k=0}^{n−1} C(n,k) D_{n -k} + sum_{k=0}^{n−1} k C(n,k) D_{n -k}

Then, split into two sums:

First: sum_{k=0}^{n−1} C(n,k) D_{n−k}

Second: sum_{k=0}^{n−1} k C(n,k) D_{n−k}

Note that the first sum, S1 = sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n,k) D_{n−k} - C(n,n) D(0). But D(0)=1; the number of derangements of 0 elements is 1.

But S1 in our problem is up to k=n-1, so missing term is k=n: Cn,n)=1, D0=1. So S1 as per problem would be sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n,k) D_{n−k} -1.

Similarly, consider the generating function for S = sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) D(n−k). This is similar to the binomial convolution of derangements with the sequence 1. Generating functions: the exponential generating function (EGF) for derangements is e^{-x}/(1−x). The EGF for the sequence C(n,k) would be... Hmm. Wait, the ordinary generating function (OGF) for fixed n the sum over k isn't straightforward. Wait, S for fixed n would sum over k C(n,k) D_{n−k}. If we take the generating function for D_m as G(x)= sum_{m=0}^\infty D_m x^m /m! = e^{-x}/(1 - x). So then sum_{k=0}^n n! / (k! (n -k)! ) D_{n−k} = n! sum_{k=0}^n (D_{n−k} / (n -k)! )) * (1/k! ). That would correspond to the coefficient of x^n in the product of G(x) (which is sum_{m=0}^\infty D_m x^m / m! ) and sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k /k! = e^x. Thus, sum_{n=0}^\infty [ sum_{k=0}^n D_k /k! * 1/(n -k)! ) ] x^n }= G(x) e^x= e^{-x}/(1 −x) e^x=1/(1 -x).

Therefore, the coefficient of x^n /n! is sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) D_k = n!.

But actually,

sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) D_{n -k}= sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) D_k.

Wait, but in our previous calc:

G(x) e^x=1/(1 -x), then sum_{m=0}^\infty (\sum_{k=0}^m D_k /k! *1/(m -k)! )) x^m =1/(1 -x)

Therefore, the coefficient of x^m is sum_{k=0}^m D_k /k! *1/(m -k)! ) = [x^m] 1/(1 -x)=1. Hmmm.

Wait that suggests that sum_{k=0}^m D_k / (k! (m -k)! ) )= 1/(1 -x). Wait, maybe I messed up. Wait the generating functions in exponential terms:

If G(x)= sum_{k=0}^\infty D_k x^k /k! = e^{-x}/(1 -x), and similarly H(x)=sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k /k! =e^x. Then the product G(x) H(x)= e^{-x}/(1 -x) * e^x=1/(1 -x).

But 1/(1 -x) is sum_{m=0}^\infty x^m. Therefore, in generating function terms,

sum_{m=0}^\infty [ sum_{k=0}^m D_k /k! * 1/(m -k)! ) ]x^m=1/(1 -x). But the coefficient of x^m in 1/(1 -x) is1.

Therefore, sum_{k=0}^m D_k / (k! (m -k)! ))=1.

Multiplying both sides by m!:

sum_{k=0}^m D_k * m! /(k! (m -k)! ))= m! → sum_{k=0}^m C(m,k) D_k= m!

Therefore, S1= sum_{k=0}^m C(m,k) D_k= m! → in our case, sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) D_{n−k}= sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) D_k= n! Hence, the original sum S1 (sum_{k=0}^{n−1} C(n,k) D_{n -k}) = sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) D_{n -k} - C(n,n) D_0= n! -1*1= n! -1.

Thus, the first sum in our expression is (n! -1).

Now the second sum is sum_{k=0}^{n−1} k C(n,k) D_{n−k}

Notice that k C(n,k)=n C(n−1, k−1). So we have:

sum_{k=0}^{n−1} n C(n−1, k−1) D_{n−k}=n sum_{k=0}^{n−1} C(n−1, k−1) D_{n -k}.

Let’s change variables. Let m=k−1. Then when k=0, m=−1; but since m≥0, that term is zero (C(n−1, −1)=0). So sum becomes n*sum_{m=0}^{n−2} C(n−1, m) D_{n−1 -m}.

Again, this is of the form similar to the previous sum.

Using the same logic as before: sum_{m=0}^{n−1} C(n−1, m) D_{(n−1) -m}= (n−1)!.

Hence, sum_{m=0}^{n−2} C(n−1, m) D_{(n−1)-m}= (n−1)! − C(n−1, n−1) D0= (n−1)! -1*1= (n -1)! -1.

Therefore, sum_{k=0}^{n−1} k C(n,k) D_{n−k} = n [ (n−1)! -1 ]=n! -n.

Therefore, combining the two sums:

f_n= (n! -1) + (n! -n)=2n! -n -1.

Wait, this would imply that f_n=2n! -n -1. Let me confirm with n=2,3,4.

Compute f_2:

Using original definition,f_2= a_2 +2*C(2,1)a_1=1 +2*2*0=1.

If formula gives 2*2! -2 -1=4 -2 -1=1. Correct.

n=3:

Original definition,f_3= a_3 +2*C(3,1)*a_2 +3*C(3,2)a1=2 +2*3*1 +3*3*0=2 +6 +0=8.

Formula:2*3! -3 -1=12 -4=8. Correct.

n=4:

Computed a4=9.

f_4= a4 +2*C(4,1)a3 +3*C(4,2)a2 +4*C(4,3)a1=9 +2*4*2 +3*6*1 +4*4*0=9 +16 +18 + 0=43.

Formula:2*4! -4 -1=48 -5=43. Correct. Check n=1:

But start with n=1. f_1 would be a1 +2*C(1,1)a0+... But wait a_0 isn't defined. Since the initial term starts at a_1=0. However according to defining formula:

For n=1, the terms would go from a_1 down to a_1? Probably f_1 is just a_1, which is 0. Our formula would have 2*1! -1 -1=2-1-1=0. So yes matches.

Thus, through these computations, we can see that the formula f_n=2*n! -n -1 works.

Therefore, the closed-form expression is 2n! −n −1.

But wait, answer should be in a box. The problem didn't specify n≥1 but starting at n=1 with a1=0. Anyway, the formula is generally valid for n≥1, giving 2n! −n −1.

Therefore, boxed answer:

\boxed{2n! - n -1}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2n! - n -1}

<end>9051</end>
<text>If we take the generating function for D_m as G(x)= sum_{m=0}^\infty D_m x^m /m! = e^{-x}/(1 - x). So then sum_{k=0}^n n! / (k! (n -k)! ) D_{n−k} = n! sum_{k=0}^n (D_{n−k} / (n -k)! )) * (1/k! ). That would correspond to the coefficient of x^n in the product of G(x) (which is sum_{m=0}^\infty D_m x^m / m! ) and sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k /k! = e^x. Thus, sum_{n=0}^\infty [ sum_{k=0}^n D_k /k! * 1/(n -k)! ) ] x^n }= G(x) e^x= e^{-x}/(1 −x) e^x=1/(1 -x).</text>

= sum_{k=0}^{n−1} C(n,k) D_{n -k} + sum_{k=0}^{n−1} k C(n,k) D_{n -k}

Then, split into two sums:</text>
<explanation>The solver decomposes the complex sum by splitting the coefficient (k+1) into two parts (1 and k), resulting in two separate sums that are easier to analyze individually. This demonstrates the ability to break down a complex expression into more manageable components.</explanation>

<start>9657</start>
<end>9878</end>
<text>Therefore, sum_{k=0}^{n−1} k C(n,k) D_{n−k} = n [ (n−1)! -1 ]=n! -n.

Therefore, combining the two sums:

f_n= (n! -1) + (n! -n)=2n! -n -1.

Wait, this would imply that f_n=2n! -n -1.</text>
<explanation>After solving each decomposed part separately, the solver recombines the results to obtain the final closed-form expression.

For n=3:

a_3 = (1/2)*3*a_2 + (1/2)*3*2*a_1 + (-1)^3*(1 - 3/2)

Calculate step by step:

First term: (1/2)*3*1 = 3/2

Second term: (1/2)*3*2*0 = 0

Third term: (-1)^3*(1 - 3/2) = (-1)*(-1/2) = 1/2

So a_3 = 3/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 2</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates recursive thinking by methodically applying the recurrence relation to compute a_3 from the previously known values a_1 and a_2. They break down each term in the recurrence and combine them to find the next value in the sequence.</explanation>

<start>1418</start>
<end>1630</end>
<text>So, a_n is the derangement number?

But wait, the derangement formula is D(n) = (n-1)*(D(n-1) + D(n-2)), right? But the recurrence here for a_n is similar but not exactly the same. Let me check.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that while the computed values match derangement numbers, the recurrence relation given in the problem differs from the standard derangement recurrence. This shows recursive thinking in analyzing and comparing different recursive definitions that produce the same sequence.</explanation>
