*1977 Keio University entrance exam/Medicine*

Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let the given equation be
\[\int_0^x \sin t \cdot f(x-t)dt=f(x)-\sin x \quad (*).\]
The integral on the left side is a convolution of two functions, $\sin t$ and $f(x)$. Let $g(t) = \sin t$. Then the left side is $(g * f)(x)$.
We can use Laplace transform to solve this integral equation.
Let $F(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f(x)\}(s)$ and $G(s) = \mathcal{L}\{\sin x\}(s)$.
The Laplace transform of the convolution is the product of the Laplace transforms of the individual functions.
$\mathcal{L}\left\{\int_0^x \sin t \cdot f(x-t)dt\right\} = \mathcal{L}\{(\sin * f)(x)\} = \mathcal{L}\{\sin x\} \cdot \mathcal{L}\{f(x)\} = G(s)F(s)$.
We know that $\mathcal{L}\{\sin x\} = \frac{1}{s^2+1}$.
Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation (*), we get
\[\mathcal{L}\left\{\int_0^x \sin t \cdot f(x-t)dt\right\} = \mathcal{L}\{f(x)-\sin x\}\]
\[G(s)F(s) = F(s) - G(s)\]
\[\frac{1}{s^2+1}F(s) = F(s) - \frac{1}{s^2+1}\]
Multiply by $s^2+1$ on both sides:
\[F(s) = (s^2+1)F(s) - 1\]
\[1 = (s^2+1)F(s) - F(s)\]
\[1 = F(s)(s^2+1-1)\]
\[1 = F(s)s^2\]
\[F(s) = \frac{1}{s^2}\]
Now we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of $F(s) = \frac{1}{s^2}$.
We know that $\mathcal{L}\{x\} = \frac{1}{s^2}$.
So, $f(x) = x$.

Let's verify if $f(x) = x$ is the solution.
Substitute $f(x) = x$ into the original equation:
\[\int_0^x \sin t \cdot f(x-t)dt = \int_0^x \sin t \cdot (x-t)dt\]
\[= \int_0^x (x \sin t - t \sin t)dt\]
\[= x \int_0^x \sin t dt - \int_0^x t \sin t dt\]
\[= x [-\cos t]_0^x - [-t \cos t + \int 1 \cdot \cos t dt]_0^x\]
\[= x (-\cos x - (-\cos 0)) - [-t \cos t + \sin t]_0^x\]
\[= x (1 - \cos x) - (-x \cos x + \sin x - (0 \cdot \cos 0 + \sin 0))\]
\[= x - x \cos x + x \cos x - \sin x\]
\[= x - \sin x\]
We want this to be equal to $f(x) - \sin x$.
$f(x) - \sin x = x - \sin x$.
So, the equation holds.

Final check of calculations:
$\int t \sin t dt$
Use integration by parts: $\int u dv = uv - \int v du$.
Let $u = t$, $dv = \sin t dt$. Then $du = dt$, $v = -\cos t$.
$\int t \sin t dt = t(-\cos t) - \int (-\cos t) dt = -t \cos t + \int \cos t dt = -t \cos t + \sin t + C$.
So, $[-t \cos t + \sin t]_0^x = (-x \cos x + \sin x) - (-0 \cos 0 + \sin 0) = -x \cos x + \sin x$.

The steps for solving the problem are:
1. Recognize the convolution integral on the left side.
2. Apply Laplace transform to both sides of the equation.
3. Use the property that the Laplace transform of a convolution is the product of the Laplace transforms.
4. Solve the resulting algebraic equation for $F(s)$.
5. Find the inverse Laplace transform of $F(s)$ to get $f(x)$.
6. Verify the solution by substituting it back into the original equation.
