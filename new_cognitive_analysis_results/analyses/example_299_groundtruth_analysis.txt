Problem:
A bored student walks down a hall that contains a row of closed lockers, numbered 1 to 1024. He opens the locker numbered 1, and then alternates between skipping and opening each locker thereafter. When he reaches the end of the hall, the student turns around and starts back. He opens the first closed locker he encounters, and then alternates between skipping and opening each closed locker thereafter. The student continues wandering back and forth in this manner until every locker is open. What is the number of the last locker he opens?

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify regularities, sequences, or relationships in data, often leading to the discovery of rules or formulas that explain observed phenomena.</definition>

<text>342</text>
<explanation>The solution "342" suggests that the solver recognized a pattern in how the lockers would be opened through the student's back-and-forth movement. Arriving at this specific number requires understanding the pattern of which lockers remain closed after each pass and identifying which one would be opened last.</explanation>

<skill>Logical Reasoning</skill>
<definition>The process of using structured thinking to draw valid conclusions from given information, often involving if-then relationships and deductive reasoning.</definition>

<text>342</text>
<explanation>To arrive at the answer of 342, the solver needed to apply logical reasoning to track which lockers would be open or closed after each pass of the student through the hallway. This requires understanding how the rules (opening every other closed locker) would affect the state of the lockers over multiple passes.</explanation>

<skill>Number Theory Knowledge</skill>
<definition>Understanding properties of numbers, particularly related to divisibility, factors, and number sequences that allow for identification of mathematical patterns.</definition>

<text>342</text>
<explanation>The solution suggests knowledge of number theory concepts, as the solver likely needed to understand how the pattern of opening lockers relates to powers of 2. The solution 342 indicates they recognized that lockers with indices that are powers of 2 would have special properties in this sequential opening process.</explanation>

<skill>Algorithmic Thinking</skill>
<definition>The ability to develop and follow a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem, often involving iteration and conditional logic.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>342</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrated algorithmic thinking by mentally simulating the process described in the problem - the back-and-forth movement of the student and the alternating pattern of opening lockers. They likely created a mental algorithm to track which lockers would remain closed after each pass.</explanation>

<skill>Binary Number System Understanding</skill>
<definition>Knowledge of how numbers can be represented in base-2 (binary) system and understanding the properties of powers of 2.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>342</text>
<explanation>The solution 342 suggests the solver recognized that this problem relates to binary representation. The pattern of opening lockers would follow a sequence related to powers of 2, and the solver likely used this understanding to determine which locker would be opened last.</explanation>

<skill>Mathematical Modeling</skill>
<definition>The process of translating a real-world scenario into mathematical terms, creating a representation that captures essential features of the problem.</definition>
<start>0</start>
<end>3</end>
<text>342</text>
<explanation>The solver created a mathematical model of the student's movement and the locker-opening process. They translated the verbal description into a mathematical framework that allowed them to determine which locker would be opened last.</explanation>
