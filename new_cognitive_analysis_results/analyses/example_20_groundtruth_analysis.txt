<explanation>The solver demonstrates understanding of the mathematical notation σ(a) which represents the sum of positive integer divisors of a. They also understand how to interpret the problem statement involving σ(a^n)-1 being divisible by 2021, and what it means to find the sum of prime factors in a prime factorization.

<explanation>The solver must have applied significant number theory knowledge to arrive at this answer. The problem involves the divisor sum function σ(a^n), divisibility by 2021, and prime factorization. To reach the answer of 125, they would need to understand properties of the divisor sum function, how it behaves with powers, and how to find the minimal n that satisfies the divisibility condition for all positive integers a.</explanation>

<text>125</text>
<explanation>The solver has arrived at the specific value 125 without showing extensive calculations. This suggests they used efficient number-theoretic techniques to determine that the sum of prime factors in the prime factorization of n is 125. Given the complexity of the problem, a brute force approach would be impractical, so the solver likely used theoretical shortcuts and properties of the divisor sum function.</explanation>

<start>0</start>
<end>125</end>
<text>125</text>
<explanation>To arrive at the answer 125, the solver would need to recognize patterns in how σ(a^n)-1 behaves for different values of a and n, especially in relation to divisibility by 2021. They would need to identify which values of n make σ(a^n)-1 divisible by 2021 for all positive integers a, which requires recognizing patterns in the behavior of the divisor sum function.</explanation>

<text>125</text>
<explanation>The problem explicitly asks for the sum of prime factors in the prime factorization of n. The answer 125 suggests the solver determined the value of n first, then found its prime factorization, and finally calculated the sum of these prime factors. This demonstrates skill in factorizing numbers and working with these factorizations.</explanation>
