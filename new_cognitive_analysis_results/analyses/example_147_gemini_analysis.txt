Problem:
In hyperdrive, Spaceship-0 is relativistically moving at the velocity $\frac{1}{3} c$ with respect to reference frame $R_{1}$, as measured by Spaceship-1. Spaceship-1 is moving at $\frac{1}{2} c$ with respect to reference frame $R_{2}$, as measured by Spaceship-2. Spaceship- $k$ is moving at speed $v_{k}=\frac{k+1}{k+3} c$ with respect to reference frame $R_{k+1}$. The speed of Spaceship-0 with respect to reference frame $R_{20}$ can be expressed as a decimal fraction of the speed of light which has only $x$ number of 9 s following the decimal point (i.e., in the form of $0 . \underbrace{99 \ldots 9}_{x \text { times }} c)$. Find the value of $x$.

The problem asks for the relativistic velocity addition of multiple velocities. We are given a sequence of relative velocities between different spaceships and reference frames.

Let $v_{A/B}$ denote the velocity of object A with respect to reference frame B. The relativistic velocity addition formula for the velocity of object A with respect to reference frame C, given the velocity of A with respect to B ($v_{A/B}$) and the velocity of B with respect to C ($v_{B/C}$), is:
$$v_{A/C} = \frac{v_{A/B} + v_{B/C}}{1 + \frac{v_{A/B} v_{B/C}}{c^2}}$$

We are given the following information:
- Velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_{1}$: $v_{0/R_1} = \frac{1}{3} c$.
- Velocity of Spaceship-1 with respect to $R_{2}$: $v_{1/R_2} = \frac{1}{2} c$.
- Velocity of Spaceship-k with respect to $R_{k+1}$: $v_{k/R_{k+1}} = \frac{k+1}{k+3} c$.

We need to find the velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to reference frame $R_{20}$.

Let the velocity of Spaceship-i with respect to reference frame $R_{j}$ be $v_{i,j}$.

The velocity of Spaceship-0 is measured relative to a chain of reference frames. The chain is:
Spaceship-0 relative to $R_1$
Spaceship-1 relative to $R_2$
Spaceship-k relative to $R_{k+1}$

We need to relate the reference frames. Assume that Spaceship-i is at rest in reference frame $R_i$.

The velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_1$ is given.

Consider the velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_2$. We can use the velocity addition formula with Spaceship-0 as the object and $R_1, R_2$ as the reference frames.
Let object A be Spaceship-0, frame B be $R_1$, and frame C be $R_2$.
We need the velocity of $R_1$ with respect to $R_2$.

The problem statement seems to imply that the relative velocities are between the spaceships and the reference frames, and the spaceships are used to measure these velocities. Let's interpret the movement of reference frames based on the motion of the measuring spaceships.

Interpretation 1: Reference frame $R_k$ moves with Spaceship-k.
If $R_1$ moves with Spaceship-1, then $v_{0/R_2}$ involves the velocity of $R_1$ relative to $R_2$.

Interpretation 2: The velocities are relative velocities between consecutive reference frames.
$v_{0/R_1}$ is the velocity of the origin of $R_1$ as observed from Spaceship-0.
$v_{1/R_2}$ is the velocity of the origin of $R_2$ as observed from Spaceship-1.

Let's assume the standard interpretation where the relative velocity is between the object and the reference frame.

Velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_1$: $v_{0,1} = \frac{1}{3} c$.

Velocity of Spaceship-1 with respect to $R_2$: $v_{1,2} = \frac{1}{2} c$.

The velocity of Spaceship-k with respect to $R_{k+1}$: $v_{k, k+1} = \frac{k+1}{k+3} c$.

We need the velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_{20}$.

Let $u = v_{0,1} = \frac{1}{3} c$.
Let $v = v_{1,2}$, the velocity of the frame $R_1$ relative to $R_2$.

Consider the transformation from $R_1$ to $R_2$. The relative velocity between them is given by the motion of Spaceship-1 relative to $R_2$.

Let the velocity of $R_1$ with respect to $R_2$ be $V_{R_1/R_2}$.
If Spaceship-1 is at rest in $R_1$, then $v_{1/R_2} = V_{R_1/R_2}$. However, Spaceship-1 is moving relative to $R_2$.

Consider the sequence of transformations:
Velocity of Spaceship-0 in $R_1$.
Velocity of $R_1$ in $R_2$.

Let $v_{0/2}$ be the velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_2$.
We need the velocity of $R_1$ with respect to $R_2$.

The phrasing "Spaceship-0 is relativistically moving at the velocity $\frac{1}{3} c$ with respect to reference frame $R_{1}$, as measured by Spaceship-1" suggests that Spaceship-1 is in the reference frame where this measurement is made. This is a bit ambiguous.

Let's assume the standard interpretation of relative velocity between object and frame.

Step 1: Velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_2$.
We need the velocity of $R_1$ with respect to $R_2$. The motion of Spaceship-1 connects these frames.

Assume the frames are aligned such that the relative motion is along the x-axis.

Let the velocity of an object in frame S' be $u'$, and the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S be $v$. The velocity of the object in frame S is $u$:
$$u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u'v}{c^2}}$$

Consider the transformation from $R_1$ to $R_2$. The relative velocity is between them.
The velocity of Spaceship-1 with respect to $R_2$ is given.

Let the velocity of the origin of $R_1$ with respect to $R_2$ be $v_{R_1/R_2}$.

If we consider the motion of Spaceship-0, first relative to $R_1$, then relate $R_1$ to $R_2$.

The velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_1$ is $v_{0,1} = \frac{1}{3} c$.
The velocity of Spaceship-1 with respect to $R_2$ is $v_{1,2} = \frac{1}{2} c$.

Consider the velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to a frame where Spaceship-1 is at rest.

Let's use the concept of velocity transformations.
Velocity of Spaceship-0 in $R_1$: $\vec{v}_{0, R_1}$
Velocity of origin of $R_1$ in $R_2$: $\vec{v}_{R_1, R_2}$
Velocity of Spaceship-0 in $R_2$: $\vec{v}_{0, R_2} = \frac{\vec{v}_{0, R_1} + \vec{v}_{R_1, R_2}}{1 + \frac{\vec{v}_{0, R_1} \cdot \vec{v}_{R_1, R_2}}{c^2}}$

We need to determine $\vec{v}_{R_1, R_2}$.

The velocity of Spaceship-1 with respect to $R_2$ is given. If Spaceship-1 is momentarily at the origin of $R_1$, then $\vec{v}_{R_1, R_2} = \vec{v}_{1, 2}$.

Let's consider the sequence of relative velocities.
$v_{0/R_1} = \frac{1}{3} c$
$v_{1/R_2} = \frac{1}{2} c$
$v_{k/R_{k+1}} = \frac{k+1}{k+3} c$

Velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_2$:
Frame of reference 1: $R_1$
Frame of reference 2: $R_2$
Object: Spaceship-0

Velocity of object in frame 1 ($v_{0/R_1}$): $\frac{1}{3} c$.
Velocity of frame 1 with respect to frame 2 ($v_{R_1/R_2}$).

Consider the inverse transformation: velocity of Spaceship-0 in $R_1$ in terms of velocity in $R_2$.
Let $v_{0/R_2}$ be the velocity of Spaceship-0 in $R_2$.
Let $v_{R_2/R_1}$ be the velocity of $R_2$ with respect to $R_1$. This is the negative of the velocity of $R_1$ with respect to $R_2$.

The problem can be viewed as a chain of velocity additions.

Velocity of Spaceship-0 relative to $R_1$: $v_{0,1} = \frac{1}{3} c$.
Velocity of Spaceship-1 relative to $R_2$: $v_{1,2} = \frac{1}{2} c$.

Consider the relative velocity of $R_1$ and $R_2$. If Spaceship-1 is at rest in $R_1$, then the velocity of the origin of $R_1$ relative to $R_2$ is related to the motion of Spaceship-1.

Let the velocity of $R_1$ with respect to $R_2$ be $v_{R_1/R_2}$.
The velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_2$ is obtained by adding $v_{0/R_1}$ and $v_{R_1/R_2}$ relativistically.

We need to determine the relative velocity between consecutive reference frames.
The motion of Spaceship-k relates $R_k$ and $R_{k+1}$.

Consider the transformation between $R_1$ and $R_2$.
Spaceship-1 moves at $\frac{1}{2} c$ relative to $R_2$.
Assume Spaceship-1 is momentarily at the origin of $R_1$. The velocity of this origin relative to $R_2$ is the velocity of Spaceship-1 relative to $R_2$.
So, $v_{R_1/R_2} = v_{1,2} = \frac{1}{2} c$.

Now, add the velocities of Spaceship-0 relative to $R_1$ and $R_1$ relative to $R_2$:
$v_{0/R_2} = \frac{v_{0/R_1} + v_{R_1/R_2}}{1 + \frac{v_{0/R_1} v_{R_1/R_2}}{c^2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{3} c + \frac{1}{2} c}{1 + \frac{(\frac{1}{3} c)(\frac{1}{2} c)}{c^2}} = \frac{\frac{5}{6} c}{1 + \frac{1}{6}} = \frac{\frac{5}{6} c}{\frac{7}{6}} = \frac{5}{7} c$.

So, the speed of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_2$ is $\frac{5}{7} c$.

Now, consider the velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_3$.
We need the velocity of $R_2$ with respect to $R_3$. This is related to the motion of Spaceship-2.

Velocity of Spaceship-1 with respect to $R_2$: $v_{1,2} = \frac{1+1}{1+3} c = \frac{2}{4} c = \frac{1}{2} c$.
Velocity of Spaceship-2 with respect to $R_3$: $v_{2,3} = \frac{2+1}{2+3} c = \frac{3}{5} c$.

The velocity of the origin of $R_2$ relative to $R_3$ is $v_{R_2/R_3} = v_{2,3} = \frac{3}{5} c$.

Now, add the velocities of Spaceship-0 relative to $R_2$ and $R_2$ relative to $R_3$:
$v_{0/R_3} = \frac{v_{0/R_2} + v_{R_2/R_3}}{1 + \frac{v_{0/R_2} v_{R_2/R_3}}{c^2}} = \frac{\frac{5}{7} c + \frac{3}{5} c}{1 + \frac{(\frac{5}{7} c)(\frac{3}{5} c)}{c^2}} = \frac{(\frac{25+21}{35}) c}{1 + \frac{15}{35}} = \frac{\frac{46}{35} c}{\frac{50}{35}} = \frac{46}{50} c = \frac{23}{25} c$.

Let the velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_k$ be $u_k$.
$u_1 = v_{0/R_1} = \frac{1}{3} c$.
$u_2 = v_{0/R_2} = \frac{5}{7} c$.
$u_3 = v_{0/R_3} = \frac{23}{25} c$.

The velocity of the origin of $R_k$ relative to $R_{k+1}$ is $v_{R_k/R_{k+1}} = v_{k, k+1} = \frac{k+1}{k+3} c$.

The velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_{k+1}$ is given by adding the velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_k$ and the velocity of $R_k$ with respect to $R_{k+1}$.

$u_{k+1} = \frac{u_k + v_{R_k/R_{k+1}}}{1 + \frac{u_k v_{R_k/R_{k+1}}}{c^2}} = \frac{u_k + \frac{k+1}{k+3} c}{1 + u_k \frac{k+1}{k+3} \frac{1}{c}}$

Let's check the pattern for $u_k$.
$u_1 = \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3^2 - 8}{3^2 - 0} = \frac{1}{3}$

Consider the terms in the sequence:
$v_{0,1} = \frac{1}{3} c$
$v_{1,2} = \frac{2}{4} c$
$v_{2,3} = \frac{3}{5} c$
$v_{k, k+1} = \frac{k+1}{k+3} c$

Consider the transformation from $R_k$ to $R_{k+1}$.
Velocity of Spaceship-0 in $R_k$: $u_k$.
Velocity of origin of $R_k$ in $R_{k+1}$: $v_{k, k+1} = \frac{k+1}{k+3} c$.
Velocity of Spaceship-0 in $R_{k+1}$: $u_{k+1}$.

$u_{k+1} = \frac{u_k + \frac{k+1}{k+3} c}{1 + u_k \frac{k+1}{k+3} \frac{1}{c}}$

Let $u_k = \beta_k c$.
$\beta_{k+1} c = \frac{\beta_k c + \frac{k+1}{k+3} c}{1 + \beta_k c \frac{k+1}{k+3} \frac{1}{c}} = \frac{\beta_k + \frac{k+1}{k+3}}{1 + \beta_k \frac{k+1}{k+3}}$
$\beta_{k+1} = \frac{\beta_k (k+3) + (k+1)}{(k+3) + \beta_k (k+1)}$

$\beta_1 = \frac{1}{3}$.
$\beta_2 = \frac{\beta_1 (1+3) + (1+1)}{(1+3) + \beta_1 (1+1)} = \frac{\frac{1}{3} \cdot 4 + 2}{4 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 2} = \frac{\frac{4}{3} + 2}{4 + \frac{2}{3}} = \frac{\frac{10}{3}}{\frac{14}{3}} = \frac{10}{14} = \frac{5}{7}$.
Matches the previous calculation.

$\beta_3 = \frac{\beta_2 (2+3) + (2+1)}{(2+3) + \beta_2 (2+1)} = \frac{\frac{5}{7} \cdot 5 + 3}{5 + \frac{5}{7} \cdot 3} = \frac{\frac{25}{7} + 3}{5 + \frac{15}{7}} = \frac{\frac{25+21}{7}}{\frac{35+15}{7}} = \frac{46}{50} = \frac{23}{25}$.
Matches the previous calculation.

We need to find a pattern for $\beta_k$.
$\beta_1 = \frac{1}{3}$
$\beta_2 = \frac{5}{7}$
$\beta_3 = \frac{23}{25}$

Consider the numerators: 1, 5, 23.
Consider the denominators: 3, 7, 25.

Denominators seem to be $k^2 + 2$.
For $k=1$, $1^2+2 = 3$.
For $k=2$, $2^2+2 = 6$. No.

Let's look at the recursion:
$\beta_{k+1} = \frac{(k+3) \beta_k + (k+1)}{(k+1) \beta_k + (k+3)}$

Assume $\beta_k = \frac{N_k}{D_k}$.
$\frac{N_{k+1}}{D_{k+1}} = \frac{(k+3) N_k + (k+1) D_k}{(k+1) N_k + (k+3) D_k}$

If $N_k = k^2 - a$, $D_k = k^2 + b$.
$\beta_1 = \frac{1-a}{1+b} = \frac{1}{3} \implies 3 - 3a = 1 + b \implies 2 = 3a + b$.
$\beta_2 = \frac{4-a}{4+b} = \frac{5}{7} \implies 28 - 7a = 20 + 5b \implies 8 = 7a + 5b$.

Solve the system:
$6 = 9a + 3b$
$8 = 7a + 5b$
Multiply first by 5, second by 3:
$30 = 45a + 15b$
$24 = 21a + 15b$
Subtract: $6 = 24a \implies a = \frac{6}{24} = \frac{1}{4}$.
$2 = 3(\frac{1}{4}) + b \implies 2 = \frac{3}{4} + b \implies b = 2 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{5}{4}$.

So, $\beta_k = \frac{k^2 - 1/4}{k^2 + 5/4} = \frac{4k^2 - 1}{4k^2 + 5}$.
Check:
$\beta_1 = \frac{4-1}{4+5} = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}$.
$\beta_2 = \frac{16-1}{16+5} = \frac{15}{21} = \frac{5}{7}$.
$\beta_3 = \frac{36-1}{36+5} = \frac{35}{41}$. Does not match.

Let's try another form.
Consider $1 - \beta_k$.
$1 - \beta_1 = 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}$.
$1 - \beta_2 = 1 - \frac{5}{7} = \frac{2}{7}$.
$1 - \beta_3 = 1 - \frac{23}{25} = \frac{2}{25}$.

It seems $1 - \beta_k = \frac{2}{k^2 + 2}$.
Check:
$1 - \beta_1 = \frac{2}{1+2} = \frac{2}{3}$.
$1 - \beta_2 = \frac{2}{4+2} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$. No.

Consider $1 - \beta_k^2$.
$1 - (\frac{1}{3})^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{9} = \frac{8}{9}$.
$1 - (\frac{5}{7})^2 = 1 - \frac{25}{49} = \frac{24}{49}$.
$1 - (\frac{23}{25})^2 = 1 - \frac{529}{625} = \frac{96}{625}$.

We need $\beta_{20}$.
The velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_{20}$ is $u_{20} = \beta_{20} c$.

The recursion relates $\beta_{k+1}$ to $\beta_k$.

Consider the expression $1 - \beta_k$.
$1 - \beta_{k+1} = 1 - \frac{(k+3) \beta_k + (k+1)}{(k+1) \beta_k + (k+3)} = \frac{(k+1) \beta_k + (k+3) - (k+3) \beta_k - (k+1)}{(k+1) \beta_k + (k+3)}$
$= \frac{\beta_k (k+1 - k - 3) + k + 3 - k - 1}{(k+1) \beta_k + (k+3)} = \frac{-2 \beta_k + 2}{(k+1) \beta_k + (k+3)}$

If $\beta_k = \frac{k^2 + c_1}{k^2 + c_2}$.

Let's consider the form given in the problem: $0.\underbrace{99 \ldots 9}_{x \text { times }} c$.
This is $(1 - 10^{-x}) c$.
So, $\beta_{20} = 1 - 10^{-x}$.

We need to find $\beta_{20}$.

The recursion formula is the key.
The velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_{k+1}$ is obtained by adding the velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_k$ and the velocity of $R_k$ with respect to $R_{k+1}$.

The velocity of $R_k$ with respect to $R_{k+1}$ is $v_{k, k+1} = \frac{k+1}{k+3} c$.

Final velocity after $n$ steps:
Let $w_n$ be the velocity after $n$ additions.
$w_1 = v_1$
$w_2 = \frac{w_1 + v_2}{1 + w_1 v_2 / c^2}$
$w_3 = \frac{w_2 + v_3}{1 + w_2 v_3 / c^2}$

Here, $v_k = \frac{k}{k+2} c$.

The velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_{20}$ is obtained after 19 steps of velocity addition.
The first velocity is $v_{0/R_1} = \frac{1}{3} c$.
The relative velocities of the frames are:
$v_{R_1/R_2} = v_{1,2} = \frac{2}{4} c$
$v_{R_2/R_3} = v_{2,3} = \frac{3}{5} c$
...
$v_{R_{19}/R_{20}} = v_{19, 20} = \frac{20}{22} c$

The final velocity is obtained by successively adding these velocities.
The result of adding velocities $\beta_1 c, \beta_2 c, \ldots, \beta_n c$ is given by:
$\tanh^{-1}(\frac{v}{c}) = \tanh^{-1}(\beta_1) + \tanh^{-1}(\beta_2) + \ldots + \tanh^{-1}(\beta_n)$.

Here, the velocities being added are the relative velocities between consecutive frames.

Consider the rapidity $\phi = \tanh^{-1}(\beta)$.
Rapidity of Spaceship-0 in $R_1$: $\phi_{0,1} = \tanh^{-1}(\frac{1}{3})$.
Rapidity of $R_1$ in $R_2$: $\phi_{R_1, R_2} = \tanh^{-1}(\frac{1}{2})$.

Rapidity of Spaceship-0 in $R_2$: $\phi_{0,2} = \phi_{0,1} + \phi_{R_1, R_2} = \tanh^{-1}(\frac{1}{3}) + \tanh^{-1}(\frac{1}{2})$.
$\tanh(\phi_{0,2}) = \frac{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2}}{1 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{5}{6}}{\frac{7}{6}} = \frac{5}{7}$.

Rapidity of $R_k$ in $R_{k+1}$: $\phi_{R_k, R_{k+1}} = \tanh^{-1}(\frac{k+1}{k+3})$.

Total rapidity of Spaceship-0 in $R_{20}$:
$\phi_{0,20} = \phi_{0,1} + \phi_{R_1, R_2} + \phi_{R_2, R_3} + \ldots + \phi_{R_{19}, R_{20}}$
$\phi_{0,20} = \tanh^{-1}(\frac{1}{3}) + \tanh^{-1}(\frac{2}{4}) + \tanh^{-1}(\frac{3}{5}) + \ldots + \tanh^{-1}(\frac{20}{22})$

Term $k$: $\tanh^{-1}(\frac{k}{k+2})$.
Let $\frac{k}{k+2} = \tanh(\theta_k) = \frac{e^{\theta_k} - e^{-\theta_k}}{e^{\theta_k} + e^{-\theta_k}}$.
$k (e^{\theta_k} + e^{-\theta_k}) = (k+2) (e^{\theta_k} - e^{-\theta_k})$
$k e^{\theta_k} + k e^{-\theta_k} = (k+2) e^{\theta_k} - (k+2) e^{-\theta_k}$
$e^{-\theta_k} (k + k + 2) = e^{\theta_k} (k+2 - k)$
$e^{-\theta_k} (2k + 2) = e^{\theta_k} (2)$
$e^{2 \theta_k} = k+1$.
$\theta_k = \frac{1}{2} \ln(k+1)$.

$\phi_{0,20} = \frac{1}{2} (\ln(2) + \ln(3) + \ln(4) + \ldots + \ln(21))$
$\phi_{0,20} = \frac{1}{2} \ln(21!) = \ln(\sqrt{21!})$.

Velocity $\beta_{0,20} = \tanh(\phi_{0,20}) = \tanh(\ln(\sqrt{21!}))$
$= \frac{e^{\ln(\sqrt{21!})} - e^{-\ln(\sqrt{21!})}}{e^{\ln(\sqrt{21!})} + e^{-\ln(\sqrt{21!})}} = \frac{\sqrt{21!} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{21!}}}{\sqrt{21!} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{21!}}} = \frac{21! - 1}{21! + 1}$.

$\beta_{0,20} = 1 - 10^{-x}$.
$\frac{21! - 1}{21! + 1} = 1 - 10^{-x}$
$21! - 1 = (21! + 1) (1 - 10^{-x})$
$21! - 1 = 21! - 21! \cdot 10^{-x} + 1 - 10^{-x}$
$-2 = - 21! \cdot 10^{-x} - 10^{-x}$
$2 = 10^{-x} (21! + 1)$
$10^x = \frac{21! + 1}{2}$.

This does not seem right.

Let's re-evaluate the relative velocities.
Velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_{20}$.

$k (e^{\theta_k} + e^{-\theta_k}) = (k+2) (e^{\theta_k} - e^{-\theta_k})$

<text>If $N_k = k^2 - a$, $D_k = k^2 + b$.
$\beta_1 = \frac{1-a}{1+b} = \frac{1}{3} \implies 3 - 3a = 1 + b \implies 2 = 3a + b$.
$\beta_2 = \frac{4-a}{4+b} = \frac{5}{7} \implies 28 - 7a = 20 + 5b \implies 8 = 7a + 5b$.

Solve the system:
$6 = 9a + 3b$
$8 = 7a + 5b$
Multiply first by 5, second by 3:
$30 = 45a + 15b$
$24 = 21a + 15b$
Subtract: $6 = 24a \implies a = \frac{6}{24} = \frac{1}{4}$.
$2 = 3(\frac{1}{4}) + b \implies 2 = \frac{3}{4} + b \implies b = 2 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{5}{4}$.</text>

<text>The problem statement seems to imply that the relative velocities are between the spaceships and the reference frames, and the spaceships are used to measure these velocities. Let's interpret the movement of reference frames based on the motion of the measuring spaceships.

Interpretation 1: Reference frame $R_k$ moves with Spaceship-k.
If $R_1$ moves with Spaceship-1, then $v_{0/R_2}$ involves the velocity of $R_1$ relative to $R_2$.

Interpretation 2: The velocities are relative velocities between consecutive reference frames.</text>

<end>5011</end>
<text>The recursion formula is the key.
The velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_{k+1}$ is obtained by adding the velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_k$ and the velocity of $R_k$ with respect to $R_{k+1}$.

The velocity of $R_k$ with respect to $R_{k+1}$ is $v_{k, k+1} = \frac{k+1}{k+3} c$.

Final velocity after $n$ steps:
Let $w_n$ be the velocity after $n$ additions.
$w_1 = v_1$
$w_2 = \frac{w_1 + v_2}{1 + w_1 v_2 / c^2}$
$w_3 = \frac{w_2 + v_3}{1 + w_2 v_3 / c^2}$

Here, $v_k = \frac{k}{k+2} c$.</text>
<explanation>After several attempts that didn't lead to a clear solution, the solver returns to the fundamental recursion formula and tries a different approach by defining a new sequence to track the accumulated velocity.</explanation>

<start>5012</start>
<end>5336</end>
<text>The velocity of Spaceship-0 with respect to $R_{20}$ is obtained after 19 steps of velocity addition.
The first velocity is $v_{0/R_1} = \frac{1}{3} c$.
The relative velocities of the frames are:
$v_{R_1/R_2} = v_{1,2} = \frac{2}{4} c$
$v_{R_2/R_3} = v_{2,3} = \frac{3}{5} c$
...
$v_{R_{19}/R_{20}} = v_{19, 20} = \frac{20}{22} c$

The final velocity is obtained by successively adding these velocities.
The result of adding velocities $\beta_1 c, \beta_2 c, \ldots, \beta_n c$ is given by:
$\tanh^{-1}(\frac{v}{c}) = \tanh^{-1}(\beta_1) + \tanh^{-1}(\beta_2) + \ldots + \tanh^{-1}(\beta_n)$.</text>

<start>2703</start>
<end>2937</end>
<text>Now, add the velocities of Spaceship-0 relative to $R_2$ and $R_2$ relative to $R_3$:
$v_{0/R_3} = \frac{v_{0/R_2} + v_{R_2/R_3}}{1 + \frac{v_{0/R_2} v_{R_2/R_3}}{c^2}} = \frac{\frac{5}{7} c + \frac{3}{5} c}{1 + \frac{(\frac{5}{7} c)(\frac{3}{5} c)}{c^2}} = \frac{(\frac{25+21}{35}) c}{1 + \frac{15}{35}} = \frac{\frac{46}{35} c}{\frac{50}{35}} = \frac{46}{50} c = \frac{23}{25} c$.</text>
