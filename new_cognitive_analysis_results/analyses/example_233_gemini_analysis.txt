Find $m+n$ .

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the probability that the slope of the line determined by a random point $P$ in the unit square and a fixed point $Q = \left(\frac58, \frac38 \right)$ is greater than or equal to $\frac12$.

Let the coordinates of the random point $P$ be $(x, y)$, where $0 < x < 1$ and $0 < y < 1$. The point $P$ is chosen uniformly at random from the interior of the unit square. The area of the sample space (the unit square) is $1 \times 1 = 1$.

The fixed point is $Q = \left(\frac58, \frac38 \right)$.

The slope of the line determined by $P(x, y)$ and $Q\left(\frac58, \frac38 \right)$ is given by:
Slope $= m = \frac{y - \frac38}{x - \frac58}$

We are interested in the probability that $m \ge \frac12$.
$\frac{y - \frac38}{x - \frac58} \ge \frac12$

We need to consider the regions in the unit square where this inequality holds.

Case 1: $x - \frac58 > 0$, which means $x > \frac58$.
In this case, we can multiply by $2 \left(x - \frac58 \right)$ without changing the inequality sign.
$2 \left(y - \frac38 \right) \ge 1 \left(x - \frac58 \right)$
$2y - \frac68 \ge x - \frac58$
$2y - \frac34 \ge x - \frac58$
$2y \ge x - \frac58 + \frac34$
$2y \ge x - \frac58 + \frac68$
$2y \ge x + \frac18$
$y \ge \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$

We are considering the region where $x > \frac58$. The line $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$ divides the plane. We are interested in the region above or on this line.

The intersection of this region with the unit square ($0 < x < 1, 0 < y < 1$) and the condition $x > \frac58$.

The line $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$ passes through the points:
If $x = \frac58$, $y = \frac12 \left(\frac58 \right) + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{5}{16} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{6}{16} = \frac38$.
So, the line passes through the point $Q \left(\frac58, \frac38 \right)$, which makes sense.

If $x = 1$, $y = \frac12 (1) + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{8}{16} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{9}{16}$.
The point $(1, \frac{9}{16})$ is on the line.

Consider the region $R_1$ in the unit square where $x > \frac58$ and $y \ge \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$.
The boundaries are $x = \frac58$, $x = 1$, $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$, $y = 1$.

The vertices of this region are:
Intersection of $x = \frac58$ and $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$: $\left(\frac58, \frac38 \right)$
Intersection of $x = 1$ and $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$: $\left(1, \frac{9}{16} \right)$
Intersection of $x = 1$ and $y = 1$: $(1, 1)$

We need to check if the line $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$ intersects the top boundary $y = 1$ within the range $\frac58 < x < 1$.
If $y = 1$, $1 = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$, $\frac{15}{16} = \frac12 x$, $x = \frac{15}{8}$. This is greater than 1.

The region $R_1$ is a polygon with vertices $\left(\frac58, \frac38 \right), \left(1, \frac{9}{16} \right), (1, 1)$.
This is a triangle with vertices $\left(\frac58, \frac38 \right), \left(1, \frac{9}{16} \right), (1, 1)$.

The area of this triangle can be calculated using the determinant formula or by finding the area of the enclosing rectangle and subtracting the surrounding triangles.

Using the coordinates:
Area $= \frac12 \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|$
Area $= \frac12 \left| \frac58 \left(\frac{9}{16} - 1 \right) + 1 \left(1 - \frac38 \right) + 1 \left(\frac38 - \frac{9}{16} \right) \right|$
Area $= \frac12 \left| \frac58 \left(-\frac{7}{16} \right) + 1 \left(\frac{5}{8} \right) + 1 \left(\frac{6}{16} - \frac{9}{16} \right) \right|$
Area = $\frac12 \left| -\frac{35}{128} + \frac{5}{8} - \frac{3}{16} \right|$
Area = $\frac12 \left| -\frac{35}{128} + \frac{80}{128} - \frac{24}{128} \right|$
Area = $\frac12 \left| \frac{-35 + 80 - 24}{128} \right| = \frac12 \left| \frac{45 - 24}{128} \right| = \frac12 \left| \frac{21}{128} \right| = \frac{21}{256}$

Alternatively, we can integrate over the region.
The region is bounded by $x = \frac58$ to $1$, and $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$ to $1$.
Integral $= \int_{\frac58}^1 \left( 1 - \left(\frac12 x + \frac{1}{16} \right) \right) dx$
$= \int_{\frac58}^1 \left( 1 - \frac12 x - \frac{1}{16} \right) dx = \int_{\frac58}^1 \left( \frac{15}{16} - \frac12 x \right) dx$
$= \left[ \frac{15}{16} x - \frac14 x^2 \right]_{\frac58}^1$
$= \left( \frac{15}{16} (1) - \frac14 (1)^2 \right) - \left( \frac{15}{16} \left(\frac58 \right) - \frac14 \left(\frac58 \right)^2 \right)$
$= \left( \frac{15}{16} - \frac{4}{16} \right) - \left( \frac{75}{128} - \frac14 \cdot \frac{25}{64} \right)$
$= \frac{11}{16} - \left( \frac{75}{128} - \frac{25}{256} \right)$
$= \frac{11}{16} - \left( \frac{150}{256} - \frac{25}{256} \right) = \frac{11}{16} - \frac{125}{256}$
$= \frac{176}{256} - \frac{125}{256} = \frac{51}{256}$

Something is wrong. Let's recheck the vertices.
The region is a trapezoid with vertices $\left(\frac58, \frac38 \right), \left(1, \frac{9}{16} \right), (1, 1), \left(\frac58, 1 \right)$.
Vertices: $A = \left(\frac58, \frac38 \right)$, $B = \left(1, \frac{9}{16} \right)$, $C = (1, 1)$, $D = \left(\frac58, 1 \right)$.

Area of trapezoid = $\frac12 \times (\text{sum of parallel sides}) \times (\text{distance between parallel sides})$
Parallel sides are along $x = \frac58$ and $x = 1$. Distance $= 1 - \frac58 = \frac38$.
Lengths of parallel sides: $1 - \frac38 = \frac58$ (along $x = \frac58$) and $1 - \frac{9}{16} = \frac{7}{16}$ (along $x = 1$).
Area $= \frac12 \times \left( \frac58 + \frac{7}{16} \right) \times \frac38 = \frac12 \times \left( \frac{10}{16} + \frac{7}{16} \right) \times \frac38 = \frac12 \times \frac{17}{16} \times \frac38 = \frac{51}{256}$.

Case 2: $x - \frac58 < 0$, which means $x < \frac58$.
In this case, multiplying by $2 \left(x - \frac58 \right)$ reverses the inequality sign.
$2 \left(y - \frac38 \right) \le 1 \left(x - \frac58 \right)$
$2y - \frac34 \le x - \frac58$
$2y \le x - \frac58 + \frac34 = x + \frac18$
$y \le \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$

We are considering the region where $x < \frac58$. The line $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$ divides the plane. We are interested in the region below or on this line.

The intersection of this region with the unit square ($0 < x < 1, 0 < y < 1$) and the condition $x < \frac58$.

The boundaries are $x = 0$, $x = \frac58$, $y = 0$, $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$.

The vertices of this region are:
$(0, 0)$
Intersection of $x = \frac58$ and $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$: $\left(\frac58, \frac38 \right)$
Intersection of $x = 0$ and $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$: $\left(0, \frac{1}{16} \right)$

The region is a trapezoid with vertices $(0, 0), \left(\frac58, 0 \right), \left(\frac58, \frac38 \right), \left(0, \frac{1}{16} \right)$.
Parallel sides are along $y$-axis, distance $= \frac58 - 0 = \frac58$.
Lengths of parallel sides: $\frac{1}{16}$ (along $x = 0$) and $\frac38$ (along $x = \frac58$).
Area $= \frac12 \times \left( \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{8} \right) \times \frac58 = \frac12 \times \left( \frac{1}{16} + \frac{6}{16} \right) \times \frac58 = \frac12 \times \frac{7}{16} \times \frac58 = \frac{35}{256}$.

The probability is the area of the region where the slope condition is satisfied.
The condition is satisfied when:
1. $x > \frac58$ and $y \ge \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$
2. $x < \frac58$ and $y \le \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$

Region 1: Trapezoid with vertices $\left(\frac58, \frac38 \right), \left(1, \frac{9}{16} \right), (1, 1), \left(\frac58, 1 \right)$. Area $= \frac{51}{256}$.
Region 2: Trapezoid with vertices $(0, 0), \left(\frac58, 0 \right), \left(\frac58, \frac38 \right), \left(0, \frac{1}{16} \right)$. Area $= \frac{35}{256}$.

Total probability = Area of Region 1 + Area of Region 2
$= \frac{51}{256} + \frac{35}{256} = \frac{86}{256} = \frac{43}{128}$.

The probability is $\frac{43}{128}$.
This can be written as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m = 43$ and $n = 128$.
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
Prime factors of 43: 43 (prime number)
Prime factors of 128: $2^7 = 128$
So, 43 and 128 are relatively prime.

We need to find $m+n = 43 + 128 = 171$.

Double-checking the calculations.

Consider the line passing through $Q\left(\frac58, \frac38 \right)$ with slope $\frac12$.
Equation: $y - \frac38 = \frac12 \left(x - \frac58 \right)$
$y = \frac12 x - \frac{5}{16} + \frac{6}{16} = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$.

The inequality is $\frac{y - \frac38}{x - \frac58} \ge \frac12$.

Consider the point $Q = \left(\frac58, \frac38 \right)$ inside the unit square.
The line $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$ passes through $Q$.

The region where the slope is $\ge \frac12$.
If $x > \frac58$, we need $y \ge \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$. This is the region above the line to the right of $x = \frac58$.
If $x < \frac58$, we need $y \le \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$. This is the region below the line to the left of $x = \frac58$.

We need to find the area of the regions within the unit square where these conditions hold.

Region 1: $x > \frac58$, $0 < y < 1$, $y \ge \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$.
Vertices of the region: $\left(\frac58, \frac38 \right), \left(1, \frac{9}{16} \right), (1, 1), \left(\frac58, 1 \right)$.

Region 2: $x < \frac58$, $0 < y < 1$, $y \le \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$.
Vertices of the region: $(0, 0), \left(\frac58, 0 \right), \left(\frac58, \frac38 \right), \left(0, \frac{1}{16} \right)$.

The probability is the sum of the areas of these two regions.
Area of Region 1 = $\frac{51}{256}$.
Area of Region 2 = $\frac{35}{256}$.

Total probability = $\frac{51}{256} + \frac{35}{256} = \frac{86}{256} = \frac{43}{128}$.

So, $m = 43$, $n = 128$.
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
$m+n = 43 + 128 = 171$.

Alternative approach: Geometric probability.
The probability is the area of the favorable region divided by the total area (which is 1).

The favorable region is the union of the two trapezoids described above. These trapezoids share a common edge along the line segment from $(5/8, 1/16 + 5/16 = 6/16 = 3/8)$ to $(5/8, 1)$.

Let's visualize the unit square and the line $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$.
The line passes through $\left(\frac58, \frac38 \right)$.
When $x = 0$, $y = \frac{1}{16}$. Point $\left(0, \frac{1}{16} \right)$.
When $x = 1$, $y = \frac{9}{16}$. Point $\left(1, \frac{9}{16} \right)$.

The line divides the unit square.
We need the region where the slope is $\ge \frac12$.

Consider a point $P(x, y)$ in the unit square.
The slope of the line $PQ$ is $\frac{y - \frac38}{x - \frac58}$.

If $P$ is to the right of $Q$ ($x > \frac58$), the line $PQ$ has slope $\ge \frac12$ if $P$ is above the line $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$.
If $P$ is to the left of $Q$ ($x < \frac58$), the line $PQ$ has slope $\ge \frac12$ if $P$ is below the line $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$.

The favorable region consists of two parts:
Part 1: Right of $x = \frac58$ and above the line.
Part 2: Left of $x = \frac58$ and below the line.

The line $y = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$ divides the unit square.

Intersection points with the boundaries of the unit square:
With $x = 0$: $\left(0, \frac{1}{16} \right)$
With $x = 1$: $\left(1, \frac{9}{16} \right)$
With $y = 0$: $0 = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16} \implies x = -\frac{1}{8}$ (outside the square)
With $y = 1$: $1 = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16} \implies x = \frac{15}{8}$ (outside the square)

The line segment within the unit square connects $\left(0, \frac{1}{16} \right)$ and $\left(1, \frac{9}{16} \right)$.

The favorable region is the union of two polygons.
Polygon 1: Vertices $\left(\frac58, \frac38 \right), \left(1, \frac{9}{16} \right), (1, 1), \left(\frac58, 1 \right)$.
Polygon 2: Vertices $(0, 0), \left(\frac58, 0 \right), \left(\frac58, \frac38 \right), \left(0, \frac{1}{16} \right)$.

The areas were calculated correctly.
Area of Polygon 1 = $\frac{51}{256}$.
Area of Polygon 2 = $\frac{35}{256}$.

Total area of favorable region = $\frac{86}{256} = \frac{43}{128}$.
Probability = $\frac{43}{128}$.

$m = 43$, $n = 128$.
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
$m+n = 43 + 128 = 171$.

Region 1: Trapezoid with vertices $\left(\frac58, \frac38 \right), \left(1, \frac{9}{16} \right), (1, 1), \left(\frac58, 1 \right)$. Area $= \frac{51}{256}$.
Region 2: Trapezoid with vertices $(0, 0), \left(\frac58, 0 \right), \left(\frac58, \frac38 \right), \left(0, \frac{1}{16} \right)$. Area $= \frac{35}{256}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that in this geometric probability problem, the probability equals the ratio of the favorable area to the total area. They identify the regions that satisfy the slope condition and prepare to sum their areas.</explanation>

<text>Total probability = Area of Region 1 + Area of Region 2
$= \frac{51}{256} + \frac{35}{256} = \frac{86}{256} = \frac{43}{128}$.

The probability is $\frac{43}{128}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver completes the probability calculation by adding the areas of the two favorable regions and dividing by the total area (which is 1 for the unit square). This shows correct application of geometric probability principles.</explanation>

<text>This can be written as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m = 43$ and $n = 128$.
$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
Prime factors of 43: 43 (prime number)
Prime factors of 128: $2^7 = 128$
So, 43 and 128 are relatively prime.</text>
<explanation>The solver checks whether the fraction 43/128 is in its simplest form by examining the prime factorizations of the numerator and denominator. They correctly identify that 43 is prime and 128 is a power of 2, confirming the fraction cannot be simplified further.</explanation>

<text>Consider the line passing through $Q\left(\frac58, \frac38 \right)$ with slope $\frac12$.
Equation: $y - \frac38 = \frac12 \left(x - \frac58 \right)$
$y = \frac12 x - \frac{5}{16} + \frac{6}{16} = \frac12 x + \frac{1}{16}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver recalculates the equation of the line with slope 1/2 passing through the point Q, verifying their earlier derivation and ensuring the correctness of their approach.</explanation>
