Problem:
Find the least positive integer $n$ for which $2^n + 5^n - n$ is a multiple of $1000$ .

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to find the least positive integer n such that 2^n + 5^n - n is divisible by 1000. That means 2^n + 5^n - n ≡ 0 mod 1000. Since 1000 is 8×125, which are co-prime, I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. That means I should first find n such that 2^n + 5^n - n ≡ 0 mod 8 and 2^n + 5^n - n ≡ 0 mod 125, then combine the solutions.

Let me start with modulus 8. Let's compute the residues.

For modulus 8, 2^n mod 8 and 5^n mod 8. Let's note that 5 ≡ 5 mod 8, so 5^1=5, 5^2=25≡1 mod 8, and then the cycle repeats every 2 since 5^3 ≡5×1=5, 5^4≡1 etc. So 5^n mod8 cycles with period 2: 5 when n is odd, 1 when n is even.

Similarly, 2^n mod8: 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=0, and 2^n=0 mod8 for n ≥3. So for n ≥3, 2^n≡0 mod8.

Therefore, 2^n +5^n -n mod8 depends on n as follows:

Case1: n≥3. Then 2^n≡0, and 5^n≡5 if n odd, 1 if n even. Then, the expression is (0 + either5 or1) -n. Also, n mod8. Let me see:

So 2^n +5^n -n ≡ (0 +5) -n ≡5 -n mod8 if n is odd.

And 2^n +5^n -n ≡ (0 +1) -n ≡1 -n mod8 if n is even.

So we need that either, if n odd, 5 -n ≡0 mod8, or if n even, 1 -n ≡0 mod8.

Thus, requirement is:

If n odd: 5 ≡n mod8 →n≡5 mod8

If n even:1≡n mod8 →n≡1 mod8

But since for n odd, n≡5 mod8, and n is odd, so possible residues 5 mod8: numbers like5,13,21,...

Similarly, if n even, then n≡1 mod8, but 1 is odd. That's a contradiction, since if n is even, n must be ≡0,2,4,6 mod8. So n≡1 mod8 would imply n odd, which is inconsistent. Similarly, if n is even, 1 -n≡0 mod8 ⇒n≡1 mod8 which would require n to be odd. So in reality, for even n, we need 1 -n ≡0 mod8 ⇒ n≡1 mod8. But since n is even, which can’t be congruent to 1 mod8. Therefore, there's no solution with n even. Wait, that’s a problem. So either maybe I need to check my reasoning.

Wait, modulus 8. So let's check for n=1,2,3,4,5,...:

n=1: 2 +5 -1=6≡6 mod8 ≠0

n=2:4 +25 -2=27 ≡3 mod8 ≠0

n=3:8 +125 -3=130≡2 mod8 ≠0

n=4:16 +625 -4=637≡637-8×79=637-632=5 mod8 ≠0

n=5:32 +3125 -5=3152. 3152 div8=394, so ≡0 mod8. So 3152≡0 mod8. But wait, n=5 mod8 5 is odd, so n=5. Wait, according to my earlier analysis, if n≥3, for n odd, the expression is 5 -n mod8. So if n≡5 mod8, then 5 -5=0 mod8. So yes, n=5 would work. But 5 is congruent to5 mod8, and we see that n=5, expression is 3152 which is 0 mod8. So that works.

Wait, but then n=5,13,21,... in general, when n≡5 mod8. But since n must be at least3. So modulus8, the solutions would be n≡5 mod8.

Wait, when n=13, let's check. Let's compute2^13 +5^13 -13 mod8. Since 2^3≡0 mod8, higher exponents also ≡0. So 2^13≡0 mod8. 5^13≡5^(2*6 +1)= (5^2)^6 *5≡1^6 *5≡5 mod8. Therefore, 0 +5 -13 mod8. 5 -13= -8≡0 mod8. So yes, works. So even though n=13 is ≡5 mod8 (13-5=8, so 13≡5), that works.

Similarly, if n=21: 2^21≡0,5^21≡5 mod8. 5 -21= -16≡0 mod8. Correct.

Therefore, modulus8 requires that n ≡5 mod8.

Similarly, modulus125. So now I need to solve 2^n +5^n -n ≡0 mod125.

First, modulus125: 2^n and5^n modulo125. Note that 5^n when n>=3, since 5^3=125≡0 mod125. Therefore, for n>=3,5^n≡0 mod125, because 5^3=125 is divisible by125, and higher exponents will be multiples too. But wait, 5^1=5 mod125, 5^2=25 mod125, 5^3=0 mod125. So for n≥3,5^n≡0 mod125.

Similarly, 2^n mod125. The multiplicative order of2 modulo125. Since 125=53, φ(125)=100. So by Euler's theorem,2^100≡1 mod125. So the order divides100. Need to compute the order.

But maybe we can compute 2^φ(5^3)=2^100≡1 mod125. So 2^n cycles every 100 modulo125. So 2^n mod125 cycles with period dividing100. Therefore, 2^n cycles every 100.

But 2^n and5^n -n ≡0 mod125.

But 5^n depends on n.

For n≥3, 5^n≡0 mod125, hence 2^n +0 -n ≡0 mod125. Thus, 2^n -n≡0 mod125. But this applies only for n≥3. For n=1 or2, compute separately:

n=1:2 +5 -1=6≡6 mod125≠0.

n=2:4 +25 -2=27≡27 mod125≠0.

n=3:8 +0 -3=5≡5 mod125≠0.

n=4:16 +0 -4=12≡12 mod125≠0.

Similarly, n=5:32 +0 -5=27≡27 mod125≠0.

n=6:64 +0 -6=58≡58 mod125, etc. So definitely, for n≥3,5^n≡0, so expression reduces to 2^n -n≡0 mod125.

So for modulus125, problem reduces to solving 2^n ≡n mod125, for integers n≥3. I need to find the smallest such n≡5 mod8 (from the modulus8 condition) which satisfies 2^n ≡n mod125.

So now I need to find the smallest n≡5 mod8 where 2^n≡n mod125. That’s quite involved.

How to approach solving 2^n ≡n mod125 where n≡5 mod8. So we can set n=8k+5 for some k≥0. Substitute into 2^(8k+5) ≡8k+5 mod125. Therefore, 2^5*(2^8)^k ≡8k+5 mod125. Let me calculate 2^5=32 and 2^8=256. 256 mod125:125*2=250, so256-250=6. Therefore,2^8≡6 mod125. Then 2^(8k+5)=32 *6^k mod125. So equation becomes:

32*6^k ≡8k +5 mod125.

So rewrite:

32*6^k -8k -5 ≡0 mod125.

Simplify:

32*6^k ≡8k +5 mod125.

Thus, we need to find the smallest k >=0 such that32*6^k ≡8k +5 mod125.

This seems an equation in k. Since this is modulo125, which is 53, perhaps solving this requires some step-wise approach?

Possible methods: Solve congruence modulo5, lift to higher powers using Hensel's lemma? Let me start with mod5.

Let me check for k mod??. First, let's consider the equation mod5:

32*6^k ≡8k +5 mod5.

Since mod5:

32 ≡2 mod5,

6 ≡1 mod5,

8 ≡3 mod5,

5≡0 mod5.

So equation becomes 2*(1)^k ≡3k +0 mod5 ⇒2≡3k mod5.

Solving 3k ≡2 mod5 ⇒Multiply both sides by inverse of3 mod5, which is2, as3*2=6≡1 mod5. So k≡2*2≡4 mod5. So k≡4 mod5. So possible k=4 +5m.

So k ≡4 mod5. So possible solutions k=4,9,14,19,....

Now, next step: lift the solution mod5 to mod25.

So consider k=4 +5m. Let's define k=4 +5m, substitute into the original equation mod25.

Original equation:

32*6^k≡8k +5 mod125.

But we can proceed step by step, first to modulus25. Let's compute mod25 first.

First, compute mod25.

Compute 32*6^k mod25.

32 mod25=7.

6^k mod25. Let's note that 6^1=6, 6^2=36≡11,6^3=6*11=66≡16,6^4=6*16=96≡21,6^5=6*21=126≡1 mod25. So 6^5≡1 mod25, so period 5. Thus 6^(5m + r) ≡6^r mod25.

Given that k=4 +5m, let's write k=4+5m, then compute mod25:

Compute 32*6^(4 +5m) -8*(4 +5m) -5 ≡0 mod25.

But 6^(4 +5m)=6^4*(6^5)^m ≡21*(1)^m≡21 mod25.

Therefore, 32*21 ≡(6, mod25: 6*21=126≡1 mod25)? Wait no:

Wait 32≡7 mod25, and 21.

So 7*21=147≡147-5*25=147-125=22 mod25.

Then 32*6^k ≡22 mod25.

Right-hand side:8k +5.

k=4+5m. So 8*(4+5m)+5=32 +40m +5=37 +40m. So 37 +40m mod25: 37 mod25=12, 40m≡15m mod25. So total is 12 +15m mod25.

Therefore equation mod25 is:

22 ≡12 +15m mod25 ⇒15m ≡22 -12=10 mod25 ⇒15m≡10 mod25.

We can write 15m ≡10 mod25. Divide both sides by5: 3m ≡2 mod5 ⇒3m≡2 mod5 ⇒m≡4 mod5 (as inverse of3 mod5 is2, again). Thus m=4 +5n. Therefore, k=4 +5m=4 +5*(4 +5n)=4 +20 +25n=24 +25n. So k≡24 mod25.

Thus, general solution for k: k≡24 mod25. Hence k=24 +25n.

Now, proceed to lift to modulus125.

Original equation:

32*6^k ≡8k +5 mod125, where k=24 +25n. Let me substitute k=24 +25n and solve mod125.

First compute 6^k mod125. Since 6 and125 are coprime, Euler's theorem tells that 6^φ(125)=6^100≡1 mod125. Hence,6^k period divides100.

But let me compute 6^24 mod125 first, since k=24 +25n: 6^24*(6^25)^n. But 6^25=6^24 *6=(6^24)*6. So need to compute 6^24 first.

But calculating 6^24 mod125 directly is time-consuming. Let's use exponentiation by squaring.

Compute 6^1 mod125 =6.

6^2=36.

6^4=362=1296 mod125: 1296 -10*125=1296 -1250=46 mod125.

6^8=462=2116 mod125:2116 -16*125=2116 -2000=116 mod125.

6^16=1162=13456 mod125. 13456 divided by125: 125*107=13375, 13456 -13375=81 mod125.

Now,6^24=6^16 *6^8=81*116 mod125.

Compute 81*116:

Compute 80*116=9280, 1*116=116; total 9280 +116=9396. 9396 mod125:

125*75=9375. 9396 -9375=21 mod125. So 6^24≡21 mod125.

Then, 6^(24 +25n)=6^24 *(6^25)^n ≡21*(6^25 mod125)^n mod125.

Need to compute 6^25 mod125. First compute 6^1=6, 6^2=36, 6^4=46, 6^5=46*6=276 mod125=276 -2*125=26 mod125.

6^5≡26 mod125.

Then 6^25=(6^5)^5. So compute 26^5 mod125.

Compute 26^2=676 mod125. 676 -5*125=676 -625=51 mod125.

26^4=(26^2)^2=512=2601 mod125. 2601 -20*125=2601 -2500=101 mod125.

26^5=26^4 *26=101*26=2626 mod125. 2626 -21*125=2626 -2625=1 mod125. So 26^5≡1 mod125.

Hence,6^25≡1 mod125.

Therefore,6^(24 +25n)=6^24 *1^n≡21*1=21 mod125.

Therefore, 32 *6^k ≡32*21=672 mod125. Compute 672 divided by125: 125*5=625, so672-625=47 mod125. Thus, 32*6^k≡47 mod125.

On the RHS:8k +5=8*(24 +25n)+5=192 +200n +5=197 +200n. Compute mod125:197 -125=72, 200n=200n mod125= (200-125)n=75n mod125. So RHS≡72 +75n mod125.

Therefore, equation mod125:

47 ≡72 +75n mod125 ⇒75n ≡47 -72=-25 ≡100 mod125 ⇒So 75n ≡100 mod125.

Divide both sides by25: 3n≡4 mod5 ⇒3n≡4 mod5, so multiply both sides by inverse of3 mod5, which is 2: n≡2*4=8≡3 mod5. Thus, n≡3 mod5.

So n=3 +5m. Therefore, substituting back into k=24 +25n, k=24 +25*(3 +5m)=24 +75 +125m=99 +125m. So k≡99 mod125.

Therefore, k=99 +125m. Therefore, general solution is k=99 mod125.

But recall that this was based on n=8k+5.

Hence, n=8*(99 +125m) +5=792 +5 +1000m=797 +1000m.

Therefore, n≡797 mod1000. But is this the minimal solution? Wait, perhaps we need to check if this is correct. Wait, our initial approach was to lift solutions mod5 to mod25 to mod125. So through this step, when m=0, n=797.

But need to verify that n=797 satisfies 2^n +5^n -n≡0 mod125, then combine with modulus8 condition.

Wait, but previously, through the iterations, k=99 was obtained as a solution, leading to n=8*99 +5=792 +5=797. So, check if 797 satisfies 2^797 ≡797 mod125.

But since 5^n≡0 mod125 for n≥3, so it's required that 2^797≡797 mod125.

Compute 2^797 mod125. Maybe 2^100≡1 mod125, so 797 divided by100 is7*100=700, 797-700=97, so2^797=2^(7*100 +97)= (2^100)^7 *2^97≡1^7 *2^97≡2^97 mod125.

So compute 2^97 mod125. To compute this, note that 2^10=1024≡24 mod125, 2^20=(2^10)^2=242=576≡76 mod125, 2^40=(2^20)^2=762=5776 mod125. 5776 divided by125:125*46=5750, so5776-5750=26 mod125. So 2^40≡26 mod125. Then 2^80=(2^40)^2=262=676≡51 mod125. Now, 2^97=2^80 *2^17. We have 2^17. Compute 2^10=24 mod125. Thus2^17=2^10 *2^7=24*128 mod125. 24*128=3072. 3072 mod125:125*24=3000, so3072-3000=72 mod125. So 2^17≡72 mod125. Hence, 2^80=51, 2^17=72. So 2^97=51*72=3672 mod125. 3672 -29*125=3672 -3625=47 mod125. Hence, 2^97≡47 mod125. Therefore, 2^797≡47 mod125.

Now, check n=797 mod125:797 divided by125=6*125=750, so797-750=47. Thus, n=797≡47 mod125. Hence, 2^797≡47≡797 mod125. Yes, 47≡47 holds. So 2^797≡797 mod125. Hence, yes, correct.

Therefore, modulus125 requires n≡797 mod1000?

Wait, not necessarily. Wait, modulus8 gives n≡5 mod8, modulus125 requires n≡47 mod125 (since n=797≡47 mod125). The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us to solve for n:

n≡5 mod8

n≡47 mod125

Therefore, find n≡x mod1000.

So how to find the least n≥1 such that n≡5 mod8 and n≡47 mod125. The solution will be n≡47 mod125. Let me write n=125k +47. Then, substitute into the equation for modulus8:125k +47 ≡5 mod8. Compute 125 mod8=5, 47 mod8=7. Therefore:

5k +7 ≡5 mod8 ⇒5k≡ -2≡6 mod8 ⇒5k≡6 mod8. Multiplicative inverse of5 mod8 is5, as5*5=25≡1 mod8. Hence, k≡6*5=30≡6 mod8 ⇒k≡6 mod8.

Thus, k=8m +6. Hence, n=125*(8m +6)+47=1000m +750 +47=1000m +797. Therefore, the minimal solution is n=797, and the next one would be 1797 etc. Therefore, the minimal positive integer n satisfying both conditions is797.

But let's verify with n=797. We already checked mod125: 2^797≡47 mod125 and n=797≡47 mod125, so yes. For modulus8: n=797 mod8. 797/8=99*8 +5, so 797≡5 mod8. Therefore, according to modulus8, which required n≡5 mod8, this holds.

Hence, modulus1000 would be 797, so2^797 +5^797 -797≡0 mod1000. So is this indeed the case?

Wait, but before finalizing, let's check the original expression mod1000. But this computation is time-consuming, but since using the Chinese Remainder Theorem we satisfied mod8 and mod125 conditions, and since8 and125 are co-prime, then if a number satisfies both congruences, then it's ≡0 mod1000. So by construction, n=797 does satisfy 2^n +5^n -n ≡0 mod8 and0 mod125, hence0 mod1000.

Therefore, the minimal positive integer is797. However, to be thorough, maybe check n=797.

Wait, test if 2^797 +5^797 -797 is divisible by1000. Since directly computing is not feasible, but mod8:2^797≡0 mod8 (asn≥3),5^797≡5 mod8, so0 +5 -797≡5 -797 mod8. 797≡5 mod8, so5 -5=0 mod8. Hence, OK.

Mod125:5^797≡0 mod125 (as797≥3), so2^797≡797 mod125, so2^797 -797≡0 mod125. Hence,0 mod125.

Hence, all conditions satisfied. Thus,797 is indeed the minimal. Wait, but problem asks for the least such n. But need to check maybe smaller k? But when going through our solutions, since in modulus125 we had k=24 +25n leading to modulus125, when lifted, but finally comes down to797.

Is there a smaller n which satisfies both conditions? Let's think.

Our path said n≡5 mod8, solve 2^n≡n mod125. The solutions lift to n=797. But perhaps there is a smaller n congruent to5 mod8 which also satisfies2^n≡n mod125. So we can check n=5, which was done earlier.

But for n=5: 2^5=32. 32≡32 mod125. So does32≡5 mod125? 32≡5? No. So 32≡32≠5. Therefore, n=5 doesn't work.

Next, n=13 (5 +8): Check 2^13 mod125. 2^10=1024≡24, 2^13=24*8=192 mod125. 192 mod125=67. 67≡13 mod125? 67≠13. So no.

n=21: 2^21≡? Let's compute 2^20= (2^10)^2=242=576≡576-4*125=576-500=76 mod125. So2^21=76*2=152≡27 mod125. n=21. Does 27≡21 mod125? Nope. Doesn't work.

n=29: 2^29. Starting from2^25: as 2^20≡76 mod125. 2^25=2^20*2^5=76*32=2432 mod125. 2432-19*125=2432-2375=57 mod125. n=29. Does57≡29 mod125? 57-29=28≡? No.

n=37: For n=37, calculate 2^37. Since2^30= (2^10)^3=24^3=13824 mod125. 13824-110*125=13824-13750=74. 2^35=2^30*2^5=74*32 mod125. 74*32=2368 mod125. 2368-18*125=2368-2250=118. 2^37=118*4=472≡472-3*125=472-375=97 mod125. 97≡37 mod125? 97-37=60≡? No.

n=45:Compute2^45. Similarly tedious. Alternatively, cycle: Since2^20≡76,2^40≡762=5776≡26 mod125.2^40≡26,2^45=26*2^5=26*32=832 mod125.832-6*125=832-750=82 mod125. 82≡45 mod125? No.

n=53:2^53=2^40*2^13≡26*192≡26*192 mod125. 192 mod125=67, so26*67=1742≡1742-13*125=1742-1625=117 mod125. 117≡53 mod125? No.

n=61: Compute2^60= (2^20)^3=76^3=438976 divided by125: 438976=3511*125 +1, so≡1 mod125? Wait 76^3=76*76=5776≡26*76=1976≡1976-15*125=1976-1875=101 mod125.

Wait, 762=5776≡5776-46*125=5776-5750=26 mod125. 76^3=76*26=202, 202-1*125=77 mod125. 76^3=77 mod125.

So 2^60= (2^20)^3=77 mod125, then2^60=77,2^63=77*8=616≡616-4*125=616-500=116 mod125.

n=63: Not sure. Anyway, this way is tedious. Continuing n=797. Since based on modulus125 step-by-step led to k=99 leading to n=8k+5=797.

Given that the process followed steps of solving the congruency modulo5, lifting to 25, then to125, leading to k≡99 mod125, which then givesn=8*99 +5=797, which is the minimal solution as per the step-wise computation. Given that all the steps have to flow and confirm that there are no lower solutions, given that modulo5 led to k≡4 mod5, then to k=24 mod25, then k=99 mod125. So unless there was a lower solution, 797 is the minimal.

Alternatively, but why did modulus125 equation lead to solution mod125, but resulting in n≡797 mod1000? Let me just verify if n=797 is indeed the minimal. Since K=99; so starting from k>=0, the minimal k being99. Therefore, n=8*99 +5=797. Hence, it's indeed the minimal as other solutions would repeat every125 steps in k. Therefore, n=797 is the answer. So after thorough processing of CRT and lifting, the minimal solution is797.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{797}

<text>Okay, so I need to find the least positive integer n such that 2^n + 5^n - n is divisible by 1000. That means 2^n + 5^n - n ≡ 0 mod 1000. Since 1000 is 8×125, which are co-prime, I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem.</text>
<explanation>The solver immediately recognizes this as a modular arithmetic problem, correctly translating "is a multiple of 1000" into the congruence relation "≡ 0 mod 1000" and identifying that 1000 can be factored as 8×125 for applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem.</explanation>

<start>289</start>
<end>493</end>
<text>For modulus 8, 2^n mod 8 and 5^n mod 8. Let's note that 5 ≡ 5 mod 8, so 5^1=5, 5^2=25≡1 mod 8, and then the cycle repeats every 2 since 5^3 ≡5×1=5, 5^4≡1 etc. So 5^n mod8 cycles with period 2: 5 when n is odd, 1 when n is even.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates knowledge of modular arithmetic by analyzing the cyclic pattern of powers of 5 modulo 8, identifying the period of the cycle as 2.</explanation>

<start>2023</start>
<end>2190</end>
<text>First, modulus125: 2^n and5^n modulo125. Note that 5^n when n>=3, since 5^3=125≡0 mod125. Therefore, for n>=3,5^n≡0 mod125, because 5^3=125 is divisible by125, and higher exponents will be multiples too.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies modular arithmetic principles to determine that 5^n ≡ 0 (mod 125) for all n ≥ 3, which is a key insight for solving the problem.</explanation>

<skill>Number Theory Knowledge</skill>
<definition>Understanding and application of fundamental number theory concepts such as prime factorization, Euler's theorem, Fermat's little theorem, and the Chinese Remainder Theorem.</definition>

<start>149</start>
<end>254</end>
<text>Since 1000 is 8×125, which are co-prime, I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. That means I should first find n such that 2^n + 5^n - n ≡ 0 mod 8 and 2^n + 5^n - n ≡ 0 mod 125, then combine the solutions.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates knowledge of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, recognizing that since 8 and 125 are coprime, finding solutions modulo 8 and modulo 125 separately will allow them to find a solution modulo 1000.</explanation>

<start>2191</start>
<end>2296</end>
<text>Similarly, 2^n mod125. The multiplicative order of2 modulo125. Since 125=53, φ(125)=100. So by Euler's theorem,2^100≡1 mod125.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies Euler's theorem, correctly calculating φ(125) = 100 and deducing that 2^100 ≡ 1 (mod 125), showing deep knowledge of number theory principles.</explanation>

<start>6752</start>
<end>6953</end>
<text>Wait, but before finalizing, let's check the original expression mod1000. But this computation is time-consuming, but since using the Chinese Remainder Theorem we satisfied mod8 and mod125 conditions, and since8 and125 are co-prime, then if a number satisfies both congruences, then it's ≡0 mod1000.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates understanding of how the Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees that a solution that works modulo 8 and modulo 125 will work modulo 1000, since 8 and 125 are coprime.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Problem Decomposition</skill>
<definition>The ability to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, and then systematically solve each sub-problem to reach the final solution.</definition>

<start>149</start>
<end>254</end>
<text>Since 1000 is 8×125, which are co-prime, I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. That means I should first find n such that 2^n + 5^n - n ≡ 0 mod 8 and 2^n + 5^n - n ≡ 0 mod 125, then combine the solutions.</text>
<explanation>The solver strategically decomposes the original problem into two simpler sub-problems: finding n such that the expression is divisible by 8, and finding n such that the expression is divisible by 125.</explanation>

<start>2701</start>
<end>2857</end>
<text>So for modulus125, problem reduces to solving 2^n ≡n mod125, for integers n≥3. I need to find the smallest such n≡5 mod8 (from the modulus8 condition) which satisfies 2^n ≡n mod125.</text>
<explanation>The solver further simplifies the sub-problem modulo 125 by recognizing that for n ≥ 3, 5^n ≡ 0 (mod 125), which reduces the equation to 2^n ≡ n (mod 125).</explanation>

<start>2858</start>
<end>3087</end>
<text>So now I need to find the smallest n≡5 mod8 where 2^n≡n mod125. That's quite involved.

How to approach solving 2^n ≡n mod125 where n≡5 mod8. So we can set n=8k+5 for some k≥0. Substitute into 2^(8k+5) ≡8k+5 mod125. Therefore, 2^5*(2^8)^k ≡8k+5 mod125.</text>
<explanation>The solver further decomposes the problem by parameterizing n as 8k+5 (to satisfy the modulo 8 condition) and then focusing on finding the appropriate value of k that satisfies the modulo 125 condition.</explanation>

<text>But calculating 6^24 mod125 directly is time-consuming. Let's use exponentiation by squaring.

Compute 6^1 mod125 =6.

6^2=36.

6^4=362=1296 mod125: 1296 -10*125=1296 -1250=46 mod125.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that direct calculation of 6^24 would be inefficient and instead uses the exponentiation by squaring technique, calculating 6^1, 6^2, 6^4, etc., to efficiently compute 6^24 mod 125.</explanation>

<start>5799</start>
<end>6040</end>
<text>Compute 2^797 mod125. Maybe 2^100≡1 mod125, so 797 divided by100 is7*100=700, 797-700=97, so2^797=2^(7*100 +97)= (2^100)^7 *2^97≡1^7 *2^97≡2^97 mod125.

So compute 2^97 mod125. To compute this, note that 2^10=1024≡24 mod125, 2^20=(2^10)^2=242=576≡76 mod125</text>
<explanation>The solver uses modular properties and exponentiation by squaring to efficiently compute 2^797 mod 125, breaking it down into 2^100 (which is 1 mod 125) raised to the power of 7, multiplied by 2^97.</explanation>

<start>3275</start>
<end>3463</end>
<text>Let me calculate 2^5=32 and 2^8=256. 256 mod125:125*2=250, so256-250=6. Therefore,2^8≡6 mod125. Then 2^(8k+5)=32 *6^k mod125. So equation becomes:

32*6^k ≡8k +5 mod125.</text>
<explanation>The solver efficiently computes powers of 2 modulo 125 and uses these to transform the original equation into a more manageable form involving powers of 6 instead of powers of 2.</explanation>

<skill>Pattern Recognition</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify recurring patterns, cycles, and structures in mathematical sequences or operations, which can simplify complex calculations and lead to generalizable insights.</definition>

<start>289</start>
<end>493</end>
<text>For modulus 8, 2^n mod 8 and 5^n mod 8. Let's note that 5 ≡ 5 mod 8, so 5^1=5, 5^2=25≡1 mod 8, and then the cycle repeats every 2 since 5^3 ≡5×1=5, 5^4≡1 etc. So 5^n mod8 cycles with period 2: 5 when n is odd, 1 when n is even.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes the cyclic pattern in the sequence of powers of 5 modulo 8, identifying that it repeats with period 2.</explanation>

<start>494</start>
<end>609</end>
<text>Similarly, 2^n mod8: 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=0, and 2^n=0 mod8 for n ≥3. So for n ≥3, 2^n≡0 mod8.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies another pattern: that 2^n ≡ 0 (mod 8) for all n ≥ 3, which significantly simplifies the modulo 8 calculations.</explanation>

<start>4576</start>
<end>4716</end>
<text>Need to compute 6^25 mod125. First compute 6^1=6, 6^2=36, 6^4=46, 6^5=46*6=276 mod125=276 -2*125=26 mod125.

6^5≡26 mod125.

Then 6^25=(6^5)^5.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that 6^25 can be computed as (6^5)^5, identifying a pattern that allows for more efficient calculation.</explanation>

<skill>Systematic Verification</skill>
<definition>The practice of methodically checking and validating results at various stages of problem-solving to ensure correctness, catch errors, and confirm that the solution satisfies all required conditions.</definition>

<start>5733</start>
<end>5970</end>
<text>Wait, but previously, through the iterations, k=99 was obtained as a solution, leading to n=8*99 +5=792 +5=797. So, check if 797 satisfies 2^797 ≡797 mod125.

But since 5^n≡0 mod125 for n≥3, so it's required that 2^797≡797 mod125.</text>
<explanation>The solver systematically verifies that their candidate solution n=797 satisfies the required condition 2^797 ≡ 797 (mod 125).</explanation>

<start>6688</start>
<end>6953</end>
<text>Hence, modulus1000 would be 797, so2^797 +5^797 -797≡0 mod1000. So is this indeed the case?

Wait, but before finalizing, let's check the original expression mod1000. But this computation is time-consuming, but since using the Chinese Remainder Theorem we satisfied mod8 and mod125 conditions, and since8 and125 are co-prime, then if a number satisfies both congruences, then it's ≡0 mod1000.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies that their solution satisfies the original problem statement by checking that it works modulo both 8 and 125, and therefore must work modulo 1000 by the Chinese Remainder Theorem.</explanation>

<start>6954</start>
<end>7212</end>
<text>Therefore, the minimal positive integer is797. However, to be thorough, maybe check n=797.

Wait, test if 2^797 +5^797 -797 is divisible by1000. Since directly computing is not feasible, but mod8:2^797≡0 mod8 (asn≥3),5^797≡5 mod8, so0 +5 -797≡5 -797 mod8. 797≡5 mod8, so5 -5=0 mod8. Hence, OK.</text>
<explanation>The solver performs a final verification of their solution, checking that 2^797 + 5^797 - 797 is indeed divisible by 1000 by verifying the conditions modulo 8 and modulo 125.</explanation>

<end>3823</end>
<text>Possible methods: Solve congruence modulo5, lift to higher powers using Hensel's lemma? Let me start with mod5.

Let me check for k mod??. First, let's consider the equation mod5:

32*6^k ≡8k +5 mod5.</text>
<explanation>The solver employs an iterative refinement approach, starting by solving the congruence modulo 5 (a simpler case) with the intention of lifting the solution to higher powers of 5.</explanation>

<start>3824</start>
<end>3984</end>
<text>Since mod5:

32 ≡2 mod5,

6 ≡1 mod5,

8 ≡3 mod5,

5≡0 mod5.

So equation becomes 2*(1)^k ≡3k +0 mod5 ⇒2≡3k mod5.</text>
<explanation>The solver simplifies the equation modulo 5 by reducing each term to its residue modulo 5, which is a key step in the iterative refinement process.</explanation>

<start>4063</start>
<end>4233</end>
<text>So k ≡4 mod5. So possible solutions k=4,9,14,19,....

Now, next step: lift the solution mod5 to mod25.

So consider k=4 +5m. Let's define k=4 +5m, substitute into the original equation mod25.</text>
<explanation>After finding that k ≡ 4 (mod 5), the solver proceeds to lift this solution to modulo 25 by parameterizing k as 4+5m, demonstrating the iterative refinement process.</explanation>
