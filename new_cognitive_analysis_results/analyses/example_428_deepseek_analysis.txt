Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to solve for the value of 2x3 + (xy)3 + 2y3 given the equations x4y5 + y4x5 = 810 and x3y6 + y3x6 = 945. Hmm, that seems a bit complex. Let me start by trying to simplify or find relationships between these equations.

First, let me write down the given equations again for clarity:

1. x4y5 + y4x5 = 810
2. x3y6 + y3x6 = 945

And we need to find 2x3 + (xy)3 + 2y3. Hmm. Maybe we can factor something out or use substitution. Let's look for patterns or common factors in the equations.

Starting with the first equation: x4y5 + y4x5. I notice that both terms have x4y4 in common. Let's factor that out:

x4y4(y + x) = 810

So, x4y4(x + y) = 810. Okay, so that's equation (1) simplified.

Now looking at the second equation: x3y6 + y3x6. Similarly, let's see if we can factor something out. Here, both terms have x3y3 in common:

x3y3(y3 + x3) = 945

So, x3y3(x3 + y3) = 945. Okay, so equation (2) becomes x3y3(x3 + y3) = 945.

Hmm, now, the expression we need to find is 2x3 + (xy)3 + 2y3. Let's write that as 2(x3 + y3) + (xy)3. So if I can find x3 + y3 and xy, then I can plug those values into this expression.

So, the problem reduces to finding x3 + y3 and xy. Let's assign variables to these to make it easier. Let me let a = x + y and b = xy. Then, x3 + y3 can be expressed in terms of a and b as a3 - 3ab. So, x3 + y3 = (x + y)3 - 3xy(x + y) = a3 - 3ab.

Given that, we can look at the two equations:

From equation (1): x4y4(x + y) = x4y4a = (xy)^4 * a = b^4 * a = 810.

From equation (2): x3y3(x3 + y3) = (xy)^3 * (a3 - 3ab) = b3(a3 - 3ab) = 945.

So, now we have:

1. b4a = 810

2. b3(a3 - 3ab) = 945

Hmm, maybe we can divide these equations or find a ratio to eliminate variables. Let's try to do that.

Let me denote equation (1) as Eq1 and equation (2) as Eq2.

From Eq1: a = 810 / b4.

Plug this into Eq2:

b3[( (810 / b4 )3 - 3b*(810 / b4 )) ] = 945

Let me simplify the expression inside the brackets:

First term: (810 / b4 )3 = 8103 / b12

Second term: -3b*(810 / b4 ) = -3*810 / b3

So, substituting:

b3[8103 / b12 - 3*810 / b3 ] = 945

Multiply through by b3:

b3*(8103 / b12) - b3*(3*810 / b3) = 945

Simplify each term:

First term: 8103 / b9

Second term: -3*810 = -2430

So, Eq2 becomes:

8103 / b9 - 2430 = 945

Then, 8103 / b9 = 945 + 2430 = 3375

Therefore, 8103 / b9 = 3375

Then, solving for b9:

b9 = 8103 / 3375

Let me compute 8103 and 3375.

Firstly, note that 810 = 81 * 10 = 92 * 10

3375 is 153, which is 3375. Because 15*15=225, 225*15=3375. So 153=3375.

Also, 810=15*54, but perhaps another way. Let's see:

8103 = (810)^3, and 3375 = 15^3. So,

b^9 = (810 / 15)^3

Wait:

If we write 8103 / 153 = (810/15)^3. But 810 divided by 15 is 54, because 15*50=750, 15*4=60, 50+4=54. So 15*54=810.

So, 810/15=54, so (810/15)^3=543. Thus,

b^9 = 543

Then, take the ninth root of both sides:

But wait, b^9 = (54)^3. Therefore, b = (54)^(3/9) = 54^(1/3)

Simplify 54^(1/3). 54=27*2=33*2. So,

54^(1/3) = (33*2)^(1/3) = 3*(2)^(1/3)

Therefore, b = 3*2^(1/3). Hmm, okay.

Alternatively, perhaps?

Wait, 543^(1/9) is 54^(1/3) since 3/9=1/3. So, yes.

Hence, b = 54^(1/3). But 54 = 27*2, as I said, and 27=33, so 54^(1/3) is 3*2^(1/3).

Therefore, b = 3* cube root of 2.

So, xy = 3*2^(1/3)

Okay, and from equation (1): a = 810 / b^4.

So, substituting b = 3*2^(1/3), compute a.

First, compute b^4:

b^4 = (3)^4 * (2^(1/3))^4 = 81 * 2^(4/3)

Since (2^(1/3))^4 is 2^(4/3).

Thus, a = 810 / (81 * 2^(4/3)) ) = (810/81) / 2^(4/3) = 10 / 2^(4/3)

Simplify 10 divided by 2^(4/3):

2^(4/3) is 2^(1 + 1/3) = 2*2^(1/3). Therefore,

a = 10 / (2 * 2^(1/3)) ) = (10/2) / 2^(1/3) = 5 / 2^(1/3) = 5*2^(-1/3)

Alternatively, 5 / 2^(1/3).

So, a = x + y = 5 / 2^(1/3).

So now, let's recap:

We have:

xy = b = 3*2^(1/3)

x + y = a = 5 / 2^(1/3)

We need to find 2(x3 + y3 ) + (xy)3.

From earlier, x3 + y3 = a3 - 3ab.

So let's compute a3 - 3ab.

Compute a3:

a3 = (5 / 2^(1/3))3 = 125 / (2^(1)) = 125 / 2

Compute 3ab:

3ab = 3 * (5 / 2^(1/3)) * (3*2^(1/3)) = 3*5*3* (2^(1/3) / 2^(1/3)) ) = 45 *1=45

Hence, x3 + y3 = 125/2 -45= (125 - 90)/2=35/2=17.5

Thus, x3 + y3 = 35/2.

Then, let's compute (xy)^3 = (3*2^(1/3))^3= 27*(2^(1/3))^3=27*2=54.

Thus, the expression is 2*(35/2)+54=35 +54=89.

Wait, 2*(x3 + y3) + (xy)^3 = 2*(35/2) +54=35 +54=89. Hence, the answer is 89.

Wait, that's straightforward. Let me verify my steps again to ensure I didn't miscalculate.

Compute b: as per equation, b9 =543, so b=54^(1/3). Then, 54 is 27*2, so cube root is 3*2^(1/3), correct.

Then, a =810 / b^4= 810/(3*2^(1/3))^4 =810/(81*2^(4/3))=10 / 2^(4/3)=5/2^(1/3). Correct.

Then, compute x3 + y3. First, a3: (5/2^(1/3))3=125/(2^(1)))=125/2, which is 62.5.

Wait a minute, previously I had 125/2 -45. 125/2 is 62.5, subtract 45, so 62.5 - 45 =17.5, which is 35/2, yes.

But let me compute 3ab:

a=5 / 2^(1/3), b=3*2^(1/3)

Multiply them: a*b= (5 /2^(1/3)) *3*2^(1/3)= 15* (2^(1/3)/2^(1/3))=15.

Hence, 3ab=3*15=45. Correct.

So, x3 + y3 =62.5 -45=17.5=35/2. Then, (xy)^3=54. Then 2*(x3 + y3)=2*(35/2)=35. So total expression is 35 +54=89. That's right.

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check with substituting the values into equations.

Wait, let me verify if the computed a and b satisfy the original equations. So if we have a=5/2^(1/3), and b=3*2^(1/3). Let's compute equation (1): b4 *a.

b^4 = (3^4)*(2^(1/3))^4=81*2^(4/3). Then a=5/2^(1/3). Multiply: 81*2^(4/3)*5/2^(1/3)=81*5*2^(4/3 -1/3)=81*5*2^(1)=81*5*2=810. Correct. That's equation (1) okay.

Now check equation (2): b3(a3 -3ab).

b3 = (3^3)*(2^(1/3))^3=27*2^(1). So 27*2=54.

Then, a3 -3ab =125/2 -45=35/2. So equation (2) should be 54*(35/2)=54*35/2= (54/2)*35=27*35=945. Which is correct. So, indeed, our a and b satisfy both equations. Therefore, the computation steps are correct.

Thus, the expression 2x3 + (xy)3 + 2y3 equals 89.

Then, compute x3 + y3. First, a3: (5/2^(1/3))3=125/(2^(1)))=125/2, which is 62.5.

Wait a minute, previously I had 125/2 -45. 125/2 is 62.5, subtract 45, so 62.5 - 45 =17.5, which is 35/2, yes.

But let me compute 3ab:

a=5 / 2^(1/3), b=3*2^(1/3)

Multiply them: a*b= (5 /2^(1/3)) *3*2^(1/3)= 15* (2^(1/3)/2^(1/3))=15.

Hence, 3ab=3*15=45. Correct.</text>
<explanation>The solver systematically rechecks each calculation step, including the computation of b, a, and the expression x³+y³, demonstrating thorough verification.</explanation>

<start>4636</start>
<end>5120</end>
<text>Wait, let me verify if the computed a and b satisfy the original equations. So if we have a=5/2^(1/3), and b=3*2^(1/3). Let's compute equation (1): b4 *a.

b^4 = (3^4)*(2^(1/3))^4=81*2^(4/3). Then a=5/2^(1/3). Multiply: 81*2^(4/3)*5/2^(1/3)=81*5*2^(4/3 -1/3)=81*5*2^(1)=81*5*2=810. Correct. That's equation (1) okay.

Now check equation (2): b3(a3 -3ab).

b3 = (3^3)*(2^(1/3))^3=27*2^(1). So 27*2=54.

Then, a3 -3ab =125/2 -45=35/2. So equation (2) should be 54*(35/2)=54*35/2= (54/2)*35=27*35=945. Which is correct. So, indeed, our a and b satisfy both equations. Therefore, the computation steps are correct.</text>
