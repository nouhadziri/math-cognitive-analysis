Problem:
The set  $S$  contains nine numbers. The mean of the numbers in  $S$  is  $202.$  The mean of the five smallest of the numbers in  $S$  is  $100.$  The mean of the five largest numbers in  $S$  is  $300.$  What is the median of the numbers in  $S?$ 

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Define the variables and given conditions:**
   Let the 9 numbers in the set \( S \) be \( a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i \) such that \( a \leq b \leq c \leq d \leq e \leq f \leq g \leq h \leq i \).

2. **Calculate the total sum of the numbers in \( S \):**
   The mean of the numbers in \( S \) is 202. Therefore, the total sum of the numbers in \( S \) is:
   \[
   a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i = 9 \times 202 = 1818
   \]

3. **Calculate the sum of the five smallest numbers:**
   The mean of the five smallest numbers is 100. Therefore, the sum of the five smallest numbers is:
   \[
   a + b + c + d + e = 5 \times 100 = 500
   \]

4. **Calculate the sum of the five largest numbers:**
   The mean of the five largest numbers is 300. Therefore, the sum of the five largest numbers is:
   \[
   e + f + g + h + i = 5 \times 300 = 1500
   \]

5. **Combine the equations to find \( e \):**
   We have two equations:
   \[
   a + b + c + d + e = 500
   \]
   \[
   e + f + g + h + i = 1500
   \]
   Adding these two equations, we get:
   \[
   (a + b + c + d + e) + (e + f + g + h + i) = 500 + 1500
   \]
   \[
   a + b + c + d + 2e + f + g + h + i = 2000
   \]

6. **Use the total sum to solve for \( e \):**
   We know the total sum of all nine numbers is 1818. Therefore:
   \[
   a + b + c + d + 2e + f + g + h + i = 2000
   \]
   \[
   1818 + 2e = 2000
   \]
   \[
   2e = 2000 - 1818
   \]
   \[
   2e = 182
   \]
   \[
   e = \frac{182}{2} = 91
   \]

7. **Determine the median:**
   Since \( e \) is the fifth number in the ordered list and there are nine numbers, \( e \) is the median.

Conclusion:
\[
\boxed{91}
\]
