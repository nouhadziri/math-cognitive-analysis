Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let G be a finite group and H be a normal subgroup of G.
We want to determine if it is possible to have $|\text{Aut } H| > |\text{Aut } G|$.

Let's consider some simple cases.
Case 1: H = G. In this case, $|\text{Aut } H| = |\text{Aut } G|$, so the condition is not satisfied.
Case 2: H is the trivial subgroup. Then Aut(H) is the trivial group, so $|\text{Aut } H| = 1$. If G is non-trivial, $|\text{Aut } G| \ge 1$. For example, if G = Z_2, then |Aut G| = 1. In this case, |Aut H| is not greater than |Aut G|.

Consider the case when H is a cyclic group.
If H = Z_n, then Aut(H) is isomorphic to the group of units modulo n, (Z/nZ)^*. The order of Aut(H) is $\phi(n)$.
If G is abelian, then the inner automorphisms are trivial, so Aut(G) includes the outer automorphisms.

Let's consider a concrete example.
Let H = Z_2. Then |Aut H| = |Aut(Z_2)| = |(Z/2Z)^*| = |{1}| = 1.
Let G = Z_4. H = {0, 2} is a normal subgroup of G, and H is isomorphic to Z_2.
|Aut H| = 1.
|Aut G| = |Aut(Z_4)| = |(Z/4Z)^*| = |{1, 3}| = 2.
In this case, |Aut H| < |Aut G|.

Let H = Z_2. Let G = S_3. H is not a normal subgroup of G.
Let H = A_3 in G = S_3. H is a normal subgroup of G. H is isomorphic to Z_3.
|Aut H| = |Aut(Z_3)| = |(Z/3Z)^*| = |{1, 2}| = 2.
|Aut G| = |Aut(S_3)|. The automorphisms of S_n are the inner automorphisms for n != 6.
So |Aut(S_3)| = |S_3| = 6.
In this case, |Aut H| < |Aut G|.

Let H = Z_2 x Z_2. The order of Aut(H) is |GL(2, 2)| = (2^2 - 1)(2^2 - 2) = 3 * 2 = 6.
Let G = Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2. Let H = Z_2 x Z_2 be a subgroup of G. H is normal in G because G is abelian.
|Aut H| = 6.
|Aut G| = |Aut(Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2)| = |GL(3, 2)| = (2^3 - 1)(2^3 - 2)(2^3 - 2^2) = 7 * 6 * 4 = 168.
In this case, |Aut H| < |Aut G|.

Consider the case where H is a large subgroup of G.
If H is normal in G, there is a homomorphism from G to Aut(H) given by the conjugation action: $g \mapsto \phi_g$, where $\phi_g(h) = ghg^{-1}$.
The kernel of this homomorphism is $C_G(H) = \{g \in G \mid ghg^{-1} = h \text{ for all } h \in H \}$.
So $G/C_G(H)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of Aut(H).
This means $|G/C_G(H)| \le |\text{Aut } H|$.

Let H be a simple group with trivial center. Then Aut(H) is isomorphic to the symmetric group of cosets of a subgroup.
Consider a group G such that Aut(G) is small.
Consider a group H with a large automorphism group.

Let H be a non-abelian simple group. Then the inner automorphism group Inn(H) is isomorphic to H. And Inn(H) is a normal subgroup of Aut(H).
Consider H = S_3. Aut(S_3) is isomorphic to S_3.
Can we find a group G containing S_3 as a normal subgroup such that |Aut(S_3)| > |Aut(G)|? This would mean 6 > |Aut(G)|.
If G is a subgroup of Aut(S_3), for instance G = S_3, then |Aut(G)| = |Aut(S_3)|.
If G is a proper subgroup of S_3, say G = A_3 = Z_3. Then Aut(G) = Aut(Z_3) = Z_2. In this case |Aut H| > |Aut G|. But H is not a normal subgroup of G.

Let H be a finite group with trivial center. Then H can be embedded as a normal subgroup of Aut(H). Let G = Aut(H). Then |Aut H| is not greater than |Aut G|.

Let H = Z_n where n has many prime factors, so $\phi(n)$ is relatively large.
Let G be a relatively small group that contains Z_n as a normal subgroup.
Consider the case where G is the direct product of H with some other group K, such that Aut(K) is small.
Let H = Z_p for a large prime p. |Aut H| = p-1.
Let G = Z_p x Z_2. The automorphisms of G can swap the elements (a, 0) with (a, 1).
Aut(Z_p x Z_2) is a bit complicated.

Consider a specific example:
Let H = Z_3. |Aut H| = 2.
Let G be a group such that H is a normal subgroup of G.
Consider G = S_3. H = A_3 is normal in G. |Aut H| = 2, |Aut G| = 6.
Consider G = Z_3. H = Z_3 is normal in G. |Aut H| = 2, |Aut G| = 2.

Consider a group H such that Aut(H) is large, and a group G such that Aut(G) is small.
Let H be a non-abelian group. Let Inn(H) be the group of inner automorphisms. Inn(H) is a normal subgroup of Aut(H), and Inn(H) is isomorphic to H/Z(H).
If Z(H) is trivial, then Inn(H) is isomorphic to H.

Let H be a group with a large automorphism group. Consider G to be a relatively small extension of H.
Consider H = S_n for n >= 3, n != 6. |Aut H| = |S_n| = n!.
We need to find a group G containing S_n as a normal subgroup such that |Aut G| < n!.
Consider G to be a subgroup of Aut(S_n), such that S_n is a normal subgroup of G.
If G is a subgroup of Aut(H) containing Inn(H), then the automorphisms of G must respect the structure of H.

Let H be a finite abelian group. Then the map $\phi: H \to H$ given by $\phi(x) = x^{-1}$ is an automorphism. If $H$ has exponent $> 2$, this is a non-trivial automorphism.
Consider $H = Z_3 \times Z_3$. $|Aut(H)| = |GL(2, 3)| = (3^2 - 1)(3^2 - 3) = 8 \times 6 = 48$.
Let G be a group containing $Z_3 \times Z_3$ as a normal subgroup.
If $G = Z_3 \times Z_3$, then $|Aut G| = 48$.
If $G$ is a semi-direct product of $Z_3 \times Z_3$ with some group K.

Consider the case where H is the Klein four-group $V_4 = Z_2 \times Z_2$. $|Aut(V_4)| = |GL(2, 2)| = 6$.
Let G be a group containing $V_4$ as a normal subgroup.
Consider G = A_4. V_4 is a normal subgroup of A_4.
$|Aut(A_4)| = |S_4| = 24$. In this case $|Aut H| < |Aut G|$.

Consider the case when G is a p-group.
Let H be the center of G, Z(G). H is a normal subgroup of G.
If G is abelian, H = G, so |Aut H| = |Aut G|.
If G is not abelian, |Z(G)| < |G|.

Let H be a finite group. Consider G = Aut(H). Then H can be embedded in Aut(H) as Inn(H). Inn(H) is a normal subgroup of Aut(H).
|Aut(Inn(H))| = |Aut(H/Z(H))|.
We want |Aut H| > |Aut(Aut H)|.

Consider a small group for G. Let G = Z_3. The only normal subgroup is the trivial group and G itself.
If H = {e}, |Aut H| = 1, |Aut G| = 2.
If H = G, |Aut H| = 2, |Aut G| = 2.

Consider the case where Aut(H) is large and Aut(G) is small. This typically happens if H has a lot of symmetry and G has very little symmetry beyond that of H.

Let H be a finite group. Let G be a subgroup of Aut(H). If H is characteristic in G, then any automorphism of G restricts to an automorphism of H.

Let H be a simple group with trivial center. Then Inn(H) is isomorphic to H, and Inn(H) is normal in Aut(H).
Aut(Inn(H)) = Aut(H).
We want |Aut H| > |Aut(Aut H)|.
For S_n (n != 6), |Aut(S_n)| = |S_n|. We need |S_n| > |Aut(S_n)| = |S_n|, which is false.

Consider a different approach. We need to construct a specific example.
Let H be a group with a large number of automorphisms.
Let G be a group with a small number of automorphisms.
We need H to be a normal subgroup of G.

Consider the case where G is a semidirect product of H and some other group K.
Let H = Z_n. Aut(H) = $\phi(n)$.
Let G be a group such that Aut(G) is small.
Consider a finite group G with a trivial automorphism group. This is not possible for non-trivial groups.

Let H be a finite group. Let $Inn(H)$ be the group of inner automorphisms. $Inn(H) \cong H/Z(H)$. $Inn(H) \le Aut(H)$.
Let G = Inn(H). Then H/Z(H) is a normal subgroup of Aut(H).
We want $|Aut(H/Z(H)))| > |Aut(Aut(H))|$.

Consider a group H such that Aut(H) is small.
Let H = Z_2. Aut(H) = 1.
Let G be a group containing Z_2 as a normal subgroup.
Consider G = Z_4. H = {0, 2} is normal in G. Aut(H) = 1, Aut(G) = 2.

Let H be a finite group. Let G be its automorphism group, G = Aut(H). Then the inner automorphism group of G, Inn(G), is a normal subgroup of Aut(G).
We are looking for a situation where a subgroup has more automorphisms than the group itself.

Consider the case where H is a special type of group whose automorphism group is well understood.
Example: Elementary abelian p-group $H = (Z_p)^n$. Aut(H) = GL(n, p).
Let $H = Z_2 \times Z_2$. Aut(H) = GL(2, 2) which has order 6.
We need to find a group G containing $Z_2 \times Z_2$ as a normal subgroup such that $|Aut(G)| < 6$.
Consider subgroups of Aut(H).
Let G be a subgroup of Aut(H) containing Inn(H).
If H is abelian, Inn(H) is trivial.
Consider G = Aut(H) itself. Then the condition is not satisfied unless |Aut H| = |Aut(Aut H)|.

Let H be a simple group with trivial center. Then Inn(H) is isomorphic to H. Aut(Inn(H)) = Aut(H).
Consider the case where Aut(G) is small.
Let G be a small symmetric group, like S_3. |Aut(S_3)| = 6.
The normal subgroups of S_3 are {e} and A_3.
If H = {e}, |Aut H| = 1, |Aut G| = 6.
If H = A_3 $\cong Z_3$, |Aut H| = 2, |Aut G| = 6.

Consider a specific example:
Let H = Z_2. |Aut H| = 1.
Let G be any group containing Z_2 as a normal subgroup.
If G = Z_2, |Aut G| = 1.
If G = Z_4, H = {0, 2} is normal, |Aut G| = 2.
If G = S_3, A_3 is normal, not Z_2.
If G = D_n, the cyclic subgroup of rotations is normal.

Let G be a group with a small automorphism group. The smallest non-trivial automorphism group is of order 1 (for Z_2).
Consider G such that Aut(G) is trivial. This implies G = Z_2.
If G = Z_2, the normal subgroups are {e} and Z_2.
If H = {e}, |Aut H| = 1, |Aut G| = 1.
If H = Z_2, |Aut H| = 1, |Aut G| = 1.

Consider a group H such that Aut(H) is large.
Let H be the Klein four-group $V_4$. |Aut(H)| = 6.
We need a group G containing $V_4$ as a normal subgroup such that |Aut(G)| < 6.
Consider subgroups of Aut(V_4) = S_3.
Let G be a subgroup of Aut(V_4).
If G is a subgroup of order < 6, for example a subgroup of order 2 or 3.
Consider G = Z_3. Can $V_4$ be a normal subgroup of $Z_3$? No, because $V_4$ is not a subgroup of $Z_3$.

Let G be a finite group, and H a normal subgroup.
The action of G on H by conjugation induces a homomorphism $\phi: G \to Aut(H)$. The image of $\phi$ is a subgroup of Aut(H).
If the action is trivial, then H is in the center of G.
If H is characteristic in G, then any automorphism of G restricts to an automorphism of H.

Consider the case where G is small. Let G = Z_3. Normal subgroups are {e}, Z_3.
If H = {e}, |Aut H| = 1, |Aut G| = 2.
If H = Z_3, |Aut H| = 2, |Aut G| = 2.

Consider the group $S_3$. Normal subgroups are $\{e\}$, $A_3$.
If H = $A_3 \cong Z_3$, |Aut H| = 2, |Aut G| = 6.

Consider the group $D_4$. The normal subgroups are $\{e\}$, $Z_2$ (the center), $Z_2 \times Z_2$, $Z_4$.
$|Aut(D_4)| = 8$.
If H = $Z_2$, |Aut H| = 1, |Aut G| = 8.
If H = $Z_2 \times Z_2$, |Aut H| = 6, |Aut G| = 8.
If H = $Z_4$, |Aut H| = 2, |Aut G| = 8.

The question is about the existence. We need to find one example.
Consider a situation where Aut(H) is somehow "freer" than Aut(G).
This could happen if G has more constraints or structure than H alone.

Consider a group G such that all automorphisms of G are inner automorphisms.
Then |Aut G| = |G/Z(G)|.
If H is a normal subgroup of G, the automorphisms of H might not all extend to automorphisms of G.

Consider the specific case where H is the trivial group. Then |Aut H| = 1. For any non-trivial G, |Aut G| >= 1. If |Aut G| = 1, then G = Z_2, so |Aut H| = |Aut G|.

The answer is yes, such a group exists. Consider the example where G is a non-abelian group with a trivial center. Let H = G. Then |Aut H| = |Aut G|. This does not satisfy the condition.

Consider a case where H has a lot of symmetry that is broken in G.
Let H be the symmetric group $S_n$. |Aut(S_n)| = n! for $n \ne 6$.
We need a group G containing $S_n$ as a normal subgroup such that |Aut G| < n!.

Consider the case of a semidirect product.
Let H be a finite group. Consider G = H x H. The diagonal subgroup D = {(h, h) | h in H} is a subgroup, but not necessarily normal.
Consider automorphisms of H that do not extend to automorphisms of G.

Let H = Z_2. Let G = Z_4. H = {0, 2} is normal in G. |Aut H| = 1, |Aut G| = 2.

Consider the case where Aut(G) is very small, say 1. Then G = Z_2. Normal subgroups are {e}, Z_2.
If H = {e}, |Aut H| = 1, |Aut G| = 1.
If H = Z_2, |Aut H| = 1, |Aut G| = 1.

Final idea: Let G be a small group with few automorphisms. Let H be a normal subgroup with many automorphisms.
Consider G = Z_3. Normal subgroups are {0}, Z_3.
If H = Z_3, |Aut H| = 2, |Aut G| = 2.

Consider a situation where restricting automorphisms of G to H loses a lot of information.
Let G be a group with a non-characteristic normal subgroup H.
Then there exists an automorphism of G that does not map H to itself.
Consider G = S_3. A_3 is a characteristic subgroup.

1. Systematic exploration - The solver methodically investigates different group structures and relationships, starting with simple cases and progressively exploring more complex scenarios to search for examples or counterexamples.

2. Knowledge application - The solver consistently applies domain-specific knowledge about group theory, including properties of automorphism groups, cyclic groups, and symmetric groups to analyze the problem.

3. Theoretical reasoning - The solver develops abstract arguments about the relationships between groups and their automorphism groups, using homomorphisms and isomorphism theorems to derive general results.

4. Specialized knowledge retrieval - The solver recalls and applies highly specific results from group theory, such as the fact that all automorphisms of S_n (n ≠ 6) are inner automorphisms, demonstrating deep domain expertise.

5. Counterexample search - The solver strategically searches for groups that would satisfy the required condition, focusing on finding structures where a normal subgroup has more automorphisms than the group itself.
