Problem:
In a resource-limited ecological system, a population of organisms cannot keep growing forever (such as lab bacteria growing inside culture tube). The effective growth rate $g$ (including

contributions from births and deaths) depends on the instantaneous abundance of resource $R(t)$, which in this problem we will consider the simple case of linear-dependency:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} N=g(R) N=\alpha R N
$$

where $N(t)$ is the population size at time $t$. The resources is consumed at a constant rate $\beta$ by each organism:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} R=-\beta N
$$

Initially, the total amount of resources is $R_{0}$ and the population size is $N_{0}$. Given that $\alpha=10^{-9}$ resourceunit $^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}, \beta=1$ resource-unit/s, $R_{0}=10^{6}$ resource-units and $N_{0}=1$ cell, find the total time it takes from the beginning to when all resources are depleted (in hours).

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
We can find the analytical solution for the following set of two ODEs describing the populationresource dynamics:

$$
\frac{d N}{d t}=\alpha R N,
\tag{1}
$$
$$
\frac{d R}{d t}=-\beta N .
\tag{2}
$$

Divide Eq.(1) by Eq.(2) on both sides, we get a direct relation between the population size $N(t)$ and the amount of resource $R(t)$ :

$$
\frac{d N}{d R}=-\frac{\alpha}{\beta} R \Longrightarrow N=N_{0}+\frac{\alpha}{2 \beta}\left(R_{0}^{2}-R^{2}\right)
$$

Plug this in Eq.(2), we obtain the total time $T$ it takes from the beginning to when the resource is depleted:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d R}{d t}=-\frac{\alpha}{2}\left[\left(\frac{2 \beta}{\alpha} N_{0}+R_{0}^{2}\right)-R^{2}\right] \Longrightarrow & \Longrightarrow \\
\left.\right|_{R=0} & =\frac{2}{\alpha} \int_{0}^{R_{0}} d R\left[\left(\frac{2 \beta}{\alpha} N_{0}+R_{0}^{2}\right)-R^{2}\right]^{-1} \\
& =\frac{2}{\alpha \sqrt{\frac{2 \beta}{\alpha} N_{0}+R_{0}^{2}}} \operatorname{arctanh}\left(\frac{R_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{2 \beta}{\alpha} N_{0}+R_{0}^{2}}}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Use the given numerical values, we arrive at $\left.t\right|_{R=0} \approx 7594.3 \mathrm{~s} \approx 2.1095 \mathrm{hrs}$.
