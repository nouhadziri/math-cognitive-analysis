Problem:
Two electromagnetic (em) fields are applied on the 1s->2p transition of a Hydrogen atomic vapor sample.

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let's break down the problem and the physics involved.

**1. Identify the key elements:**

* **Hydrogen Atom:**  The system is a hydrogen atom, meaning we can use its well-known energy levels and wavefunctions. The transition is 1s -> 2p.
* **Electromagnetic Fields:** Two fields are applied.
    * Field #1: Linearly polarized in z, propagating in x. This means the electric field vector is along the z-axis.
    * Field #2: Circularly polarized, propagating in z. This means the electric field vector rotates in the xy-plane.
* **DC Electric Field:**  A static electric field is applied along the z-direction. This will cause a Stark effect.
* **Absorption Probability:** We are interested in the conditions where the absorption probability of both fields is maximum and equal.

**2. Understand the effect of each field and the DC field:**

* **Field #1 (Linear Polarization):**  The z-polarized light will drive transitions where the change in the magnetic quantum number Δm = 0. The 1s state has l=0, m=0. The 2p state has l=1, m = -1, 0, 1. Thus, Field #1 will drive the 1s (m=0) -> 2p (m=0) transition.
* **Field #2 (Circular Polarization):**  Circularly polarized light can drive transitions with Δm = +1 or Δm = -1, depending on the handedness. Let's assume right circular polarization, which corresponds to Δm = +1. This will drive the 1s (m=0) -> 2p (m=+1) transition. Left circular polarization would drive 1s (m=0) -> 2p (m=-1). The problem statement doesn't specify handedness, but the result should be similar for either, just a change in the sign.
* **DC Electric Field (Stark Effect):** The DC electric field along the z-direction will lift the degeneracy of the 2p states. The energy shift is proportional to the projection of the angular momentum along the field direction (the z-axis). The energy shift is given by ΔE = -e E0 <nlm|z|nlm'>. For the 2p states, the shift will be different for m=0 and m=±1.

**3. Consider the resonance condition:**

Maximum absorption probability occurs when the frequency of the applied field matches the energy difference between the initial and final states.

* For Field #1, the resonant frequency w1 corresponds to the energy difference between the 1s state and the shifted 2p (m=0) state.
* For Field #2, the resonant frequency w2 corresponds to the energy difference between the 1s state and the shifted 2p (m=+1 or m=-1) state.

**4. Calculate the Stark shift:**

The energy shift due to the DC electric field is given by the first-order Stark effect. The change in energy for a state |nlm> is ΔE = -e E0 <nlm|z|nlm>.

* For the 1s state (n=1, l=0, m=0):  <100|z|100> = 0. So, there is no first-order Stark shift for the 1s state.
* For the 2p states (n=2, l=1, m=0, ±1):
    * For 2p, m=0: <210|z|210> = some non-zero value. We know the hydrogen atom eigenfunctions. For n=2, l=1, m=0, the wavefunction is proportional to r cos θ.
    * For 2p, m=±1: <21±1|z|21±1> = 0.

Let's evaluate the matrix element <210|z|100> which is relevant for the transition probability but not the energy shift itself. We need the diagonal element for the energy shift.

Let's use the standard hydrogen atom wavefunctions:
* ψ<sub>100</sub> = (1/√(πa<sub>0</sub><sup>3</sup>)) e<sup>-r/a<sub>0</sub></sup>
* ψ<sub>210</sub> = (1/√(32πa<sub>0</sub><sup>5</sup>)) r e<sup>-r/(2a<sub>0</sub>)</sup> cos θ
* ψ<sub>21±1</sub> = ∓ (1/√(64πa<sub>0</sub><sup>5</sup>)) r e<sup>-r/(2a<sub>0</sub>)</sup> sin θ e<sup>±iφ</sup>

The energy shift for the 2p, m=0 state is ΔE<sub>2p,m=0</sub> = -e E0 <210|z|210>.
The energy shift for the 2p, m=±1 states is ΔE<sub>2p,m=±1</sub> = -e E0 <21±1|z|21±1>.

We know that z = r cos θ.

<210|z|210> = ∫ ψ<sub>210</sub>* (r cos θ) ψ<sub>210</sub> dτ
= (1/(32πa<sub>0</sub><sup>5</sup>)) ∫ (r e<sup>-r/(2a<sub>0</sub>)</sup> cos θ) * (r cos θ) * (r e<sup>-r/(2a<sub>0</sub>)</sup> cos θ) r<sup>2</sup> sin θ dr dθ dφ
= (1/(32πa<sub>0</sub><sup>5</sup>)) ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>∞</sup> r<sup>4</sup> e<sup>-r/a<sub>0</sub></sup> dr ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>π</sup> cos<sup>3</sup> θ sin θ dθ ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>2π</sup> dφ

∫<sub>0</sub><sup>2π</sup> dφ = 2π
Let u = cos θ, du = -sin θ dθ
∫<sub>0</sub><sup>π</sup> cos<sup>3</sup> θ sin θ dθ = - ∫<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup> u<sup>3</sup> du = ∫<sub>-1</sub><sup>1</sup> u<sup>3</sup> du = [u<sup>4</sup>/4]<sub>-1</sub><sup>1</sup> = 1/4 - 1/4 = 0.

This seems wrong. The first-order Stark effect *should* exist for the 2p, m=0 state.

Let's rethink the Stark effect formula. The first-order Stark effect is non-zero only when the states are degenerate and have opposite parity. In hydrogen, the 2s and 2p states are degenerate (ignoring Lamb shift). The applied electric field mixes these states.

However, the problem statement talks about the *1s -> 2p* transition, so we are looking at the energy shifts of the 2p states. The degeneracy of the 2p states (m=-1, 0, 1) is lifted by the DC field.

The energy shift for a hydrogen atom in a uniform electric field along the z-axis is given by:
ΔE<sub>n,l,m</sub> = - (3/2) n a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub> m  (This is the linear Stark effect formula, valid for degenerate states)

This formula is applicable to the n=2 manifold where the 2s and 2p states are degenerate. However, since we are considering the 1s -> 2p transition, we are interested in the energy levels of the 2p states in the presence of the DC field.

Let's consider the interaction Hamiltonian with the DC field: H' = -e E0 z. The first-order energy shift is given by the expectation value of H' in the unperturbed state.

ΔE<sub>2p,m</sub> = <ψ<sub>2pm</sub> | -e E0 z | ψ<sub>2pm</sub>> = -e E0 <ψ<sub>2pm</sub> | r cos θ | ψ<sub>2pm</sub>>

For m=0:  ΔE<sub>2p,0</sub> = -e E0 <210|r cos θ|210>
For m=±1: ΔE<sub>2p,±1</sub> = -e E0 <21±1|r cos θ|21±1>

We know that the expectation value of z for states with definite parity is zero unless there's mixing of states with opposite parity. The 2p states have definite parity.

Let's use the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. The interaction Hamiltonian for the em field is -e **r** · **E**.

* For Field #1 (polarized in z):  The interaction is proportional to z. This couples the 1s state (l=0, m=0) to 2p states with Δm = 0, so 2p, m=0.
* For Field #2 (circularly polarized): The interaction is proportional to x ± iy. This couples the 1s state (l=0, m=0) to 2p states with Δm = ±1, so 2p, m=+1 or m=-1.

The energy of the 1s state is E<sub>1s</sub>. The energy of the 2p states without the DC field is E<sub>2p</sub>.

With the DC field, the energy of the 2p, m=0 state is E<sub>2p</sub> + ΔE<sub>0</sub>.
The energy of the 2p, m=±1 states is E<sub>2p</sub> + ΔE<sub>±1</sub>.

The absorption probability is maximum when the photon energy matches the transition energy.

For Field #1: ħw1 = (E<sub>2p</sub> + ΔE<sub>0</sub>) - E<sub>1s</sub>
For Field #2: ħw2 = (E<sub>2p</sub> + ΔE<sub>±1</sub>) - E<sub>1s</sub>

For maximum and equal absorption probability, the transitions should be resonant. The problem implies that the *maximum* absorption probability is equal, suggesting the strengths of the transitions are similar, but the resonance frequencies are what determine when the absorption is maximum.

The Stark shift for hydrogen needs careful consideration. For the n=2 manifold, the linear Stark effect mixes the 2s and 2p states. However, we are looking at the *individual* 2p levels.

The energy shift of the 2p states due to the DC field E0 along the z-direction is:
ΔE<sub>2p,m=0</sub> = 3 e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>
ΔE<sub>2p,m=±1</sub> = - (3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>

These are the shifts relative to the unperturbed 2p energy level.

So, the transition energies are:
For Field #1 (1s -> 2p, m=0):  E<sub>2p</sub> - E<sub>1s</sub> + 3 e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>
For Field #2 (1s -> 2p, m=±1): E<sub>2p</sub> - E<sub>1s</sub> - (3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>

For maximum absorption, the photon energies must match these transition energies:
ħw1 = E<sub>2p</sub> - E<sub>1s</sub> + 3 e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>
ħw2 = E<sub>2p</sub> - E<sub>1s</sub> - (3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>

We are given that the maximum absorption probabilities are equal. This implies that the transition strengths are similar and the fields are strong enough to saturate the transitions. The key is that the resonance conditions are met at w1 and w2.

We are asked to find w2 such that the maximum absorption probabilities are equal. This condition will be met when the fields are on resonance with their respective transitions.

If the maximum absorption probabilities are equal, it means that at these frequencies, the transitions are driven effectively.

The problem asks for the value of w2. We need to relate the absorption probabilities. The absorption rate is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the interaction Hamiltonian and a Lorentzian function centered at the resonance frequency.

Absorption rate ∝ |<f| -e **r** · **E** |i>|^2 * g(ω - ω<sub>0</sub>)

Here, g(ω - ω<sub>0</sub>) is the lineshape function. For maximum absorption, ω = ω<sub>0</sub>.

For Field #1: ω<sub>0,1</sub> = (E<sub>2p</sub> - E<sub>1s</sub> + 3 e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>) / ħ
For Field #2: ω<sub>0,2</sub> = (E<sub>2p</sub> - E<sub>1s</sub> - (3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>) / ħ

We are given that the maximum absorption probabilities are equal. This means that the peak of the absorption spectrum for both transitions has the same height. This usually implies that the transition dipole moments are similar (which they are for 1s->2p transitions with Δm=0 and Δm=±1).

The problem statement is somewhat ambiguous about what "maximum and equal" implies. It likely means that the fields are tuned to their respective resonance frequencies, and at these resonances, the peak absorption rates are equal.

If the peak absorption rates are equal, then at resonance, the factors other than the frequency matching are equal.

We need to find w2 such that this condition is met. The condition "maximum absorption" implies resonance.

The wording suggests we need to find w2 when the absorption probabilities are maximized *and* these maxima are equal. This happens when w1 and w2 are tuned to the shifted transition frequencies.

The difference in the transition frequencies is:
Δω = ω<sub>0,1</sub> - ω<sub>0,2</sub> = (3 e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub> - (-3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>) / ħ = (9/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub> / ħ

We are given the values of w1 and w2. The question asks for the value of w2. The condition of equal maximum absorption probability implies that w1 is resonant with the 1s -> 2p (m=0) transition and w2 is resonant with the 1s -> 2p (m=±1) transition.

So, w1 = (E<sub>2p</sub> - E<sub>1s</sub> + 3 e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>) / ħ
w2 = (E<sub>2p</sub> - E<sub>1s</sub> - (3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>) / ħ

We need to express w2 in terms of E0, a0, and e. The question implies a specific numerical factor.

Consider the energy difference between the two shifted 2p levels:
ΔE = (E<sub>2p</sub> + 3 e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>) - (E<sub>2p</sub> - (3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>) = (9/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>

This energy difference corresponds to the difference between the frequencies w1 and w2:
ħ(w1 - w2) = (9/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>
w1 - w2 = (9/2) (e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub> / ħ)

The problem states that the wave vector amplitudes are equal, which means the frequencies are likely close.

Let's consider the absorption probability more formally. In the weak field limit, the absorption probability is proportional to the intensity of the light and the transition rate.

The transition rate is proportional to |<f| -e **r** · **E** |i>|^2 δ(E<sub>f</sub> - E<sub>i</sub> - ħω).

The maximum absorption occurs when ħω matches the energy difference.

The problem is asking for the value of w2 under the condition of equal maximum absorption. This equality occurs when w1 and w2 are at their respective resonance frequencies.

We have:
w1 = ω<sub>0</sub> + 3 (e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub> / ħ)
w2 = ω<sub>0</sub> - (3/2) (e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub> / ħ)
where ω<sub>0</sub> = (E<sub>2p</sub> - E<sub>1s</sub>) / ħ is the unperturbed transition frequency.

The question asks for w2 itself. There seems to be a missing piece or a simplification assumed in the answer choices.

The answer choices are in the form of a factor multiplied by e a0 E0. This suggests the frequencies are directly proportional to this quantity, implying that w1 and w2 are measured relative to the unperturbed transition frequency.

If we interpret the question as asking for the *shift* of w2 from the unperturbed frequency, then:
Shift of w1 = 3 (e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub> / ħ)
Shift of w2 = - (3/2) (e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub> / ħ)

However, the question asks for w2 itself.

Let's look at the energy level diagram with the Stark effect:
- 2p, m=1: E<sub>2p</sub> - (3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>
- 2p, m=0: E<sub>2p</sub> + 3 e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>
- 2p, m=-1: E<sub>2p</sub> - (3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>

Transition 1 (z-polarized): 1s -> 2p, m=0. Resonant frequency w1 ∝ E<sub>2p</sub> - E<sub>1s</sub> + 3 e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>
Transition 2 (circularly polarized): 1s -> 2p, m=+1 (or -1). Resonant frequency w2 ∝ E<sub>2p</sub> - E<sub>1s</sub> - (3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>

The proportionality constant is 1/ħ.

If the maximum absorption probabilities are equal, it means the fields are on resonance.

The question implies that w2 is *given by* one of the options when this condition is met. This suggests that w2 is directly related to the Stark shift.

Let's assume the question is asking for the scenario where the two fields drive transitions to states that are equally shifted by the DC field, leading to equal resonance frequencies. This interpretation doesn't seem to fit the setup.

The most straightforward interpretation is that w1 is resonant with the 1s -> 2p (m=0) transition, and w2 is resonant with the 1s -> 2p (m=±1) transition, and we need to find the value of w2.

The answer choices suggest a direct proportionality between w2 and e a0 E0. This might imply that the problem is simplified or looking at the relative frequency shift.

Could the question mean that the *absorption peak frequencies* are such that the maximum absorption is equal? Yes, this is the most likely interpretation.

Let's re-examine the Stark shifts:
ΔE<sub>2p,m=0</sub> = 3 e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>
ΔE<sub>2p,m=±1</sub> = - (3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>

The frequencies for maximum absorption are:
w1 = ω<sub>0</sub> + 3 (e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub> / ħ)
w2 = ω<sub>0</sub> - (3/2) (e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub> / ħ)

The question is about the value of w2 itself. The answer choices suggest that w2 is directly proportional to e a0 E0. This only makes sense if the unperturbed transition frequency ω<sub>0</sub> is being ignored or somehow normalized out.

If the question meant the *shift* in frequency, then the magnitudes are 3 and 1.5, not among the choices.

Perhaps the question is subtly about matching the transition energies through tuning w2. If the maximum absorption probabilities are equal, it means the fields are effectively driving the transitions.

Consider the scenario where w1 = w2. This would require the Stark shifts to be equal, which is not the case.

The phrasing "if the frequency w2 is given by" suggests a specific condition.

Let's look at the energy difference between the 2p levels: 3 e a0 E0 - (-1.5 e a0 E0) = 4.5 e a0 E0.
If w1 = w2, then the energy difference between the final states must be zero.

If the maximum absorption probabilities are equal, it implies that at these frequencies, the system absorbs photons equally well.

Consider the center of the Stark splitting: E<sub>2p</sub> + (3 - 1.5)/2 e a0 E0 = E<sub>2p</sub> + 0.75 e a0 E0.
If w2 were equal to the transition frequency to this "average" level, it wouldn't make sense in the context of driving specific transitions.

The answer choices have numerical factors. Let's test them.

If w2 = C * e a0 E0, where C is the numerical factor. This form suggests that w2 is a measure of the Stark shift itself.

Could the question be about some interference effect or matching conditions?

The most plausible interpretation is that the question asks for the value of w2 when it is tuned to the transition 1s -> 2p (m=±1), which has a frequency shift of -1.5 (e a0 E0 / ħ). However, the answer choices don't directly reflect this.

Let's assume the problem implies a scenario where the energy spacing between the split 2p levels plays a role. The splitting is 4.5 e a0 E0.

If w2 is related to this splitting, maybe through some averaging or specific combination.

Consider the average frequency shift: (3 - 1.5)/2 = 0.75. Not in the options.

If the question means the *magnitude* of the shifts are considered, then 3 and 1.5.

Perhaps there's a factor of ħ missing in my calculations or the answer choices are implicitly in units of (e a0 E0 / ħ).

Let's assume the answer choices represent w2 * ħ / (e a0 E0).

If w2 = 1.5 * (e a0 E0 / ħ), then the factor is 1.5. Not an option.

Could there be a factor related to the dipole moments or Clebsch-Gordan coefficients? The transitions are allowed.

The energy difference between the 2p m=0 and m=±1 states is 4.5 e a0 E0.

If w2 is related to this splitting:
(A) 8.7 ≈ 2 * 4.5
(B) 3
(C) 5.1 ≈ 4.5 + 0.6
(D) 11.54 ≈ 2.5 * 4.5

Consider the energy levels relative to the unperturbed 2p level. The transitions from 1s to these levels have frequencies relative to the unperturbed transition frequency.

The frequency difference is w1 - w2 = 4.5 (e a0 E0 / ħ).

If the maximum absorption probabilities are equal, it means the fields are on resonance.

Let's assume the question is poorly worded and asks for a quantity related to the Stark splitting. The total splitting is 4.5 e a0 E0. None of the options directly match this.

Let's review the first option: 8.7 e a0 E0. If this equals ħw2, then w2 = 8.7 e a0 E0 / ħ. This doesn't directly correspond to a transition frequency.

Final thought: The question likely asks for the value of w2 such that it corresponds to a transition energy involving a Stark-shifted level, and the condition of equal maximum absorption means w1 and w2 are tuned to their respective resonances. The discrepancy lies in how the answer choices are formulated. They seem to be missing the base transition frequency.

If the question is about the *shift* in frequency, none of the options match 3 or 1.5.

Consider the average energy of the split levels relative to the unperturbed 2p: 0.75 e a0 E0. Multiplied by 2 gives 1.5.

Let's assume the question asks for w2 such that ħw2 corresponds to some characteristic energy of the Stark splitting.

Option (A) is roughly 2 times the total splitting.
Option (B) is close to the magnitude of one of the shifts.
Option (C) is a bit more than the total splitting.
Option (D) is much larger.

The most likely scenario is a misunderstanding of what the question is asking for, or a missing factor of ħ. If the options represent ħw2, and we consider the energy differences, none match directly.

If the question is about when the *magnitudes* of the frequency shifts are related, then |w1 - ω0| = 3 X and |w2 - ω0| = 1.5 X, where X = e a0 E0 / ħ.

Could the question involve Rabi frequencies? Maximum absorption relates to Rabi frequency.

Let's assume the answer choices are proportional to the energy difference between the Stark-split levels. The difference is 4.5 e a0 E0. None of the choices directly match this.

The closest option to a simple multiple of the base unit e a0 E0 is (B) 3. This corresponds to the magnitude of the shift of the m=0 level. However, w2 is associated with the m=±1 levels.

<text>This seems wrong. The first-order Stark effect *should* exist for the 2p, m=0 state.

Let's rethink the Stark effect formula.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that their calculation result contradicts their physical understanding of the Stark effect. Instead of proceeding with what they suspect is an incorrect result, they explicitly acknowledge the potential error and decide to reconsider their approach. This demonstrates critical self-evaluation and willingness to revise their reasoning.</explanation>

<text>Let's consider the interaction Hamiltonian with the DC field: H' = -e E0 z. The first-order energy shift is given by the expectation value of H' in the unperturbed state.

ΔE<sub>2p,m</sub> = <ψ<sub>2pm</sub> | -e E0 z | ψ<sub>2pm</sub>> = -e E0 <ψ<sub>2pm</sub> | r cos θ | ψ<sub>2pm</sub>></text>
<explanation>After detecting a potential error in their approach, the solver returns to fundamental principles by explicitly writing out the interaction Hamiltonian and the formal expression for the first-order energy shift. This shows the ability to reset their approach when encountering difficulties and return to established theoretical foundations.</explanation>

<text>The Stark shift for hydrogen needs careful consideration. For the n=2 manifold, the linear Stark effect mixes the 2s and 2p states. However, we are looking at the *individual* 2p levels.

The energy shift of the 2p states due to the DC field E0 along the z-direction is:</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes a conceptual subtlety in applying the Stark effect to hydrogen atoms. They distinguish between the general treatment of the n=2 manifold and the specific focus on individual 2p levels required by this problem. This shows metacognitive awareness and the ability to refine their conceptual approach based on the specific problem context.</explanation>

<text>**3. Consider the resonance condition:**

Maximum absorption probability occurs when the frequency of the applied field matches the energy difference between the initial and final states.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies a key principle that will guide their approach to the problem - the resonance condition. By recognizing that maximum absorption occurs at resonance, they establish a strategic framework for determining the relationship between frequencies and energy levels, which is central to solving the problem.</explanation>

<text>* For Field #1, the resonant frequency w1 corresponds to the energy difference between the 1s state and the shifted 2p (m=0) state.
* For Field #2, the resonant frequency w2 corresponds to the energy difference between the 1s state and the shifted 2p (m=+1 or m=-1) state.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies the resonance principle to each specific field, mapping out how the resonant frequencies relate to the energy differences between specific quantum states. This demonstrates strategic thinking by creating a clear framework for determining the conditions that will lead to maximum absorption.</explanation>

<text>ΔE<sub>2p,m=0</sub> = 3 e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>
ΔE<sub>2p,m=±1</sub> = - (3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub></text>
<explanation>After working through multiple approaches and considerations, the solver arrives at specific numerical expressions for the energy shifts. This represents a key strategic milestone in the solution process, as these values will directly determine the resonant frequencies and ultimately the answer to the problem.</explanation>

<text>These are the shifts relative to the unperturbed 2p energy level.

So, the transition energies are:
For Field #1 (1s -> 2p, m=0):  E<sub>2p</sub> - E<sub>1s</sub> + 3 e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>
For Field #2 (1s -> 2p, m=±1): E<sub>2p</sub> - E<sub>1s</sub> - (3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub></text>
<explanation>The solver strategically combines the unperturbed transition energy with the calculated Stark shifts to determine the complete transition energies for each field. This demonstrates the ability to systematically build toward the solution by integrating multiple components of the analysis.</explanation>

<text>The problem is asking for the value of w2 under the condition of equal maximum absorption. This equality occurs when w1 and w2 are at their respective resonance frequencies.

We have:
w1 = ω<sub>0</sub> + 3 (e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub> / ħ)
w2 = ω<sub>0</sub> - (3/2) (e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub> / ħ)
where ω<sub>0</sub> = (E<sub>2p</sub> - E<sub>1s</sub>) / ħ is the unperturbed transition frequency.</text>
<explanation>The solver formulates a specific hypothesis about what "equal maximum absorption" means in this context - that both fields are at their respective resonance frequencies. They then express this mathematically, showing how w1 and w2 relate to the unperturbed frequency and the Stark shifts. This demonstrates the ability to translate a physical interpretation into a testable mathematical form.</explanation>

<start>10175</start>
<end>10505</end>
<text>Let's assume the question is asking for the *shift* of w2 from the unperturbed frequency, then:
Shift of w1 = 3 (e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub> / ħ)
Shift of w2 = - (3/2) (e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub> / ħ)

However, the question asks for w2 itself.

Let's look at the energy level diagram with the Stark effect:
- 2p, m=1: E<sub>2p</sub> - (3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>
- 2p, m=0: E<sub>2p</sub> + 3 e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub>
- 2p, m=-1: E<sub>2p</sub> - (3/2) e a<sub>0</sub> E<sub>0</sub></text>
<explanation>The solver tests a hypothesis about what the question might be asking for (the shift rather than the absolute frequency), but then recognizes this interpretation may not be correct. They then create a visual model of the energy levels to help clarify their thinking. This shows the ability to generate and evaluate alternative interpretations of the problem.</explanation>

<start>12179</start>
<end>12450</end>
<text>If the maximum absorption probabilities are equal, it means the fields are on resonance.

The question implies that w2 is *given by* one of the options when this condition is met. This suggests that w2 is directly related to the Stark shift.

Let's assume the question is asking for the scenario where the two fields drive transitions to states that are equally shifted by the DC field</text>
<explanation>The solver formulates another hypothesis about what
