Problem:
Jackie and Phil have two fair coins and a third coin that comes up heads with probability $\frac47$ . Jackie flips the three coins, and then Phil flips the three coins. Let $\frac {m}{n}$ be the probability that Jackie gets the same number of heads as Phil, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$ .

Domain: Number theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so the problem is about Jackie and Phil each flipping three coins. Two of the coins are fair, and the third has a probability of 4/7 of landing heads. We need to find the probability that Jackie and Phil get the same number of heads, and then express that probability as a reduced fraction m/n, finally giving m + n as the answer.

First, I need to figure out the probability distribution for the number of heads when flipping these three coins. Since there are two fair coins and one biased coin, the number of heads can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Let's denote X as the random variable representing the number of heads in a single set of three flips by either Jackie or Phil. Our goal is to compute P(X_Jackie = X_Phil), which is the probability that both get the same number of heads.

Since both Jackie and Phil are flipping the same set of coins independently, their results are independent. Therefore, the probability that they have the same number of heads is the sum over all k from 0 to 3 of [P(X = k)]2. That is, we compute P(X=0)^2 + P(X=1)^2 + P(X=2)^2 + P(X=3)^2. So the first step is to calculate P(X=k) for each k = 0,1,2,3.

Given that there are three coins: let's break it down. Let me denote the coins as Coin A (fair, P(heads)=1/2), Coin B (fair, P(heads)=1/2), and Coin C (biased, P(heads)=4/7). Since the coins are flipped independently, the total probability of getting k heads is the sum over all combinations of k heads among the three coins, multiplied by their respective probabilities.

So for each k, there are (number of ways to choose k coins) combinations. Let me consider k=0 first:

For k=0: All three coins must be tails. So the probability is P(A=T)P(B=T)P(C=T) = (1/2)(1/2)(3/7) since the biased coin's probability of tails is 1 - 4/7 = 3/7. So that's (1/2)^2 * 3/7 = (1/4)*(3/7) = 3/28.

For k=1: There are three possibilities: either Coin A is heads and the others are tails, or Coin B is heads and the others are tails, or Coin C is heads and the others are tails. Let's compute each:

1. A=H, B=T, C=T: (1/2)(1/2)(3/7) = (1/4)(3/7) = 3/28
2. B=H, A=T, C=T: Similarly, 3/28
3. C=H, A=T, B=T: (1/2)(1/2)(4/7) = (1/4)(4/7) = 4/28 = 1/7

Adding these up: 3/28 + 3/28 + 1/7 = 3/28 + 3/28 + 4/28 = 10/28 = 5/14.

Wait, hold on: 3+3+4 is 10, over 28, which simplifies to 5/14. Correct.

For k=2: Similarly, three possibilities: two heads and one tail. The two heads can be on A and B, A and C, or B and C.

1. A=H, B=H, C=T: (1/2)(1/2)(3/7) = 3/28
2. A=H, C=H, B=T: (1/2)(4/7)(1/2) = (1/2*1/2*4/7) = 4/28 = 1/7
3. B=H, C=H, A=T: Similarly, 1/7
So 3/28 + 1/7 + 1/7 = 3/28 + 4/28 + 4/28 = 11/28.

Wait: Let's check:

First combination: A and B heads, C tails: (1/2)(1/2)(3/7) = 3/28

Second: A and C heads, B tails: (1/2)(4/7)(1/2) = (1/2*1/2*4/7) = (1/4)(4/7) = 1/7, which is 4/28.

Third: B and C heads, A tails: (1/2)(4/7)(1/2) = same as above, 4/28.

Thus total is 3 + 4 + 4 = 11 over 28, so 11/28 for k=2.

k=3: All three coins heads. So the probability is (1/2)(1/2)(4/7) = 4/28 = 1/7.

Wait:

P(A=H)P(B=H)P(C=H) = (1/2)(1/2)(4/7) = 1/4 * 4/7 = 1/7. That's correct.

So summarizing:

P(X=0) = 3/28,

P(X=1) = 5/14 = 10/28,

P(X=2) = 11/28,

P(X=3) = 1/7 = 4/28.

Let me verify that these sum up to 1.

3/28 + 10/28 + 11/28 + 4/28 = (3 + 10 + 11 + 4)/28 = 28/28 = 1. Perfect, that checks out.

Now, for the probability that Jackie and Phil have the same number of heads, which is the sum of squares of each probability:

(3/28)2 + (10/28)2 + (11/28)2 + (4/28)2.

Alternatively, factor out 1/282:

[9 + 100 + 121 + 16] / 282

Compute numerator:

9 + 100 = 109

109 + 121 = 230

230 + 16 = 246

So 246/(282) = 246/784.

Now, let's simplify 246/784.

First, divide numerator and denominator by 2: 123/392

Check if 123 and 392 share any common factors.

123 factors: 3 * 41.

392 factors: 2^3 * 7^2.

No common factors, so 123/392 is reduced fraction.

But wait, 392 = 16*24.5? Wait, 16 *24.5 is 392? No, 16 *24 is 384, 16*25=400, so no. Let's actually compute 392 divided by 3: 3*130=390, remainder 2. Not divisible. 392 divided by 41? 41*9 = 369, 41*9 +23 = 392. Not divisible by 41. So yes, 123 and 392 share no common factors besides 1, so m/n is 123/392.

But let me check again, perhaps I made an error in calculation.

Wait, wait the original total is P(X=0)^2 + ... How did P(X=0) get squared as (3/28)^2?

Wait, but wait, so originally each of their trials is independent, so the probability that they both get k heads is [P(X=k)]^2, so total probability is sum over k [P(X=k)]2.

So indeed, it's [ (3/28)^2 + (10/28)^2 + (11/28)^2 + (4/28)^2 ].

Wait, wait, 3 + 10 +11 +4 is 28, but squared terms are 9 +100 +121 +16, which is 246, right.

Therefore total is 246/(28^2). 28^2 is 784. 246 divided by 784. Reduction: GCD(246,784).

Prime factors:

246 = 2 * 123 = 2 * 3 *41.

784 = 16 * 49 = 16 *7*7.

So GCD is 2, since only common factor.

Wait, 246 is 2*123, 784 is 2*392. So GCD(246,784) = 2. Therefore, divide numerator and denominator by 2.

246/2 = 123, 784/2 = 392.

So yes, 123/392. 123 is 3*41, 392 is 2^3 *7^2. No common factors. Therefore, m =123, n=392.

So 123 + 392 = 515.

But hold on. Let's make sure that my computation of the probabilities is correct.

Let me confirm the individual P(X=k):

For k=0:

All three coins must be tails.

Fair coins have probability 1/2 tails, biased coin has 3/7 tails.

So (1/2)*(1/2)*(3/7) = (1/4)*(3/7) = 3/28. Correct.

For k=1:

Three scenarios: head on first fair, head on second fair, head on biased.

First fair: H, then T on second, T on biased. So (1/2)*(1/2)*(3/7) = 3/28.

Second fair: T on first, H on second, T on biased: same as above, 3/28.

Biased: T on first, T on second, H on biased: (1/2)*(1/2)*(4/7) = 4/28.

Total: 3 + 3 +4 =10 /28 =5/14. Correct.

For k=2:

Three scenarios: two heads, one tail.

Either both fair coins and tail on biased: (1/2)*(1/2)*(3/7)=3/28.

Or first fair and biased heads, tail on second: (1/2)*(4/7)*(1/2) =4/28.

Or second fair and biased heads, tail on first: same as above, 4/28.

Total: 3 +4 +4=11 /28. Correct.

For k=3:

All heads. (1/2)*(1/2)*(4/7)=4/28 =1/7. Correct.

So the individual probabilities are correct. Then the sum of squares:

(3/28)^2=(9)/(784)

(10/28)^2=100/784

(11/28)^2=121/784

(4/28)^2=16/784.

Total: 9 +100 +121 +16= 246 over 784, simplifies to 123/392.

Indeed. Thus m = 123, n=392, m+n= 515.

Wait. Before I conclude, I need to confirm once more that GCD(123,392)=1.

123=3*41; 392=2^3*7^2. 3,41 are primes, and 2 and 7 are different primes, so yes, no common factors.

Thus 123/392 is reduced, so answer is 123 +392=515.

Hmm, but the system says "Jackie flips the three coins, and then Phil flips the three coins." Since both are flipping the same set of three coins (two fair, one biased). So in this setup, all coins are the same as per each person's three flips. So the probability distributions are same for both, so problem is symmetric.

Therefore, the probability that both have the same number of heads is sum_{k=0}^3 [ P(X=k) ]2, which we calculated correctly. Then resulting as 123/392.

But we need to check the arithmetic once more. 3^2 +10^2 +11^2 +4^2=9+100+121+16.

9+100=109; 109+121=230; 230+16=246.

Yes, 246. Divided by 28^2=784, simplify to 123/392. Then 123 +392= 515.

But let's check, some other way. Maybe think of generating functions?

The generating function for the number of heads would be: for each coin, (probability of tails + probability of heads z). So two fair coins and one biased.

The generating function would be:

( (1/2 + 1/2 z) )^2 * (3/7 +4/7 z).

Let's expand that:

First, (1/2 + 1/2 z)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 z + 1/4 z2.

Multiplying by (3/7 + 4/7 z):

First, 1/4 * (3/7 + 4/7 z) = 3/28 + 4/28 z

Then, 1/2 z * (3/7 +4/7 z) = 3/14 z +4/14 z2

Then, 1/4 z2 * (3/7 +4/7 z)=3/28 z2 +4/28 z3

Combine like terms:

Constant term: 3/28

z term: 4/28 z +3/14 z = 4/28 z +6/28 z = 10/28 z

z2 term: 4/14 z2 +3/28 z2 = (8/28 + 3/28)z2 =11/28 z2

z3 term: 4/28 z3

Hence, the generating function is 3/28 +10/28 z +11/28 z2 +4/28 z3, which matches the probabilities we had: P(X=0)=3/28, P(X=1)=10/28, etc. So the generating function confirms that.

Then, the probability generating function is correct, so our probabilities were correctly calculated. Therefore sum of squares is correct, leading to 246/784=123/392=>

Hence the answer is 515.

\boxed{515}

<text>So for each k, there are (number of ways to choose k coins) combinations. Let me consider k=0 first:

For k=0: All three coins must be tails. So the probability is P(A=T)P(B=T)P(C=T) = (1/2)(1/2)(3/7) since the biased coin's probability of tails is 1 - 4/7 = 3/7. So that's (1/2)^2 * 3/7 = (1/4)*(3/7) = 3/28.</text>

1. A=H, B=T, C=T: (1/2)(1/2)(3/7) = (1/4)(3/7) = 3/28
2. B=H, A=T, C=T: Similarly, 3/28
3. C=H, A=T, B=T: (1/2)(1/2)(4/7) = (1/4)(4/7) = 4/28 = 1/7

2. A=H, C=H, B=T: (1/2)(4/7)(1/2) = (1/2*1/2*4/7) = 4/28 = 1/7

Third: B and C heads, A tails: (1/2)(4/7)(1/2) = same as above, 4/28.

All three coins must be tails.

Fair coins have probability 1/2 tails, biased coin has 3/7 tails.

So (1/2)*(1/2)*(3/7) = (1/4)*(3/7) = 3/28. Correct.

For k=1:

Three scenarios: head on first fair, head on second fair, head on biased.

First fair: H, then T on second, T on biased. So (1/2)*(1/2)*(3/7) = 3/28.

Second fair: T on first, H on second, T on biased: same as above, 3/28.
