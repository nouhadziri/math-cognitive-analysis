Problem:
Which one of the following in NOT a constraint for detection of very massive black holes with microlensing technique?
Answer Choices:
(A) Wavelength at which the event is observed
(B) Mass of the lensed objects and the duration of the event
(C) Duration of microlensing event due to very massive black hole
(D) Mass of the lensed object

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Microlensing is a geometric phenomenon and does not depend on the wavelength at which the event is being observed. So a microlensing event is wavelength independent and wavelength is not a constrain for such observations.
On the other hand, timescale of a microlensing event is a function of the mass of the lensed object. In other words, microlensing event takes longer for more massive objects. On the other hand, telescope time is usually limited and they cannot be used for decades of observations. So, mass of the lensed object and duration of microlensing events are both a limiting factor for detection of very massive black holes.
