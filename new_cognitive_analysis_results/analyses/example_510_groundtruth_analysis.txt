Problem:
In a cycloaddition reaction, two Ï€ systems combine to form a single-ring structure. These reactions can occur under two conditions including thermal and photochemical. These reactions follow the general mechanism given below.
Ethene + ethene (Heat) ----- cyclobutane
Mention the cycloaddition products of the following reactions.
(E)-penta-1,3-diene + acrylonitrile  ---> A
cyclopentadiene + methyl acrylate (Heat) ---> B
Answer Choices:
(A) A = cyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-carbonitrile, B = methyl (1R,2R,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate
(B) A = cyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-carbonitrile, B = methyl (1R,2S,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate
(C) A = 5-methylcyclohex-3-ene-1-carbonitrile, B = methyl (1R,2R,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate
(D) A = 5-methylcyclohex-3-ene-1-carbonitrile, B = methyl (1R,2S,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
A. In this reaction, (E)-penta-1,3-diene acts as the diene, and acrylonitrile acts as the dienophile. The cycloaddition of this reaction produces 5-methylcyclohex-3-ene-1-carbonitrile as a product.
B. When the electron-withdrawing group is present in the terminal carbon of diene, the geometry of the electron-withdrawing would be Cis. So by the cycloaddition reaction of cyclopentadiene and methyl acrylate, methyl (1R,2R,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate will be produced as a product. methyl (1R,2R,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate is the correct answer for the major product due to endo addition being favored.
