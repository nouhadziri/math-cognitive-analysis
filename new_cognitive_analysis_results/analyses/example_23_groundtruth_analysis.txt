Problem:
Imagine a radioactive nuclei X(Z,A) can decay into Y(Z-2, A-4) by emitting an alpha particle with partial half life 3.0 minutes. X(Z,A) can also decay into Q(Z+1,A) by decaying a $\beta^-$ with partial half life 0.098 minutes. If the initial number of X nuclei were 5*10^34 then what is the activity of $\alpha$ decay after 10 minutes? Note, here Z is proton number and A is mass number. 

Answer Choices:
(A) 1.911*10^31 Bq
(B) 3.719 Bq
(C) 113.837 Bq
(D) 117.555 Bq

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
The activity equation for such partial decay activity (in alpha decay mode) is $\dfrac{dN_{\alpha}}{dt} = N_o \lambda_{\alpha} e^{-(\lambda_{\alpha}+\lambda_{\beta})t}$. One may get confused with either using $\lambda_{Total}$ before exponentiation or only $\lambda_{\alpha}$ in the exponentiation. Before applying this equation one needs to convert the half life into the corresponding decay constant $\lambda_{\alpha}$ and $\lambda_{\beta}$. Using the obtained numerical values in the given equation one gets ~3.719 disintegration/Second.
