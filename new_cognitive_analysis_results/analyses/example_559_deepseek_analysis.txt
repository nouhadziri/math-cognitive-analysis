Problem:
Let H be a Hilbert space over the field of real numbers  $\Bbb R$ . Find all  $f: H \to \Bbb R$  continuous functions for which  $$ f(x + y + \pi z) + f(x + \sqrt{2} z) + f(y + \sqrt{2} z) + f (\pi z) $$    $$ = f(x + y + \sqrt{2} z) + f (x + \pi z) + f (y + \pi z) + f(\sqrt{2} z) $$  is satisfied for any  $x , y , z \in H$ .



Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find all continuous functions \( f: H \to \mathbb{R} \) where \( H \) is a real Hilbert space, and the given functional equation holds for any \( x, y, z \in H \). The equation is:

\[ f(x + y + \pi z) + f(x + \sqrt{2} z) + f(y + \sqrt{2} z) + f(\pi z) \]
\[ = f(x + y + \sqrt{2} z) + f(x + \pi z) + f(y + \pi z) + f(\sqrt{2} z) \]

Hmm. First, functional equations often require substituting specific values for variables to simplify them. Since the equation must hold for all \( x, y, z \in H \), maybe choosing some particular \( x \), \( y \), or \( z \) can help reduce the equation and reveal the form of \( f \).

Let me first check if linear functions satisfy this. Suppose \( f(u) = \langle a, u \rangle + b \), where \( a \in H \) is a fixed vector and \( b \in \mathbb{R} \). Let's plug this into the equation and see if both sides are equal.

Left-hand side (LHS):
\[ \langle a, x + y + \pi z \rangle + b + \langle a, x + \sqrt{2} z \rangle + b + \langle a, y + \sqrt{2} z \rangle + b + \langle a, \pi z \rangle + b \]
Simplifying:
\[ \langle a, x + y + \pi z + x + \sqrt{2} z + y + \sqrt{2} z + \pi z \rangle + 4b \]
Combine like terms:
\[ \langle a, 2x + 2y + (\pi + \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} + \pi) z \rangle + 4b \]
Which simplifies to:
\[ \langle a, 2x + 2y + (2\pi + 2\sqrt{2}) z \rangle + 4b \]

Right-hand side (RHS):
\[ \langle a, x + y + \sqrt{2} z \rangle + b + \langle a, x + \pi z \rangle + b + \langle a, y + \pi z \rangle + b + \langle a, \sqrt{2} z \rangle + b \]
Simplifying:
\[ \langle a, x + y + \sqrt{2} z + x + \pi z + y + \pi z + \sqrt{2} z \rangle + 4b \]
Combine like terms:
\[ \langle a, 2x + 2y + (\sqrt{2} + \pi + \pi + \sqrt{2}) z \rangle + 4b \]
Simplifies to:
\[ \langle a, 2x + 2y + (2\pi + 2\sqrt{2}) z \rangle + 4b \]

So both sides are equal! That means linear functions of the form \( f(u) = \langle a, u \rangle + b \) satisfy the equation. Hmm, this suggests linear functions are solutions. Maybe affine functions in general, since adding a constant also works here.

But are there more solutions? Quadratic functions are a common next step in functional equations, especially in Hilbert spaces where inner products naturally lead to quadratic forms. Let me check if quadratic functions could work. Suppose \( f(u) = \langle u, u \rangle \), the squared norm. Let's compute LHS and RHS.

LHS:
\[ \|x + y + \pi z\|^2 + \|x + \sqrt{2} z\|^2 + \|y + \sqrt{2} z\|^2 + \|\pi z\|^2 \]

RHS:
\[ \|x + y + \sqrt{2} z\|^2 + \|x + \pi z\|^2 + \|y + \pi z\|^2 + \|\sqrt{2} z\|^2 \]

Let me compute the difference LHS - RHS:

Expand each term using the identity \( \|a + b\|^2 = \|a\|^2 + \|b\|^2 + 2\langle a, b \rangle \).

First, expanding LHS:

1. \(\|x + y + \pi z\|^2 = \|x\|^2 + \|y\|^2 + \|\pi z\|^2 + 2\langle x, y \rangle + 2\langle x, \pi z \rangle + 2\langle y, \pi z \rangle\)
2. \(\|x + \sqrt{2} z\|^2 = \|x\|^2 + \|\sqrt{2} z\|^2 + 2\langle x, \sqrt{2} z \rangle\)
3. \(\|y + \sqrt{2} z\|^2 = \|y\|^2 + \|\sqrt{2} z\|^2 + 2\langle y, \sqrt{2} z \rangle\)
4. \(\|\pi z\|^2 = \pi^2 \|z\|^2\)

Adding them together:
Total LHS = \( \|x\|^2 + \|y\|^2 + \pi^2 \|z\|^2 + 2\langle x, y \rangle + 2\langle x, \pi z \rangle + 2\langle y, \pi z \rangle + \|x\|^2 + 2\|z\|^2 + 2\langle x, \sqrt{2} z \rangle + \|y\|^2 + 2\|z\|^2 + 2\langle y, \sqrt{2} z \rangle + \pi^2\|z\|^2 \)

Combine like terms:
LHS = \( 2\|x\|^2 + 2\|y\|^2 + (\pi^2 + 2 + 2 + \pi^2)\|z\|^2 + 2\langle x, y \rangle + 2\pi \langle x, z \rangle + 2\pi \langle y, z \rangle + 2\sqrt{2} \langle x, z \rangle + 2\sqrt{2} \langle y, z \rangle \)

Simplify the coefficients:
For \( \|z\|^2 \): \( 2\pi^2 + 4 \)
For the inner product terms: Coefficients of \( \langle x, y \rangle \) is 2; coefficients for \( \langle x, z \rangle \) and \( \langle y, z \rangle \) are \( 2\pi + 2\sqrt{2} \).

Now, expanding RHS:

1. \(\|x + y + \sqrt{2} z\|^2 = \|x\|^2 + \|y\|^2 + 2\|\sqrt{2} z\|^2 + 2\langle x, y \rangle + 2\langle x, \sqrt{2} z \rangle + 2\langle y, \sqrt{2} z \rangle \)
Wait, no, \( \|x + y + \sqrt{2} z\|^2 = \|x + y\|^2 + \|\sqrt{2} z\|^2 + 2\langle x + y, \sqrt{2} z \rangle \)
But that's if you separate \( x + y \) and \( \sqrt{2} z \). Let's actually expand properly:

Original expansion: \( \|a + b + c\|^2 = \|a\|^2 + \|b\|^2 + \|c\|^2 + 2\langle a, b \rangle + 2\langle a, c \rangle + 2\langle b, c \rangle \).

So, \( \|x + y + \sqrt{2} z\|^2 = \|x\|^2 + \|y\|^2 + 2\|z\|^2 + 2\langle x, y \rangle + 2\langle x, \sqrt{2} z \rangle + 2\langle y, \sqrt{2} z \rangle \)

Similarly:

2. \( \|x + \pi z\|^2 = \|x\|^2 + \pi^2\|z\|^2 + 2\pi \langle x, z \rangle \)
3. \( \|y + \pi z\|^2 = \|y\|^2 + \pi^2\|z\|^2 + 2\pi \langle y, z \rangle \)
4. \( \|\sqrt{2} z\|^2 = 2 \|z\|^2 \)

Adding these together:
Total RHS = \( \|x\|^2 + \|y\|^2 + 2\|z\|^2 + 2\langle x, y \rangle + 2\sqrt{2}\langle x, z \rangle + 2\sqrt{2}\langle y, z \rangle + \|x\|^2 + \pi^2\|z\|^2 + 2\pi \langle x, z \rangle + \|y\|^2 + \pi^2\|z\|^2 + 2\pi \langle y, z \rangle + 2\|z\|^2 \)

Combine like terms:
RHS = \( 2\|x\|^2 + 2\|y\|^2 + (2 + \pi^2 + \pi^2 + 2)\|z\|^2 + 2\langle x, y \rangle + 2\sqrt{2}\langle x, z \rangle + 2\sqrt{2}\langle y, z \rangle + 2\pi \langle x, z \rangle + 2\pi \langle y, z \rangle \)

Simplify the coefficients:
For \( \|z\|^2 \): \( 2\pi^2 + 4 \)
For the inner product terms: Coefficients of \( \langle x, y \rangle \) is 2; coefficients for \( \langle x, z \rangle \) and \( \langle y, z \rangle \) are \( 2\sqrt{2} + 2\pi \)

Comparing LHS and RHS, their terms for \( \|x\|^2, \|y\|^2, \|z\|^2 \), and \( \langle x, y \rangle \) are the same. Similarly, the coefficients for \( \langle x, z \rangle \) and \( \langle y, z \rangle \) are also the same (both sides have \( 2\pi + 2\sqrt{2} \) and \( 2\sqrt{2} + 2\pi \) which are the same). Wait, hang on, in LHS we had:

- For coefficients of \( \langle x, z \rangle \): \( 2\pi + 2\sqrt{2} \)
- For coefficients of \( \langle y, z \rangle \): same

In RHS, the coefficients are:

- \( 2\sqrt{2} + 2\pi \)

Same as above. So all terms actually cancel out, giving zero. Therefore, quadratic functions of the form \( f(u) = \|u\|^2 \) would also satisfy the equation. Interesting. So quadratic functions may be solutions as well. Wait, but quadratic is not linear or affine. Maybe the equation is satisfied by both linear and quadratic functions. Or perhaps more generally?

But let's confirm with another example. Suppose \( f(u) = \|u\|^2 + \langle a, u \rangle + b \). Let me check the equation in this case.

But then, if LHS and RHS differ by the linear parts, but we saw both linear and quadratic parts satisfy the equation separately. Therefore, their combination should also satisfy the equation. Hence, \( f(u) = c\|u\|^2 + \langle a, u \rangle + b \), with constants \( c \in \mathbb{R} \), \( a \in H \), \( b \in \mathbb{R} \). Wait, but I need to check if c affects the equality.

Let me suppose \( f(u) = c\|u\|^2 \), then as above, both LHS and RHS will have the same terms, so the difference would be zero. Therefore, quadratic functions with coefficient \( c \) also satisfy the equation.

So maybe all functions of the form \( f(u) = c\|u\|^2 + \langle a, u \rangle + b \)? Let's check.

Since linear functions and quadratic functions each satisfy the equation on their own, the sum would also satisfy because the equation is linear in \( f \). Yes, because if I denote the operator T[f] = LHS - RHS, then T is linear, so T[linear + quadratic] = T[linear] + T[quadratic] = 0 + 0 = 0.

Therefore, any function \( f \) which is a quadratic form plus a linear term plus a constant satisfies the equation.

But the problem states "Find all continuous functions f: H â†’ R". In Hilbert spaces, continuous functions that are solutions to such functional equations often turn out to be quadratic forms. But in this case, linear functions and constants also work. Wait, but in the equation as given, constants actually would disappear. Let me check if constants work.

Suppose \( f(u) = b \), a constant function. Then LHS would be 4b and RHS would also be 4b, so constant functions satisfy the equation. But similarly, when you have linear functions, adding a constant they still satisfy the equation because constants cancel out.

Wait, linear function with a constant term would behave as follows: when you compute LHS - RHS, the constants would sum to 4b on LHS and 4b on RHS, so constants cancel. So the result is still zero, as before. So, indeed, constants are allowed.

Therefore, functions of the form \( f(u) = c\|u\|^2 + \langle a, u \rangle + b \) where \( c \) is a scalar, \( a \in H \), and \( b \in \mathbb{R} \) all satisfy the equation.

But the problem is over a real Hilbert space, and the question is to find all continuous functions satisfying that equation. Now, by continuity, we know in Hilbert spaces that polynomial functions of degree at most 2 (i.e., quadratic forms) with continuity are precisely the functions expressible as \( c\|u\|^2 + \langle a, u \rangle + b \). Therefore, perhaps these are all the solutions.

But wait, let me check if higher-degree polynomials could also satisfy the equation. But if we have, for example, a cubic function, I doubt that the functional equation would hold. Let me see.

Suppose \( f(u) = \|u\|^3 \). Then LHS would involve terms like \( \|x + y + \pi z\|^3 \), etc. Summing would lead to terms that probably don't cancel out. But since the equation mixes different coefficients (pi and sqrt(2}), unless the function is quadratic or lower, the powers would not cancel.

But maybe there is a non-polynomial function that satisfies the equation. However, given that quadratic and linear functions do, and the equation is linear in f, maybe the general solution is quadratic. Given the problem states f is continuous, so in the context of Hilbert spaces, continuous solutions to quadratic functional equations are quadratic forms. So the standard result is that quadratic forms (plus linear and constants) are the solutions. Thus, we can conjecture that all continuous solutions are quadratic polynomials, i.e., functions of the form \( f(u) = c\|u\|^2 + \langle a, u \rangle + b \).

But we must ensure there are no other solutions. Let me see if the functional equation can be rewritten in a way that suggests some kind of linearity or bilinearity. Maybe consider the difference of the two sides is zero, then:

\( f(x + y + \pi z) + f(x + \sqrt{2} z) + f(y + \sqrt{2} z) + f(\pi z) - f(x + y + \sqrt{2} z) - f(x + \pi z) - f(y + \pi z) - f(\sqrt{2} z) = 0 \)

Maybe rearranging terms:

\( [f(x + y + \pi z) - f(x + y + \sqrt{2} z)] + [f(x + \sqrt{2} z) - f(x + \pi z)] + [f(y + \sqrt{2} z) - f(y + \pi z)] + [f(\pi z) - f(\sqrt{2} z)] = 0 \)

This seems like a combination of differences where in each bracket, the difference is between the argument with pi z and sqrt(2) z. Perhaps this suggests some relations between the function's behavior under scaling by pi vs sqrt(2). Let me denote some variables substitutions.

Let me try substituting specific values.

First, set x = y = 0. Then the equation becomes:

LHS: f(0 + 0 + pi z) + f(0 + sqrt(2) z) + f(0 + sqrt(2) z) + f(pi z)

RHS: f(0 + 0 + sqrt(2) z) + f(0 + pi z) + f(0 + pi z) + f(sqrt(2) z)

Simplify:

LHS: 2f(pi z) + 2f(sqrt(2) z)
RHS: 2f(pi z) + 2f(sqrt(2) z)

So the equation reduces to 0 = 0, which tells us nothing new. So we need a better substitution.

Perhaps, take z = 0. Then the equation becomes:

LHS: f(x + y + 0) + f(x + 0) + f(y + 0) + f(0) = f(x + y) + f(x) + f(y) + f(0)
RHS: f(x + y + 0) + f(x + 0) + f(y + 0) + f(0) = same as LHS
Thus, z = 0 doesn't give us any information.

Alternatively, set x = y. Hmm. Suppose x = y. Then LHS:

f(2x + pi z) + f(x + sqrt(2) z) + f(x + sqrt(2) z) + f(pi z) = f(2x + pi z) + 2f(x + sqrt{2} z) + f(pi z)

RHS:

f(2x + sqrt{2} z) + f(x + pi z) + f(x + pi z) + f(sqrt{2} z) = f(2x + sqrt{2} z) + 2f(x + pi z) + f(sqrt{2} z)

So equation becomes:

f(2x + pi z) + 2f(x + sqrt{2} z) + f(pi z) = f(2x + sqrt{2} z) + 2f(x + pi z) + f(sqrt{2} z)

Not sure. Maybe set x = 0. Let's set x = 0:

LHS: f(0 + y + pi z) + f(0 + sqrt(2} z) + f(y + sqrt(2} z) + f(pi z)
RHS: f(0 + y + sqrt(2} z) + f(0 + pi z) + f(y + pi z) + f(sqrt{2} z)

Simplify:

LHS: f(y + pi z) + f(sqrt(2} z) + f(y + sqrt{2} z) + f(pi z)
RHS: f(y + sqrt(2} z) + f(pi z) + f(y + pi z) + f(sqrt{2} z)

Rearranged, LHS = RHS. No new information. So setting x = 0 also gives an identity.

Similarly, if we set y = 0, it will also lead to identity. Therefore, setting any one of x, y, z to zero seems not helpful.

Perhaps another approach. Let me denote u = x + y. Let me see if I can rewrite the equation as:

f(u + pi z) + f(x + sqrt(2} z) + f(y + sqrt(2} z) + f(pi z) = f(u + sqrt(2} z) + f(x + pi z) + f(y + pi z) + f(sqrt(2} z)

But u = x + y, so it's similar but not so helpful. Alternatively, let's see if the equation implies some kind of additive or multiplicative behavior. Let me consider the difference f(u + a v) - f(u + b v) for constants a and b. In the equation, pi and sqrt(2) appear as coefficients. These numbers are both transcendental and linearly independent over rationals, which might mean that they don't interact in some way. That might be important.

Suppose we fix z and consider f as a function evaluated at different linear combinations of x, y, z. But it's complicated. Instead, perhaps defining a new function g(w) = f(w) - c\|w\|^2 - \langle a, w \rangle - b. Then, if f has that form, g would be identically zero. But the equation is linear in f, so maybe g satisfies the same functional equation. Therefore, if we can show that the only continuous solution is g = 0, then f must be as above. But I need to see if the functional equation enforces g to be zero.

Wait, if we suppose that f is of the form quadratic + linear + constant, then g = 0. Are there any other solutions?

Alternatively, let me test if the equation implies that f is a quadratic function. Considering that quadratic functions satisfy the equation, and since the equation seems to relate different scalings of the variable, maybe the equation enforces quadratic behavior.

Alternatively, let me see if the equation is similar to the equation defining quadratic functions. For example, the parallelogram law in Hilbert spaces is related to quadratic forms. But this equation looks more complicated. Maybe by taking derivatives, if f is differentiable, then we can compute the derivatives. But continuity is given, not necessarily differentiability.

Alternatively, consider if f is a linear function, quadratic function, or affine function, then it's solution. But maybe I can try a general approach.

Assume that f is twice differentiable (though the problem only states continuous). If f is twice differentiable, then we can take derivatives with respect to z. Let's fix x and y, and let z vary. Then, differentiate both sides with respect to z. But since we are in a Hilbert space, maybe taking directional derivatives.

Define the directional derivative of f at a point u in direction h as \( D_h f(u) = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(u + th) - f(u)}{t} \).

Assuming f is differentiable, we can compute the derivative of both sides with respect to z in some direction h. Since the equation must hold for all z, we can take derivatives.

Let me first compute the derivative of the left-hand side (LHS):

D_h [f(x + y + \pi z) + f(x + \sqrt{2} z) + f(y + \sqrt{2} z) + f(\pi z)]

For each term:

1. D_h f(x + y + \pi z) = \pi D_{\pi h} f(x + y + \pi z) = \pi D_h f(x + y + \pi z) since the derivative is linear.
Wait, more precisely, if you have f(u) where u = x + y + \pi z, then the derivative in direction h is f'(u)(\pi h) = \pi f'(u)(h). Similarly for others.

Alternatively, since z is the variable, then the derivative of f(x + y + \pi z) with respect to z in direction h is f'(x + y + \pi z)(\pi h) = \pi D_h f(x + y + \pi z). Similarly, derivative of f(x + sqrt(2) z) in direction h is sqrt(2) D_h f(x + sqrt(2) z). Similarly for the others.

So total derivative of LHS:

\pi D_h f(x + y + \pi z) + \sqrt{2} D_h f(x + \sqrt{2} z) + \sqrt{2} D_h f(y + \sqrt{2} z) + \pi D_h f(\pi z)

Similarly, derivative of RHS:

D_h [f(x + y + \sqrt{2} z) + f(x + \pi z) + f(y + \pi z) + f(\sqrt{2} z)]

Calculating each term:

\sqrt{2} D_h f(x + y + \sqrt{2} z) + \pi D_h f(x + \pi z) + \pi D_h f(y + \pi z) + \sqrt{2} D_h f(\sqrt{2} z)

Thus, after differentiating both sides, we get:

\[ \pi D_h f(x + y + \pi z) + \sqrt{2} D_h f(x + \sqrt{2} z) + \sqrt{2} D_h f(y + \sqrt{2} z) + \pi D_h f(\pi z) \]
\[ = \sqrt{2} D_h f(x + y + \sqrt{2} z) + \pi D_h f(x + \pi z) + \pi D_h f(y + \pi z) + \sqrt{2} D_h f(\sqrt{2} z) \]

If we assume that f is linear, then its derivative is constant, so all directional derivatives are constant (i.e., D_h f(u) = \langle a, h \rangle ). Plugging that in:

LHS derivatives would yield:

\pi \langle a, h \rangle + \sqrt{2} \langle a, h \rangle + \sqrt{2} \langle a, h \rangle + \pi \langle a, h \rangle = (2\pi + 2\sqrt{2}) \langle a, h \rangle

RHS derivatives would yield:

\sqrt{2} \langle a, h \rangle + \pi \langle a, h \rangle + \pi \langle a, h \rangle + \sqrt{2} \langle a, h \rangle = (2\pi + 2\sqrt{2}) \langle a, h \rangle

Similarly, for linear functions, the derivative equation is satisfied.

If f is quadratic, then its derivative is linear, so D_h f(u) = 2c \langle u, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle.

Let me compute this for quadratic functions. Suppose \( f(u) = c \|u\|^2 + \langle a, u \rangle + b \). Then D_h f(u) = 2c \langle u, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle.

Plugging into the derivative equation:

Left-hand side:

\pi [2c \langle x + y + \pi z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ] + sqrt(2) [2c \langle x + sqrt(2) z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ] + sqrt(2) [2c \langle y + sqrt(2) z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ] + pi [2c \langle pi z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ]

Simplify:

2c pi \langle x + y + pi z, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle + 2c sqrt(2) \langle x + sqrt(2) z, h \rangle + sqrt(2) \langle a, h \rangle + 2c sqrt(2) \langle y + sqrt(2) z, h \rangle + sqrt(2) \langle a, h \rangle + 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle

Combine like terms:

Terms with \langle x, h \rangle: 2c pi \langle x, h \rangle + 2c sqrt(2) \langle x, h \rangle

Terms with \langle y, h \rangle: 2c pi \langle y, h \rangle + 2c sqrt(2) \langle y, h \rangle

Terms with \langle z, h \rangle: 2c pi \cdot pi \langle z, h \rangle + 2c sqrt(2) \cdot sqrt(2) \langle z, h \rangle + 2c sqrt(2) \cdot sqrt(2) \langle z, h \rangle

Constants: pi \langle a, h \rangle + sqrt(2) \langle a, h \rangle + sqrt(2) \langle a, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle

Calculating coefficients:

For \langle x, h \rangle: 2c (pi + sqrt(2)) 

Similarly for \langle y, h \rangle: same.

For \langle z, h \rangle: 2c pi^2 + 2c * 2 + 2c * 2 = 2c (pi^2 + 4 )

Constants: (pi + pi) \langle a, h \rangle + (sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)) \langle a, h \rangle = 2 pi \langle a, h \rangle + 2 sqrt(2) \langle a, h \rangle = 2(pi + sqrt(2)) \langle a, h \rangle.

Now, the right-hand side derivative:

sqrt(2) [2c \langle x + y + sqrt(2) z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ] + pi [2c \langle x + pi z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ] + pi [2c \langle y + pi z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ] + sqrt(2) [2c \langle sqrt(2) z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ]

Simplify each term:

sqrt(2) [2c \langle x + y, h \rangle + 2c sqrt(2) \langle z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ]

+ pi [2c \langle x, h \rangle + 2c pi \langle z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ]

+ pi [2c \langle y, h \rangle + 2c pi \langle z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ]

+ sqrt(2) [2c sqrt(2) \langle z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ]

Breaking down:

Coefficients of \langle x, h \rangle: 2c sqrt(2) \langle x, h \rangle + 2c pi \langle x, h \rangle

Coefficients of \langle y, h \rangle: 2c sqrt(2) \langle y, h \rangle + 2c pi \langle y, h \rangle

Coefficients of \langle z, h \rangle: 2c (sqrt(2))^2 \langle z, h \rangle sqrt{2} + 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle pi + 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle pi + 2c (sqrt{2})^2 \langle z, h \rangle sqrt(2)

Wait, step by step:

First term in RHS:

sqrt(2) ... coefficients for z: 2c sqrt(2) sqrt(2) = 2c * 2 * \langle z, h \rangle

Similarly, second term: pi * 2c pi \langle z, h \rangle (from x + pi z)

Third term: pi * 2c pi \langle z, h \rangle

Fourth term: sqrt(2) * 2c sqrt(2) \langle z, h \rangle

So coefficients for z:

2c * 2 + 2c pi^2 + 2c pi^2 + 2c * 2 
= 4c + 2 pi^2 c + 2 pi^2 c + 4c 
= 8c + 4 pi^2 c ???

Wait, no. Let me do this carefully.

From first term: sqrt(2) applied to the term 2c sqrt(2) z \cdot h: coefficient is sqrt(2)*2c sqrt(2) \langle z, h \rangle = 2c*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = 2c*2 \langle z, h \rangle = 4c \langle z, h \rangle.

Second term: pi applied to 2c pi \langle z, h \rangle: pi*2c pi \langle z, h \rangle = 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle.

Third term: same as second but for y: 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle.

Fourth term: sqrt(2)*2c sqrt(2) \langle z, h \rangle = same as first term: 4c \langle z, h \rangle.

So total coefficient for z:

4c + 2c pi^2 + 2c pi^2 + 4c = 8c + 4 pi^2 c

Wait, no. Wait, the 2c is multiplied?

Wait, error:

Original expression for RHS after expansion.

Wait, the derivatives:

First term on RHS: sqrt(2) [2c \langle x + y + sqrt(2) z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ]

Expand 2c \langle x + y + sqrt(2) z, h \rangle = 2c \langle x, h \rangle + 2c \langle y, h \rangle + 2c sqrt(2) \langle z, h \rangle

Multiply by sqrt(2):

2c sqrt(2) \langle x, h \rangle + 2c sqrt(2) \langle y, h \rangle + 2c * 2 \langle z, h \rangle 

Second term: pi [2c \langle x + pi z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ]: similarly:

pi [2c \langle x, h \rangle + 2c pi \langle z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ] = 2c pi \langle x, h \rangle + 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle

Third term: same as second term but for y: 2c pi \langle y, h \rangle + 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle

Fourth term: sqrt(2) [2c \langle sqrt(2) z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ] = sqrt(2)*2c sqrt(2) \langle z, h \rangle + sqrt(2) \langle a, h \rangle = 4c \langle z, h \rangle + sqrt(2) \langle a, h \rangle

Now, combine terms:

For \langle x, h \rangle: 2c sqrt(2) \langle x, h \rangle + 2c pi \langle x, h \rangle

Similarly, \langle y, h \rangle: 2c sqrt(2) \langle y, h \rangle + 2c pi \langle y, h \rangle

For \langle z, h \rangle: 4c \langle z, h \rangle + 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle + 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle + 4c \langle z, h \rangle 

= (4c + 4c) \langle z, h \rangle + (2c pi^2 + 2c pi^2 ) \langle z, h \rangle

= 8c \langle z, h \rangle + 4c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle 

Constants terms from directional derivative of a:

sqrt(2) \langle a, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle + sqrt(2) \langle a, h \rangle 

= 2 sqrt(2) \langle a, h \rangle + 2 pi \langle a, h \rangle

Similarly, compare with LHS:

For \langle x, h \rangle: 2c (pi + sqrt(2)) on LHS, and 2c (pi + sqrt(2)) on RHS

For \langle y, h \rangle: same as x.

For \langle z, h \rangle:

LHS was: 2c (pi^2 + 4 )

RHS is: 8c + 4pi^2 c. Wait, that's the same as 4c (2) + 4c pi^2 = 4c (pi^2 + 2), whereas LHS was 2c (pi^2 + 4 ). That are conflicting unless:

Wait:

Wait, in LHS,

z-coefficients: total was 2c pi^2 + 2c * 2 + 2c * 2 + pi's from ...Let me check my original calculation on LHS:

Original LHS:

Terms with \langle z, h \rangle:

From first term (x + y + pi z): pi * 2c pi \langle z, h \rangle 

From x + sqrt(2) z: sqrt(2) * 2c sqrt(2) \langle z, h \rangle

From y + sqrt(2) z: sqrt(2) * 2c sqrt(2) \langle z, h \rangle

From pi z: pi * 2c pi \langle z, h \rangle

Therefore:

pi * 2c pi + sqrt(2) * 2c sqrt(2) * 2 (since x and y terms both contribute that) + pi * 2c pi ? Wait, no.

Wait, original LHS was:

[For term f(x + y + pi z): when taking derivative, gives 2c \pi \langle x + y + \pi z, h \rangle. Wait, no, I was a bit confused.

Wait, original LHS after substitution of quadratic function is:

Left-hand side derivatives after expansion had coefficient for z:

From each term:

1. f(x + y + pi z): inner product term was 2c pi \langle z, h \rangle (from the pi in the argument as the function is quadratic)
2. f(x + sqrt{2} z): inner product term 2c sqrt{2} \langle z, h \rangle
3. f(y + sqrt{2} z): another 2c sqrt{2} \langle z, h \rangle
4. f(pi z): inner product term 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle

So total coefficients for \langle z, h \rangle on LHS:

2c pi \langle z, h \rangle (x+y+pi z gives pi * z component but actually, no. Wait, hold on. Earlier calculation in LHS z-term coefficients was:

Wait, no, actually, the expansion was:

LHS deriv. coefficients for z:

From x + y + pi z: pi^2 * z term, but no. Wait no:

Wait, when we differentiated f(x + y + pi z), the inner product with h was via the derivative. For f(x + y + pi z), which as a function has u = x + y + pi z. Then the derivative in direction h is 2c \langle u, pi h \rangle + \langle a, pi h \rangle = 2c pi \langle u, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle. Wait, this seems off.

No, actually, if f(u) = c \|u\|^2 + \langle a, u \rangle + b, then D_h f(u) = 2c \langle u, h \rangle + \langle a, h \\rangle.

But when u is x + y + pi z, then the derivative component resulting from varying z is:

The differential with respect to z is in direction pi h, which will result in D_{pi h} f(u) = 2c \langle u, pi h \rangle + \langle a, pi h \rangle = 2c pi \langle u, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle.

But in our case, the derivative in direction h of f(x + y + pi z) with respect to z is the same as D_{pi h} f(x + y + pi z). Therefore:

D_h [f(x + y + pi z)] = D f(x + y + pi z)(pi h) = 2c \langle x + y + pi z, pi h \rangle + \langle a, pi h \rangle = 2c pi \langle x + y + pi z, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle.

Similarly, D_h f(x + sqrt(2} z) = D sqrt(2) h f(x + sqrt(2} z) = 2c sqrt(2) \langle x + sqrt(2} z, h \rangle + sqrt(2) \langle a, h \rangle.

So when we compose all the derivatives:

LHS derivative is:

2c pi \langle x + y + pi z, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle

+ 2c sqrt(2) \langle x + sqrt(2} z, h \rangle + sqrt(2} \langle a, h \rangle

+ 2c sqrt(2} \langle y + sqrt(2} z, h \rangle + sqrt(2} \langle a, h \rangle

+ 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle

Therefore, summing up the coefficients for \langle z, h \rangle:

From first term: 2c pi * pi âŸ¨z, hâŸ© = 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle

Wait, no:

Wait, expand \langle x + y + pi z, h \rangle = \langle x, h \rangle + \langle y, h \rangle + pi \langle z, h \rangle

So first term contributes 2c pi (\langle x + y + pi z, h \rangle) = 2c pi \langle x, h \rangle + 2c pi \langle y, h \rangle + 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle

Similarly, second term: 2c sqrt(2} \langle x + sqrt(2} z, h \rangle = 2c sqrt(2) \langle x, h \rangle + 2c sqrt(2) * sqrt(2} \langle z, h \rangle = 2c sqrt(2) \langle x, h \rangle + 4c \langle z, h \rangle

Third term: Similarly, 2c sqrt{2} \langle y, h \rangle + 4c \langle z, h \rangle

Fourth term: 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle

So combining the \langle z, h \rangle terms:

2c pi^2 (from first term) + 4c (from second term) + 4c (from third term) + 2c pi^2 (from fourth term) = 4c pi^2 + 8c

While the \langle x, h \rangle terms: 2c pi from first term + 2c sqrt(2)} from second term

Similarly, \langle y, h \rangle: 2c pi from first term + 2c sqrt(2)} from third term.

Constants from a:

pi \langle a, h \rangle + sqrt(2} \langle a, h \rangle + sqrt(2} \langle a, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle = 2(pi + sqrt(2}) \langle a, h \rangle

Comparing to RHS deriv. coefficients:

RHS derivatives:

From first term:

First term: sqrt(2} * [2c \langle x + y + sqrt(2} z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ]

Expanding, similar steps:

2c sqrt(2} \langle x, h \rangle + 2c sqrt(2} \langle y, h \rangle + 2c * 2 \langle z, h \rangle + sqrt(2} \langle a, h \rangle

Second and third terms: pi * [2c \langle x + pi z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ] and similarly for y:

This gives:

2c pi \langle x, h \rangle + 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle

Similarly for y: 2c pi \langle y, h \rangle + 2c pi^2 \langle z, h \rangle + pi \langle a, h \rangle

Fourth term: sqrt(2} * [2c \langle sqrt(2} z, h \rangle + \langle a, h \rangle ]: 

2c sqrt(2)} * sqrt(2} \langle z, h \rangle + sqrt(2} \langle a, h \rangle = 4c \langle z, h \rangle + sqrt(2} \langle a, h \rangle

Combining \langle z, h \rangle terms on RHS:

From first term: 4c

From second term: 2c pi^2

From third term: 2c pi^2

From fourth term: 4c

Total: 4c pi^2 + 8c

Same as LHS, so for quadratic functions, they do satisfy the derivative equation.

Ah, so even though when we compute coefficients of \langle z, h \rangle on LHS and RHS, they both resulted in 4c(pi^2 + 2).

Thus, both sides match.

Therefore, quadratic functions pass the derivative test. What about functions beyond quadratic? Let's suppose a cubic function.

Take f(u) = \|u\|^3. Compute at some specific vectors. Let H = R for simplicity (though the problem says H is any real Hilbert space, but we can check in 1D).

Let H = R. Let x, y, z be scalars.

Compute LHS and RHS for H = R. Let's set x = y = z = 1.

LHS: f(1 + 1 + Ï€ * 1) + f(1 + âˆš2 *  1}) + f(1 + âˆš2 *  1}) + f(Ï€ * 1)
= f(2 + Ï€) + 2 f(1 + âˆš2) + f(Ï€)

RHS: f(1 + 1 + âˆš2 * 1}) + f(1 + Ï€ * 1}) + f(1 + Ï€ * 1}) + f(âˆš2 * 1)
= f(2 + âˆš2) + 2 f(1 + Ï€) + f(âˆš2)

If f(u) = u^3:

LHS: (2 + Ï€)^3 + 2*(1 + âˆš2)^3 + Ï€^3
RHS: (2 + âˆš2)^3 + 2*(1 + Ï€)^3 + (âˆš2)^3

Compute numerically:

Calculate each term:

2 + Ï€ â‰ˆ 5.1416, cube â‰ˆ 135.93

1 + âˆš2 â‰ˆ 2.4142, cube â‰ˆ 14.07, multiplied by 2 â‰ˆ 28.14

Ï€â‰ˆ3.1416, cubeâ‰ˆ31.006

Total LHSâ‰ˆ135.93 +28.14+31.006â‰ˆ195.076

RHS:

2 + âˆš2 â‰ˆ 3.4142, cubeâ‰ˆ39.66

1 + Ï€â‰ˆ4.1416, cubeâ‰ˆ 71.04, multiplied by 2â‰ˆ142.08

(âˆš2)^3â‰ˆ2.8284

Total RHSâ‰ˆ39.66 +142.08 +2.828â‰ˆ184.57

So LHSâ‰ˆ195.08 â‰ˆ RHSâ‰ˆ184.57 are not equal. Thus, cubic function does not satisfy the equation. Hence, only quadratic, linear, and constant functions are solutions.

Moreover, because pi and sqrt(2) are incommensurate (transcendental and irrational), it's unlikely that other functional forms would satisfy the equation. Therefore, after considering derivatives and testing specific cases, quadratic forms (including linear and constants) are the only solutions. Given the problem asks for continuous functions, which in Hilbert space setting, polynomials beyond degree 2 would not be bounded unless they are of lower degree. But here even in limited testing, higher degrees fail.

Hence, the final answer is that all continuous solutions are quadratic functions of the form \( f(u) = c \|u\|^2 + \langle a, u \rangle + b \), where \( c \in \mathbb{R} \), \( a \in H \), and \( b \in \mathbb{R} \).

To confirm, in the original equation, when substituting such f, we already saw in the beginning that linear parts satisfy it and quadratic parts satisfy it, and constants cancel out. Hence, their combination also satisfies the equation. Continuity is automatically satisfied by such polynomials in Hilbert spaces. Hence, all solutions are quadratic polynomials.

I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
All continuous solutions are quadratic polynomials, and thus the functions are of the form \boxed{f(x) = a\|x\|^2 + \langle b, x \rangle + c} where \( a, c \in \mathbb{R} \) and \( b \in H \).

<text>Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find all continuous functions \( f: H \to \mathbb{R} \) where \( H \) is a real Hilbert space, and the given functional equation holds for any \( x, y, z \in H \).</text>
<explanation>The solver begins by clearly stating their approach to tackle the problem systematically ("step by step") and restating the problem to ensure they understand what they're looking for. This demonstrates strategic planning by establishing the goal and constraints before diving into solution methods.</explanation>

<start>148</start>
<end>370</end>
<text>Hmm. First, functional equations often require substituting specific values for variables to simplify them. Since the equation must hold for all \( x, y, z \in H \), maybe choosing some particular \( x \), \( y \), or \( z \) can help reduce the equation and reveal the form of \( f \).</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies a common strategy for functional equations (substituting specific values) and explains how this approach might help simplify the problem. This shows strategic planning by considering potential solution methods based on the problem type.</explanation>

<start>370</start>
<end>485</end>
<text>Let me first check if linear functions satisfy this. Suppose \( f(u) = \langle a, u \rangle + b \), where \( a \in H \) is a fixed vector and \( b \in \mathbb{R} \).</text>
<explanation>The solver decides to start with the simplest possible solution (linear functions) as a strategic first step, showing a methodical approach to the problem rather than attempting more complex solutions immediately.</explanation>

<start>485</start>
<end>1145</end>
<text>Let's plug this into the equation and see if both sides are equal.

Left-hand side (LHS):
\[ \langle a, x + y + \pi z \rangle + b + \langle a, x + \sqrt{2} z \rangle + b + \langle a, y + \sqrt{2} z \rangle + b + \langle a, \pi z \rangle + b \]
Simplifying:
\[ \langle a, x + y + \pi z + x + \sqrt{2} z + y + \sqrt{2} z + \pi z \rangle + 4b \]
Combine like terms:
\[ \langle a, 2x + 2y + (\pi + \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} + \pi) z \rangle + 4b \]
Which simplifies to:
\[ \langle a, 2x + 2y + (2\pi + 2\sqrt{2}) z \rangle + 4b \]</text>
<explanation>The solver tests their hypothesis that linear functions might satisfy the equation by substituting a general linear function into the left side of the equation and carefully working through the algebraic simplification to see what results.</explanation>

<start>1145</start>
<end>1747</end>
<text>Right-hand side (RHS):
\[ \langle a, x + y + \sqrt{2} z \rangle + b + \langle a, x + \pi z \rangle + b + \langle a, y + \pi z \rangle + b + \langle a, \sqrt{2} z \rangle + b \]
Simplifying:
\[ \langle a, x + y + \sqrt{2} z + x + \pi z + y + \pi z + \sqrt{2} z \rangle + 4b \]
Combine like terms:
\[ \langle a, 2x + 2y + (\sqrt{2} + \pi + \pi + \sqrt{2}) z \rangle + 4b \]
Simplifies to:
\[ \langle a, 2x + 2y + (2\pi + 2\sqrt{2}) z \rangle + 4b \]

So both sides are equal! That means linear functions of the form \( f(u) = \langle a, u \rangle + b \) satisfy the equation. Hmm, this suggests linear functions are solutions. Maybe affine functions in general, since adding a constant also works here.</text>
<explanation>The solver continues testing their hypothesis by calculating the right side of the equation and comparing it with the left side. Upon finding that they're equal, they confirm that linear functions satisfy the equation and consider the broader class of affine functions.</explanation>

<start>1747</start>

<explanation>After confirming that linear functions work, the solver forms a new hypothesis about quadratic functions potentially being solutions, showing systematic hypothesis testing by proceeding to the next level of complexity.</explanation>

<start>1955</start>
<end>2091</end>
<text>Suppose \( f(u) = \langle u, u \rangle \), the squared norm. Let's compute LHS and RHS.

LHS:
\[ \|x + y + \pi z\|^2 + \|x + \sqrt{2} z\|^2 + \|y + \sqrt{2} z\|^2 + \|\pi z\|^2 \]

RHS:
\[ \|x + y + \sqrt{2} z\|^2 + \|x + \pi z\|^2 + \|y + \pi z\|^2 + \|\sqrt{2} z\|^2 \]</text>
<explanation>The solver tests a specific quadratic function (the squared norm) by substituting it into both sides of the equation, showing a systematic approach to hypothesis testing.</explanation>

<start>7583</start>
<end>7894</end>
<text>Therefore, functions of the form \( f(u) = c\|u\|^2 + \langle a, u \rangle + b \) where \( c \) is a scalar, \( a \in H \), and \( b \in \mathbb{R} \) all satisfy the equation.

But the problem is over a real Hilbert space, and the question is to find all continuous functions satisfying that equation. Now, by continuity, we know in Hilbert spaces that polynomial functions of degree at most 2 (i.e., quadratic forms) with continuity are precisely the functions expressible as \( c\|u\|^2 + \langle a, u \rangle + b \).</text>
<explanation>After testing both linear and quadratic functions, the solver combines these findings to form a more general hypothesis about the form of all solutions, demonstrating the iterative nature of hypothesis testing in mathematics.</explanation>

<start>14462</start>
<end>15014</end>
<text>Let H = R. Let x, y, z be scalars.

LHS: f(1 + 1 + Ï€ * 1) + f(1 + âˆš2 *  1}) + f(1 + âˆš2 *  1}) + f(Ï€ * 1)
= f(2 + Ï€) + 2 f(1 + âˆš2) + f(Ï€)

RHS: f(1 + 1 + âˆš2 * 1}) + f(1 + Ï€ * 1}) + f(1 + Ï€ * 1}) + f(âˆš2 * 1)
= f(2 + âˆš2) + 2 f(1 + Ï€) + f(âˆš2)

If f(u) = u^3:

LHS: (2 + Ï€)^3 + 2*(1 + âˆš2)^3 + Ï€^3
RHS: (2 + âˆš2)^3 + 2*(1 + Ï€)^3 + (âˆš2)^3</text>

<start>6913</start>
<end>7136</end>
<text>Since linear functions and quadratic functions each satisfy the equation on their own, the sum would also satisfy because the equation is linear in \( f \). Yes, because if I denote the operator T[f] = LHS - RHS, then T is linear, so T[linear + quadratic] = T[linear] + T[quadratic] = 0 + 0 = 0.</text>

Suppose \( f(u) = b \), a constant function. Then LHS would be 4b and RHS would also be 4b, so constant functions satisfy the equation.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies that constant functions satisfy the functional equation by direct substitution, demonstrating mathematical verification of a specific case.</explanation>

<start>7583</start>
<end>8009</end>
<text>But similarly, when you have linear functions, adding a constant they still satisfy the equation because constants cancel out.

Wait, linear function with a constant term would behave as follows: when you compute LHS - RHS, the constants would sum to 4b on LHS and 4b on RHS, so constants cancel. So the result is still zero, as before. So, indeed, constants are allowed.

Therefore, functions of the form \( f(u) = c\|u\|^2 + \langle a, u \rangle + b \) where \( c \) is a scalar, \( a \in H \), and \( b \in \mathbb{R} \) all satisfy the equation.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies that adding constants to linear functions still yields valid solutions, and then generalizes this to verify that the combination of quadratic, linear, and constant terms satisfies the equation.</explanation>
