Answer Choices:
(A) ln(2) [ℏ^2/2mα]
(B) ln(4) [ℏ^2/2mα]
(C) ln(2) [ℏ^2/mα^2]
(D) ln(4) [ℏ^2/mα^2]

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to find the value of x0 such that the probability of finding the particle with |x| < x0 is exactly 1/2. The particle is in a 1D potential given by V(x) = -α δ(x), and it's bound. I remember that the delta potential has a single bound state, so there's only one wavefunction for this particle.

First, I should recall the form of the wavefunction for the bound state in a delta potential. The bound state wavefunction for the delta potential is symmetric around the origin, right? So it should be an even function. I think the wavefunction is something like ψ(x) = sqrt(κ) e^{-κ|x|}, where κ is related to the energy of the state.

The energy of the bound state is given by E = - (m α2)/(2 ħ2). Let me check this formula. The bound state energy for a delta potential is usually E = -m α2/(2 ħ2), where α is the strength of the potential. Yeah, that seems right. Then κ would be related to the energy as κ = sqrt(-2mE)/ħ. Plugging E into that, κ = sqrt(-2m(-m α2/(2 ħ2)))/ħ = sqrt(m2 α2/(ħ2)))/ħ? Wait, that sounds confusing. Let me compute step by step.

E is negative, so let’s express it as E = -|E|. Then κ = sqrt(2m|E|)/ħ. Since |E| = (m α2)/(2 ħ2), then substituting gives κ = sqrt(2m*(m α2)/(2 ħ2))/ħ) ) = sqrt( (m2 α2)/ħ2 ) / ħ ) = sqrt( m2 α2 ) / ( ħ ) * sqrt(1/ħ2 ) Wait, hold on, this might be a miscalculation.

Wait, let's compute κ again. Let me do it carefully.

Given E = - (m α2)/(2 ħ2). Then, since κ = sqrt(-2mE)/ħ, substitute E:

κ = sqrt( -2m*( -m α2 / (2 ħ2) )) / ħ )

Simplify the inside of the sqrt: the negatives cancel, so:

= sqrt( 2m*(m α2)/(2 ħ2) ) / ħ )

The 2m and 2 in the denominator cancel:

= sqrt( (m2 α2)/ħ2 ) / ħ )

Wait, inside the sqrt, we have (m2 α2)/(ħ2), so sqrt of that is (m α)/ħ. Then:

So κ = (m α)/ħ ) / ħ ) = m α / ħ2 ?

Wait, that can't be. Because normally, for the delta potential, the wavefunction is ψ(x) = sqrt(κ) e^{-κ |x| } with κ = m α / ħ2. Wait, but let me make sure.

Let me recall that for the delta potential, the bound state has wavefunction ψ(x) = sqrt( (m α)/ħ2 ) e^{ - m α |x| / ħ2 }.

Wait, if κ = m α / ħ2, then the exponent is -κ |x|, and the wavefunction is sqrt(κ) e^{-κ |x|}. That normalization makes sense, because when you integrate |ψ|^2 from -infty to infty, you get 1.

Integral of κ e^{-2 κ |x|} dx from -infty to infty. Since the function is even, that's 2κ integral from 0 to infty of e^{-2 κ x} dx = 2κ * (1/(2κ)) ) = 1. Correct, so the wavefunction is indeed normalized.

So κ in this case is m α / ħ2. Wait, but how did we arrive here? Let's check the energy again. The binding energy for the delta potential is E = - (m α2)/(2 ħ2). Then κ is sqrt(2m|E|)/ħ = sqrt(2m*(m α2/(2 ħ2)) ) / ħ = sqrt( m2 α2 / ħ2 ) / ħ = (m α / ħ ) / ħ = m α / ħ2. Yes, that makes sense. So κ = m α / ħ2. Okay, so the wavefunction is ψ(x) = sqrt(κ) e^{-κ |x|} = sqrt( m α / ħ2 ) e^{ - (m α / ħ2) |x| }.

So, the probability density is |ψ(x)|2 = (m α / ħ2) e^{-2 (m α / ħ2) |x| }.

Therefore, to find the probability that the particle is between -x0 and x0, we need to integrate |ψ(x)|2 from -x0 to x0.

But since the function is even, we can just compute 2 times the integral from 0 to x0.

So the probability P(-x0 < x < x0) = 2 * integral from 0 to x0 of |ψ(x)|2 dx = 2 * integral from 0 to x0 of (m α / ħ2) e^{-2 (m α / ħ2) x } dx.

Let me compute that integral.

Let’s call k = 2 m α / ħ2, so then the integrand is (k/2) e^{- k x} }, because m α / ħ2 = k/2. Wait, because the original term was:

|ψ(x)|2 = (m α / ħ2) e^{-2 (m α / ħ2) x }, so if I set κ = m α / ħ2, then |ψ(x)|2 = κ e^{-2 κ x }

So P = 2 * integral from 0 to x0 of κ e^{-2 κ x } dx = 2 κ integral from 0 to x0 e^{-2 κ x } dx

Let me compute the integral. The integral of e^{-2 κ x} dx is -1/(2 κ) e^{-2 κ x }, evaluated from 0 to x0.

So,

P = 2 κ [ -1/(2 κ) (e^{-2 κ x0 } - 1 ) ) ] = 2 κ * ( -1/(2 κ) )(e^{-2 κ x0 } - 1 ) )

Simplify:

The 2 and 1/2 cancel, κ cancels:

P = - (e^{-2 κ x0 } - 1 ) ) = 1 - e^{-2 κ x0 }

We set this equal to 1/2, so:

1 - e^{-2 κ x0 } = 1/2 --> e^{-2 κ x0 } = 1/2 --> -2 κ x0 = ln(1/2) = - ln 2

Therefore,

x0 = ( ln 2 ) / ( 2 κ )

But κ is equal to m α / ħ2, so substituting:

x0 = ( ln 2 ) / ( 2 * ( m α / ħ2 ) ) ) = ( ln 2 ) * ( ħ2 / (2 m α ) )

Which matches option (A): ln(2) [ħ2/(2 m α ) ]

Wait, let me check answer (A) is ln2*(ħ2/(2 m α))

Yes, answer choices is (A) ln(2) [ħ2/(2mα)]

But wait, looking back, is there an error here?

Wait, let me recap. κ = m α / ħ2. Then x0 = (ln2)/(2 κ) = (ln2)/(2*(m α/ħ2)) ) = (ln2 * ħ2)/(2 m α )

Which is exactly answer (A). So the answer should be (A). But I need to check if I have miscalculated.

Wait, another possible confusion is here. The expression for κ was derived correctly. Let's recap:

Energy of the bound state: E = - (m α2)/(2 ħ2 )

κ, defined from the wavefunction (exponent) is κ = sqrt(-2 m E)/ħ

Therefore, substituting E: sqrt(-2m*(-m α2/(2 ħ2)))/ħ = sqrt( m2 α2 / ħ2 ) / ħ ) = (m α / ħ ) / ħ = m α / ħ2. Correct.

Thus the parameters are all correctly substituted, and P = 1 - e^{-2 κ x0}

Set it equal to 1/2: e^{-2 κ x0} = 1/2 => -2κ x0 = -ln2 => x0 = ln2/(2κ ) = (ln2) * ( ħ2 )/(2 m α )

Which is option A. Therefore the correct answer should be (A)

But why are the other answer choices appearing? Let me check the answer options again.

(A) ln(2) [ħ2/(2mα)]

(B) ln(4) [ħ2/(2mα)]

(C) ln(2) [ħ2/(mα2)]

(D) ln(4) [ħ2/(mα2)]

So, according to the calculation, (A) is correct. Let me confirm the integral once again.

Probability is 1 - e^{-2κ x0} set to 1/2, gives e^{-2κ x0} = 1/2, solve for x0.

Yes, (-2κ x0) = ln(1/2) --> x0 = -ln(1/2)/(2κ ) = ln2/(2κ )

Then κ is m α / ħ2, so everything is as computed above.

Hmm... So, unless I missed a factor, which sometimes happens when setting up κ. Let me check the wavefunction. The wavefunction was ψ(x) = sqrt(κ) e^{-κ|x| }

Normalization:

Integral from -infty to infty of |ψ(x)|^2 dx = 2 Integral from 0 to infty κ e^{-2 κx} dx

= 2κ * [ -1/(2κ) e^{-2κx } ] from 0 to ∞ = 2κ * [ 0 - ( -1/(2κ) ) ] = 2κ * 1/(2κ ) = 1. Correct. So κ is correctly set here.

Hence, my calculation of the probability is correct. So answer is (A). The other options must be wrong. For example, (B) is ln4 but same factors as (A). Since ln4 is 2 ln2, perhaps if one substituted that exponent incorrectly, but no. ln(4) would come if the exponent were different.

Alternatively, if I somehow calculated 2 κ x0 instead of 2 κ x0 or similar.

Wait, but from the equation:

e^{-2 κ x0 } = 1/2 --> -2 κ x0 = ln(1/2)= - ln2 --> x0= (ln2)/(2 κ )

That gives (A). Alternatively, if someone thought κ was 2 m α /ħ^2 perhaps, that would lead to the answer being ln2/(2*(2 m α /ħ^2 )) = ln2 * ħ2/(4 m alpha ), which is (A)* (1/2 ) but that's a different answer. So if someone confused κ as 2 m alpha/h^2 instead.

But given the given answer options, and the proper calculations, the correct answer is (A). Therefore, I think answer is A.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{A}
