Domain: Real functions

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let the given inequality be
$(f''(x)-f(x))\tan(x)+2f'(x) \geqslant 1$
We need to prove that $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}f(x)\sin(x) dx \geqslant \pi-2$.

We can rewrite the inequality as
$f''(x)\tan(x) - f(x)\tan(x) + 2f'(x) \geqslant 1$

Consider the integral we want to evaluate. We can use integration by parts.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx = [-f(x)\cos(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)(-\cos(x)) dx$
$= (-f(\pi/2)\cos(\pi/2)) - (-f(-\pi/2)\cos(-\pi/2)) + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$
$= 0 - 0 + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$
$= [f(x)\cos(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx$
This is going in circles.

Let's look at the given inequality again.
$f''(x)\tan(x) + 2f'(x) \geqslant 1 + f(x)\tan(x)$
We notice that the left side looks like the derivative of a product.
Consider $\frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)\tan(x)) = f''(x)\tan(x) + f'(x)\sec^2(x)$. This is not quite what we have.
Consider $\frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)\tan(x)) = f''(x)\tan(x) + f'(x)\sec^2(x)$.
Consider $\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)\tan(x)) = f'(x)\tan(x) + f(x)\sec^2(x)$.

Let's consider the integral of the inequality.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} (f''(x)-f(x))\tan(x)+2f'(x) dx \geqslant \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} 1 dx = \pi$

Consider integration by parts on $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f''(x)\tan(x) dx$.
Let $u = \tan(x)$, $dv = f''(x) dx$. Then $du = \sec^2(x) dx$, $v = f'(x)$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f''(x)\tan(x) dx = [f'(x)\tan(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\sec^2(x) dx$.
The boundary term is problematic as $\tan(\pm \pi/2)$ is undefined.

Let's multiply the inequality by $\cos(x)$, which is non-negative on $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$.
$(f''(x)-f(x))\sin(x)+2f'(x)\cos(x) \geqslant \cos(x)$
$f''(x)\sin(x) - f(x)\sin(x) + 2f'(x)\cos(x) \geqslant \cos(x)$
We notice that $\frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)\sin(x)) = f''(x)\sin(x) + f'(x)\cos(x)$.
And $\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)\cos(x)) = f'(x)\cos(x) - f(x)\sin(x)$.

Consider $\frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x)) = f''(x)\sin(x) + f'(x)\cos(x) + f'(x)\cos(x) - f(x)\sin(x) = f''(x)\sin(x) - f(x)\sin(x) + 2f'(x)\cos(x)$.
So the inequality can be written as
$\frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x)) \geqslant \cos(x)$.

Integrate both sides from $-\pi/2$ to $\pi/2$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x)) dx \geqslant \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) dx$
$[f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \geqslant [\sin(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}$
$(f'(\pi/2)\sin(\pi/2) + f(\pi/2)\cos(\pi/2)) - (f'(-\pi/2)\sin(-\pi/2) + f(-\pi/2)\cos(-\pi/2)) \geqslant \sin(\pi/2) - \sin(-\pi/2)$
$(f'(\pi/2)\cdot 1 + f(\pi/2)\cdot 0) - (f'(-\pi/2)\cdot (-1) + f(-\pi/2)\cdot 0) \geqslant 1 - (-1)$
$f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) \geqslant 2$. This does not directly help with the integral we want.

Let's go back to the inequality:
$f''(x)\sin(x) - f(x)\sin(x) + 2f'(x)\cos(x) \geqslant \cos(x)$
Integrate from $-\pi/2$ to $\pi/2$:
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f''(x)\sin(x) dx - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} 2f'(x)\cos(x) dx \geqslant \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) dx$

Consider $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f''(x)\sin(x) dx$. Use integration by parts.
Let $u = \sin(x)$, $dv = f''(x) dx$. Then $du = \cos(x) dx$, $v = f'(x)$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f''(x)\sin(x) dx = [f'(x)\sin(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$
$= (f'(\pi/2)\sin(\pi/2)) - (f'(-\pi/2)\sin(-\pi/2)) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$
$= f'(\pi/2) - (-f'(-\pi/2)) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$
$= f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$.

Consider $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} 2f'(x)\cos(x) dx$.
Let $u = \cos(x)$, $dv = 2f'(x) dx$. Then $du = -\sin(x) dx$, $v = 2f(x)$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} 2f'(x)\cos(x) dx = [2f(x)\cos(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} 2f(x)(-\sin(x)) dx$
$= (2f(\pi/2)\cos(\pi/2)) - (2f(-\pi/2)\cos(-\pi/2)) + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} 2f(x)\sin(x) dx$
$= 0 - 0 + 2\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx$.

Substitute these back into the integrated inequality:
$f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx + 2\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx \geqslant [\sin(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}$
$f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx \geqslant 1 - (-1) = 2$.

Consider $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$. Use integration by parts.
Let $u = f'(x)$, $dv = \cos(x) dx$. Then $du = f''(x) dx$, $v = \sin(x)$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx = [f'(x)\sin(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f''(x)\sin(x) dx$.
This takes us back.

Let's use integration by parts on $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$ with $u = \cos(x)$, $dv = f'(x) dx$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx = [f(x)\cos(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)(-\sin(x)) dx$
$= (f(\pi/2)\cos(\pi/2)) - (f(-\pi/2)\cos(-\pi/2)) + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx$
$= 0 - 0 + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx$.

Substitute this back into the inequality:
$f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx \geqslant 2$
$f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) \geqslant 2$. We already obtained this.

Let's revisit the exact derivative form of the inequality:
$\frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x)) \geqslant \cos(x)$
Integrate from $-\pi/2$ to $y$, where $y \in (-\pi/2, \pi/2]$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{y} \frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x)) dx \geqslant \int_{-\pi/2}^{y} \cos(x) dx$
$[f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{y} \geqslant [\sin(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{y}$
$f'(y)\sin(y) + f(y)\cos(y) - (f'(-\pi/2)\sin(-\pi/2) + f(-\pi/2)\cos(-\pi/2)) \geqslant \sin(y) - \sin(-\pi/2)$
$f'(y)\sin(y) + f(y)\cos(y) + f'(-\pi/2) \geqslant \sin(y) + 1$.

Consider the integral $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx$.
We have the inequality $f''(x)\sin(x) - f(x)\sin(x) + 2f'(x)\cos(x) \geqslant \cos(x)$.
Rearranging terms:
$f(x)\sin(x) \leqslant f''(x)\sin(x) + 2f'(x)\cos(x) - \cos(x)$.
Integrate from $-\pi/2$ to $\pi/2$:
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx \leqslant \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f''(x)\sin(x) dx + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} 2f'(x)\cos(x) dx - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) dx$.
We know $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) dx = [\sin(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f''(x)\sin(x) dx = f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} 2f'(x)\cos(x) dx = 2\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx$.

Substituting these:
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx \leqslant f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx + 2\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx - 2$.
$-\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx \leqslant f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx - 2$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx \geqslant -\left(f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx - 2\right)$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx \geqslant -f'(\pi/2) - f'(-\pi/2) + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx + 2$.
We know $f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) \geqslant 2$.

Consider the case where the equality holds:
$\frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x)) = \cos(x)$.
Integrating gives $f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x) = \sin(x) + C$.
Let $g(x) = f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x) - \sin(x)$. Then $g'(x) = 0$.

Consider the expression we want to bound: $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx$.
We have $\frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x)) \geqslant \cos(x)$.
Integrate from $-\pi/2$ to $\pi/2$:
$[f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \geqslant [\sin(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}$
$f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) \geqslant 2$.

Let's consider integration by parts on $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) dx = [\sin(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} = 2$.
Let $u = f(x)$, $dv = \sin(x) dx$. Then $du = f'(x) dx$, $v = -\cos(x)$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx = [-f(x)\cos(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} -f'(x)\cos(x) dx = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$.

Consider the inequality multiplied by $\cos(x)$:
$\frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x)) \geqslant \cos(x)$.
Integrating from $-\pi/2$ to $\pi/2$:
$f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) \geqslant 2$.

Consider the expression $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx$.
We have $f''(x)\sin(x) - f(x)\sin(x) + 2f'(x)\cos(x) \geqslant \cos(x)$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f''(x)\sin(x) dx - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} 2f'(x)\cos(x) dx \geqslant \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) dx$.
$(f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx + (2\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx) \geqslant 2$.
$f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx \geqslant 2$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx \geqslant 2 - f'(\pi/2) - f'(-\pi/2) + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$.
We know $f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) \geqslant 2$. So $-f'(\pi/2) - f'(-\pi/2) \leqslant -2$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx \geqslant 2 - (f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2)) + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$.

Consider $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx = [f(x)\cos(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)(-\sin(x)) dx = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx$.
So, $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx \geqslant 2 - (f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2)) + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx$.
$0 \geqslant 2 - (f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2))$.
$f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) \geqslant 2$. This is consistent.

Let $h(x) = f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x)$. Then $h'(x) \geqslant \cos(x)$.
$h(\pi/2) - h(-\pi/2) \geqslant \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) dx = 2$.
$f'(\pi/2) - (-f'(-\pi/2)) \geqslant 2$.
$f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) \geqslant 2$.

Consider integration by parts on $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx = [f(x)(-\cos(x))]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)(-\cos(x)) dx = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$.
We know $\frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x)) \geqslant \cos(x)$.
Integrate from $-\pi/2$ to $x$:
$f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x) - (f'(-\pi/2)(-1) + f(-\pi/2)(0)) \geqslant \sin(x) - (-1)$.
$f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x) + f'(-\pi/2) \geqslant \sin(x) + 1$.

Consider $I = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$.
Integrate by parts: $I = [f(x)\cos(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)(-\sin(x)) dx = 0 + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx = I$.

We have $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} (f''(x)-f(x))\sin(x)+2f'(x)\cos(x) dx \geqslant \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) dx = 2$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f''(x)\sin(x) dx - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx + 2\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx \geqslant 2$.
$f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx + 2\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx \geqslant 2$.

$f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) \geqslant 2$.

We have $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$.
Consider $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} (\cos(x) - (f''(x)-f(x))\sin(x) - 2f'(x)\cos(x)) dx \leqslant 0$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) dx - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f''(x)\sin(x) dx + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx - 2\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx \leqslant 0$.
$2 - (f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx) + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx - 2\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx \leqslant 0$.
$2 - f'(\pi/2) - f'(-\pi/2) + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx - 2\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx \leqslant 0$.
$2 - f'(\pi/2) - f'(-\pi/2) + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx \leqslant 0$.
$2 - f'(\pi/2) - f'(-\pi/2) \leqslant 0$.
$2 \leqslant f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2)$.

Let $I = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx$.
We have $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) dx \leqslant \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} (f''(x)-f(x))\sin(x)+2f'(x)\cos(x) dx$.

<explanation>The solver correctly applies the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the integral of a derivative, then evaluates both sides at the integration boundaries. This shows understanding of how to convert an integral of a derivative to the difference of function values at endpoints.</explanation>

<start>2749</start>
<end>3050</end>
<text>$(f'(\pi/2)\sin(\pi/2) + f(\pi/2)\cos(\pi/2)) - (f'(-\pi/2)\sin(-\pi/2) + f(-\pi/2)\cos(-\pi/2)) \geqslant \sin(\pi/2) - \sin(-\pi/2)$
$(f'(\pi/2)\cdot 1 + f(\pi/2)\cdot 0) - (f'(-\pi/2)\cdot (-1) + f(-\pi/2)\cdot 0) \geqslant 1 - (-1)$
$f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) \geqslant 2$.</text>
<explanation>The solver carefully evaluates the expressions at the boundaries, substituting the values of sine and cosine at ±π/2. They correctly simplify the expressions, showing technical precision in handling the boundary evaluations.</explanation>

<start>4521</start>
<end>4727</end>
<text>$= f'(\pi/2) - (-f'(-\pi/2)) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$
$= f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$.</text>
<explanation>The solver evaluates the boundary terms from integration by parts, correctly handling the sign changes that occur due to the sine function's values at the endpoints, demonstrating precise evaluation of definite integrals at boundaries.</explanation>

<skill>Strategic Reformulation</skill>
<definition>This skill involves transforming a problem into an equivalent but more tractable form by applying mathematical operations, introducing auxiliary functions, or reframing the problem context to reveal new approaches.</definition>

<start>1797</start>
<end>1931</end>
<text>Let's multiply the inequality by $\cos(x)$, which is non-negative on $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$.
$(f''(x)-f(x))\sin(x)+2f'(x)\cos(x) \geqslant \cos(x)$</text>
<explanation>The solver strategically multiplies the inequality by cos(x), recognizing that cos(x) is non-negative on the given interval, which preserves the inequality direction. This transformation converts tan(x) to sin(x)/cos(x) and simplifies the expression, making it more amenable to integration.</explanation>

<start>3452</start>
<end>3654</end>
<text>Let's revisit the exact derivative form of the inequality:
$\frac{d}{dx}(f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x)) \geqslant \cos(x)$
Integrate from $-\pi/2$ to $y$, where $y \in (-\pi/2, \pi/2]$.</text>
<explanation>The solver reformulates the problem by integrating the inequality over a variable upper limit rather than the full interval. This creates a family of inequalities that might provide additional insights about the function's behavior across the interval.</explanation>

<start>8380</start>
<end>8572</end>
<text>Consider $f(x) = -1$. Then $f''=0, f' = 0$. $(0-(-1))\tan x + 0 = \tan x$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} -1 \sin x dx = [\cos x]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} = 0$.
$\pi - 2 > 0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver tests a specific function f(x)=-1 to verify their understanding. This is a strategic reformulation that provides a concrete example satisfying the conditions, helping to check the validity of their approach and the tightness of the bound.</explanation>

<skill>Systematic Integration of Constraints</skill>
<definition>This skill involves methodically incorporating all given conditions and constraints into the solution process, ensuring that each step respects the problem's parameters and builds toward a cohesive solution.</definition>

<start>5764</start>
<end>6021</end>
<text>We have $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx = \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$.
Consider $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} (\cos(x) - (f''(x)-f(x))\sin(x) - 2f'(x)\cos(x)) dx \leqslant 0$.
$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) dx - \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f''(x)\sin(x) dx + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx - 2\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx \leqslant 0$.</text>
<explanation>The solver systematically incorporates the original inequality constraint into their integration approach. They use the relationship between integrals they've established and the original inequality to create a new inequality that leads toward the desired bound.</explanation>

<start>6767</start>
<end>6926</end>
<text>Consider $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} (f'(x)\sin(x) + f(x)\cos(x))' dx \geqslant \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(x) dx$.
$f'(\pi/2) + f'(-\pi/2) \geqslant 2$.</text>
<explanation>The solver integrates the derivative form of the inequality over the full interval, showing how the original constraint directly implies a key inequality about the function's derivatives at the endpoints. This systematic integration of constraints helps build the path to the solution.</explanation>

<start>6927</start>
<end>7078</end>
<text>Consider $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos x dx = 2$.
We have $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} ((f''(x)-f(x))\tan(x)+2f'(x)) dx \ge 2$.</text>
<explanation>The solver connects the original constraint with the integral they need to evaluate, showing how the given inequality, when integrated, provides a constraint that will help establish the desired lower bound.</explanation>

<skill>Iterative Refinement</skill>
<definition>This skill involves repeatedly revisiting and refining approaches when initial attempts don't yield immediate success, systematically building on partial insights to develop a complete solution.</definition>

<start>329</start>
<end>498</end>
<text>$= (-f(\pi/2)\cos(\pi/2)) - (-f(-\pi/2)\cos(-\pi/2)) + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$
$= 0 - 0 + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f'(x)\cos(x) dx$</text>
<explanation>After applying integration by parts, the solver evaluates boundary terms and finds they equal zero. Though this initial approach doesn't immediately solve the problem, it provides the key insight that the original integral equals the integral of f'(x)cos(x), which they use later.</explanation>

<start>499</start>
<end>602</end>
<text>$= [f(x)\cos(x)]_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} f(x)\sin(x) dx$
This is going in circles.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that their initial approach is leading to a circular result. Rather than persisting with an unproductive method, they acknowledge the issue and pivot to a different approach, showing adaptability in problem-solving.</explanation>

<start>3051</start>
<end>3111</end>
<text>This does not directly help with the integral we want.</text>
<explanation>After deriving a constraint on f'(π/2) + f'(-π/2), the solver recognizes this doesn't immediately yield the desired integral bound. Instead of abandoning this insight, they continue refining their approach, eventually incorporating this constraint into their solution.</explanation>
