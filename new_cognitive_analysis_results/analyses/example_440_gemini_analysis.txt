(B) ln(4) [ℏ^2/2mα]
(C) ln(2) [ℏ^2/mα^2]
(D) ln(4) [ℏ^2/mα^2]

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
The problem asks for the value of x0 such that the probability of finding the particle within the interval [-x0, x0] is 1/2. To solve this, we need to find the wavefunction of the bound state and then calculate the probability integral.

First, let's recall the properties of the delta function potential. The potential V(x) = -α δ(x) has a single bound state. The energy of this bound state is given by E = -mα^2 / (2ℏ^2).

The wavefunction for the bound state is given by ψ(x) = A e^(-κ|x|), where κ = sqrt(-2mE/ℏ^2). Substituting the energy E, we get κ = sqrt(-2m(-mα^2 / (2ℏ^2))/ℏ^2) = sqrt(m^2α^2 / ℏ^4) = mα / ℏ^2.

So the wavefunction is ψ(x) = A e^(-(mα/ℏ^2)|x|).

Now we need to find the normalization constant A. We require that the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 over all space is equal to 1.
∫[-∞, ∞] |A e^(-(mα/ℏ^2)|x|)|^2 dx = 1
∫[-∞, ∞] A^2 e^(-2(mα/ℏ^2)|x|) dx = 1
A^2 [∫[-∞, 0] e^(2(mα/ℏ^2)x) dx + ∫[0, ∞] e^(-2(mα/ℏ^2)x) dx] = 1
Let β = 2mα/ℏ^2.
A^2 [∫[-∞, 0] e^(βx) dx + ∫[0, ∞] e^(-βx) dx] = 1
A^2 [[1/β e^(βx)] from -∞ to 0 + [-1/β e^(-βx)] from 0 to ∞] = 1
A^2 [(1/β (1 - 0)) + (-1/β (0 - 1))] = 1
A^2 [1/β + 1/β] = 1
A^2 [2/β] = 1
A^2 = β/2
A^2 = (2mα/ℏ^2) / 2 = mα/ℏ^2
A = sqrt(mα/ℏ^2)

So the normalized wavefunction is ψ(x) = sqrt(mα/ℏ^2) e^(-(mα/ℏ^2)|x|).

Now we need to find x0 such that the probability of finding the particle with |x| < x0 is 1/2. This means:
∫[-x0, x0] |ψ(x)|^2 dx = 1/2
∫[-x0, x0] (mα/ℏ^2) e^(-2(mα/ℏ^2)|x|) dx = 1/2
Let γ = 2mα/ℏ^2.
∫[-x0, x0] (γ/2) e^(-γ|x|) dx = 1/2
(γ/2) [∫[-x0, 0] e^(γx) dx + ∫[0, x0] e^(-γx) dx] = 1/2
(γ/2) [[1/γ e^(γx)] from -x0 to 0 + [-1/γ e^(-γx)] from 0 to x0] = 1/2
(γ/2) [(1/γ (1 - e^(-γx0))) + (-1/γ (e^(-γx0) - 1))] = 1/2
(γ/2) [1/γ - 1/γ e^(-γx0) - 1/γ e^(-γx0) + 1/γ] = 1/2
(γ/2) [2/γ - 2/γ e^(-γx0)] = 1/2
1 - e^(-γx0) = 1/2
e^(-γx0) = 1 - 1/2
e^(-γx0) = 1/2
-γx0 = ln(1/2)
-γx0 = -ln(2)
γx0 = ln(2)
x0 = ln(2) / γ
x0 = ln(2) / (2mα/ℏ^2)
x0 = ln(2) [ℏ^2 / (2mα)]

Comparing with the answer choices, option (A) matches our result.
