Problem:
A bored student walks down a hall that contains a row of closed lockers, numbered 1 to 1024. He opens the locker numbered 1, and then alternates between skipping and opening each locker thereafter. When he reaches the end of the hall, the student turns around and starts back. He opens the first closed locker he encounters, and then alternates between skipping and opening each closed locker thereafter. The student continues wandering back and forth in this manner until every locker is open. What is the number of the last locker he opens?

Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem describes a process of opening lockers in a row, based on a specific pattern of movement and selection. We need to determine the number of the last locker opened in this process.

The lockers are numbered from 1 to 1024. Initially, all lockers are closed.

Pass 1: Moving from locker 1 to 1024.
The student opens locker 1.
Skips locker 2.
Opens locker 3.
Skips locker 4.
...
The student opens lockers with odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., 1023.
Number of lockers opened in pass 1 = 512.
Lockers remaining closed after pass 1 are the even numbered lockers: 2, 4, 6, ..., 1024.

Pass 2: Moving from locker 1024 back to 1.
The student considers only the closed lockers: 2, 4, 6, ..., 1024.
These closed lockers can be re-indexed for this pass:
Locker 2 (original) -> 1st closed locker
Locker 4 (original) -> 2nd closed locker
Locker 6 (original) -> 3rd closed locker
...
Locker 1024 (original) -> 512th closed locker

The student opens the first closed locker encountered, which is locker 1024 (original number).
Then skips the next closed locker, which is locker 1022 (original number).
Opens the next closed locker, which is locker 1020 (original number).
Skips the next closed locker, which is locker 1018 (original number).

The opened lockers in this pass correspond to the closed lockers with odd indices in the re-indexed list of closed lockers.
Re-indexed closed lockers: 1 (original 2), 2 (original 4), 3 (original 6), ..., 512 (original 1024).
The student opens the closed lockers at indices 1, 3, 5, ...
Corresponding original locker numbers:
Index 1 -> Locker 2
Index 3 -> Locker 6
Index 5 -> Locker 10
...

The closed lockers have the form $2k$, where $k = 1, 2, ..., 512$.
The re-indexed list of closed lockers is $c_1=2, c_2=4, c_3=6, ..., c_{512}=1024$.
The student opens closed lockers $c_1, c_3, c_5, ...$
The indices are odd numbers from 1 to 511. The $n$-th odd number is $2n-1$.
The number of terms is such that $2n-1 \le 511$, so $2n \le 512$, $n \le 256$.
The odd indices are $1, 3, ..., 511$.

Original locker numbers opened in pass 2:
For index 1: $c_1 = 2$
For index 3: $c_3 = 6$
For index 5: $c_5 = 10$
...
For index 511: $c_{511} = 2 \times 511 = 1022$

Let's verify the pattern. The closed lockers are $2, 4, 6, ..., 1024$.
The student opens the 1st, skips the 2nd, opens the 3rd, skips the 4th, ... among the closed lockers.
Opens: 2 (1st), 6 (3rd), 10 (5th), ...
The $k$-th opened locker in this pass corresponds to the $(2k-1)$-th closed locker.
The original number of the opened locker is the $(2k-1)$-th even number, which is $2 \times (2k-1)$.
The number of closed lockers was 512. The number of opened lockers in this pass is $\lceil 512 / 2 \rceil = 256$.
The last opened locker corresponds to $k=256$, so $2 \times (2 \times 256 - 1) = 2 \times (512 - 1) = 2 \times 511 = 1022$.

Something is wrong here. Let's restart pass 2 carefully.

At the start of pass 2, closed lockers are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 1024.
Student moves from 1024 to 1.
First closed locker encountered is 1024. Opens it.
Next closed locker is 1022. Skips it.
Next closed locker is 1020. Opens it.
Next closed locker is 1018. Skips it.

The opened lockers in pass 2 are 1024, 1020, 1016, ...
These are of the form $1024 - 4k$, where $k=0, 1, 2, ...$
The last opened locker in this pass will be the smallest positive value of this form, until all closed lockers are considered.

The sequence of closed lockers encountered: 1024, 1022, 1020, 1018, ..., 2.
Opening the 1st (1024), skipping the 2nd (1022), opening the 3rd (1020), skipping the 4th (1018), ...
Opened lockers: 1024 (1st), 1020 (3rd), 1016 (5th), ...
These are the closed lockers at odd positions in the sequence of closed lockers.

The closed lockers are $c_1=2, c_2=4, ..., c_{512}=1024$.
In reverse order: $1024, 1022, ..., 4, 2$.
The student opens the 1st (1024), 3rd (1020), 5th (1016), ... closed locker encountered.
The $k$-th opened locker corresponds to the $(2k-1)$-th closed locker encountered.
The closed lockers encountered are in the order $1024, 1022, ..., 2$.
The $n$-th closed locker encountered is $1024 - 2(n-1)$.
The $(2k-1)$-th closed locker encountered is $1024 - 2((2k-1)-1) = 1024 - 2(2k-2) = 1024 - 4k + 4 = 1028 - 4k$.

Number of closed lockers at the start of pass 2 is 512.
Number of opened lockers in pass 2 is 256.
The last opened locker corresponds to $k=256$.
Locker number = $1028 - 4 \times 256 = 1028 - 1024 = 4$.

Let's check the opened lockers:
k=1: $1028 - 4 = 1024$
k=2: $1028 - 8 = 1020$
k=3: $1028 - 12 = 1016$
...
k=256: $1028 - 1024 = 4$

Opened lockers in pass 2: 1024, 1020, 1016, ..., 4.

Lockers opened after pass 2: Odd numbers (1, 3, ..., 1023) and 1024, 1020, ..., 4.
Remaining closed lockers are even numbers not in the sequence 1024, 1020, ..., 4.
The sequence 1024, 1020, ..., 4 can be written as $4 + 4k$, where $k = 0, 1, ..., 255$.
Even numbers are $2, 4, 6, ..., 1024$.
Closed after pass 2: Even numbers excluding those of the form $4k+4$.
Even numbers: $2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, ...$
Opened in pass 2: $1024, 1020, 1016, ..., 8, 4$.
Closed after pass 2: $2, 6, 10, 14, ..., 1022$.
These are numbers of the form $4k+2$.

Pass 3: Moving from locker 1 to 1024.
Closed lockers: 2, 6, 10, ..., 1022.
Re-index the closed lockers:
1st: 2
2nd: 6
3rd: 10
...
Number of closed lockers = 256.
The $n$-th closed locker is $2 + 4(n-1) = 4n - 2$.
$4n - 2 = 1022 \implies 4n = 1024 \implies n = 256$.

The student opens the 1st, skips the 2nd, opens the 3rd, ... among the closed lockers.
Opens the 1st (2), 3rd (10), 5th (18), ...
The $k$-th opened locker corresponds to the $(2k-1)$-th closed locker.
Original number of the opened locker: $4(2k-1) - 2 = 8k - 4 - 2 = 8k - 6$.

Number of closed lockers = 256. Number opened = 128.
Last opened locker corresponds to $k=128$.
Number = $8 \times 128 - 6 = 1024 - 6 = 1018$.

Opened in pass 3: 2, 10, 18, ..., 1018.
Closed after pass 3: 6, 14, 22, ..., 1022.
These are of the form $8k + 6$.

Pass 4: Moving from locker 1024 back to 1.
Closed lockers: 6, 14, 22, ..., 1022.
Re-index in reverse order: 1022, ..., 22, 14, 6.
Number of closed lockers = 128.
The $n$-th closed locker encountered is $1022 - 8(n-1) = 1022 - 8n + 8 = 1030 - 8n$.

Opens the 1st (1022), 3rd (1006), 5th (990), ...
The $k$-th opened locker corresponds to the $(2k-1)$-th closed locker encountered.
Original number of the opened locker: $1030 - 8(2k-1) = 1030 - 16k + 8 = 1038 - 16k$.

Number of closed lockers = 128. Number opened = 64.
Last opened locker corresponds to $k=64$.
Number = $1038 - 16 \times 64 = 1038 - 1024 = 14$.

Opened in pass 4: 1022, 1006, ..., 14.
Closed after pass 4: 1014, ..., 22, 6.
These are of the form $16k + 6$.

Observe a pattern:
Pass 1: Opens lockers with numbers $2^1 k - 1$, where $k$ is such that the number is within range.
Pass 2: Opens lockers related to numbers $2^2 k$.
Pass 3: Opens lockers related to numbers $2^3 k$.
Pass 4: Opens lockers related to numbers $2^4 k$.

Let $N = 1024 = 2^{10}$.

Consider the state of the lockers after each pass.
Initially, all closed.
After pass 1: Opened are numbers $\equiv 1 \pmod 2$. Closed are numbers $\equiv 0 \pmod 2$.
After pass 2: Opened are numbers $\equiv 1 \pmod 2$ and numbers of the form $4k$. Closed are numbers $\equiv 2 \pmod 4$.
Numbers opened: $1, 3, 5, ..., 1023$ and $4, 8, ..., 1024$.

Let's track the closed lockers.
Start: All closed.
After pass 1: Even numbers closed: $2, 4, ..., 1024$.
After pass 2: Closed are numbers of the form $4k+2$: $2, 6, 10, ..., 1022$.
After pass 3: Closed are numbers of the form $8k+6$: $6, 14, 22, ..., 1022$.
After pass 4: Closed are numbers of the form $16k+14$: $14, 30, ..., 1006$.

The form of closed lockers after pass $p$: $2^p k + c_p$.

After pass 1: $2k$.
After pass 2: $4k+2$.
After pass 3: $8k+6$.
After pass 4: $16k+14$.
The constant term $c_p = 2^p - 2$.
Closed lockers after pass $p$: $2^p k + 2^p - 2$.

Direction of movement: Right (pass 1), Left (pass 2), Right (pass 3), Left (pass 4), ...
Pass $p$ moves right if $p$ is odd, left if $p$ is even.

Consider the number of closed lockers at the start of each pass.
Start: 1024.
Pass 1: 512.
Pass 2: 256.
Pass 3: 128.
Pass 4: 64.
Pass 5: 32.
Pass 6: 16.
Pass 7: 8.
Pass 8: 4.
Pass 9: 2.
Pass 10: 1.

Consider the last locker opened in each pass.
Pass 1: 1023.
Pass 2: 4.
Pass 3: 1018.
Pass 4: 14.

The process continues until only one closed locker remains, which will be opened in the final step.

Consider the case with fewer lockers, e.g., 8 lockers.
Pass 1 (right): Open 1, 3, 5, 7. Closed: 2, 4, 6, 8. Last opened: 7.
Pass 2 (left): Closed: 8, 6, 4, 2. Open 8, 4. Closed: 6, 2. Last opened: 4.
Pass 3 (right): Closed: 2, 6. Open 2. Closed: 6. Last opened: 2.
Pass 4 (left): Closed: 6. Open 6. Last opened: 6.

Let $L = 8$.
Pass 1: Opens odd numbers. Last opened: $L-1 = 7$.
Closed: $2, 4, 6, 8$.
Pass 2: Considers $8, 6, 4, 2$. Opens 8, 4. Last opened: 4.
Pass 3: Considers 2, 6. Opens 2. Last opened: 2.
Pass 4: Considers 6. Opens 6. Last opened: 6.

Consider $L = 16$.
Pass 1: Open 1, 3, ..., 15. Last opened: 15. Closed: 2, 4, ..., 16.
Pass 2: Closed: 16, 14, ..., 2. Open 16, 12, 8, 4. Last opened: 4.
Closed: 14, 10, 6, 2.
Pass 3: Closed: 2, 6, 10, 14. Open 2, 10. Last opened: 10.
Closed: 6, 14.
Pass 4: Closed: 14, 6. Open 14. Last opened: 14.
Closed: 6.
Pass 5: Closed: 6. Open 6. Last opened: 6.

The last locker opened seems to be related to powers of 2.

Let $f(n)$ be the number of the last locker opened with $n$ lockers.
$f(2) = 2$.
Pass 1: Open 1. Closed: 2.
Pass 2: Open 2. Last opened: 2.

$f(4) = 4$.
Pass 1: Open 1, 3. Closed: 2, 4.
Pass 2: Closed: 4, 2. Open 4. Closed: 2.
Pass 3: Closed: 2. Open 2. Last opened: 2.

Error in the 4 locker case.
Pass 1: Open 1, 3. Closed: 2, 4.
Pass 2: Closed: 4, 2. Open 4. Closed: 2.
Pass 3: Closed: 2. Open 2. Last opened: 2.
Last opened is 2.

$f(8) = 6$.

Consider the Josephus problem variant.

Consider the binary representation of the locker numbers.
After pass 1, the last bit is 1 for opened, 0 for closed.
Closed lockers have form $X0$.

Pass 2 considers closed lockers in reverse order.
Example: 8 lockers. Closed: 8(1000), 6(0110), 4(0100), 2(0010).
Re-indexed: 1(8), 2(6), 3(4), 4(2).
Opens 1(8), 3(4).
Opened: 8, 4.
Remaining closed: 6, 2.

Consider the number of closed lockers remaining.
Start: $N$.
After pass 1: $N/2$.
After pass 2: $N/4$.
After pass $k$: $N / 2^k$.

The process stops when only one locker remains.
This happens after 10 passes for 1024 lockers.

Consider the winner of the Josephus problem.
If $n = 2^m + l$, the winner is $2l + 1$.

Think about the final remaining locker.

Consider the case of powers of 2.
$N=2$: Last opened 2.
$N=4$: Last opened 2.
$N=8$: Last opened 6.

If $N = 2^k$, the last locker opened is $2^{k}-2$.

The number of lockers is $1024 = 2^{10}$.
The last locker opened should be $2^{10} - 2 = 1024 - 2 = 1022$.

Final check.
At the end, only one locker remains closed, which is opened in the final step.
Consider the survivor.

SUMMARY_START
The most important cognitive skills demonstrated in this mathematical problem-solving trajectory are:

1. Pattern Recognition - The solver identifies mathematical patterns in the sequences of opened and closed lockers, eventually formulating a general expression for closed lockers after each pass.

2. Systematic Exploration - The solver methodically examines smaller cases (8 and 16 lockers) to gain insight into the problem structure before generalizing.

3. Algorithmic Thinking - The solver breaks down the process into clear steps, tracking the state of lockers through each pass and developing a procedural understanding of the problem.

4. Mathematical Formalization - The solver translates the verbal problem into precise mathematical notation, using variables, indices, and algebraic expressions to represent patterns.

5. Hypothesis Testing - The solver formulates and tests conjectures about the solution pattern, correcting errors and ultimately arriving at a general formula for the last locker opened.
