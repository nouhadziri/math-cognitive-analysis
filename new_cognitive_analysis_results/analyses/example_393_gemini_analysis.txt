Problem:
A mixture of ideal gas containing 5 moles of monatomic gas and 1 mole of rigid diatomic gas is initially at pressure $P_{0}$, volume $V_{0}$, and temperature $T_{0}$. If the gas mixture is adiabatically compressed to a volume $V_{0} / 4$, then the correct statement(s) is/are, (Given $2^{1.2}=2.3 ; 2^{3.2}=9.2 ; R$ is gas constant)

(A) The work $|W|$ done during the process is $13 R T_{0}$

(B) The average kinetic energy of the gas mixture after compression is in between $18 R T_{0}$ and $19 R T_{0}$

(C) The final pressure of the gas mixture after compression is in between $9 P_{0}$ and $10 P_{0}$

(D) Adiabatic constant of the gas mixture is 1.6

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let $n_1$ be the number of moles of monatomic gas and $n_2$ be the number of moles of rigid diatomic gas.
Given: $n_1 = 5$ moles, $n_2 = 1$ mole.
The total number of moles in the mixture is $n = n_1 + n_2 = 5 + 1 = 6$ moles.

Initial state: Pressure $P_0$, Volume $V_0$, Temperature $T_0$.
Final state: Volume $V_f = V_0 / 4$.

For an adiabatic process, $PV^\gamma = \text{constant}$ and $TV^{\gamma-1} = \text{constant}$.
The adiabatic constant $\gamma$ for a mixture of ideal gases is given by:
$\gamma = \frac{n_1 C_{P1} + n_2 C_{P2}}{n_1 C_{V1} + n_2 C_{V2}}$
For a monatomic gas, $C_{V1} = \frac{3}{2}R$ and $C_{P1} = C_{V1} + R = \frac{5}{2}R$.
For a rigid diatomic gas, $C_{V2} = \frac{5}{2}R$ and $C_{P2} = C_{V2} + R = \frac{7}{2}R$.

$\gamma = \frac{5 \times \frac{5}{2}R + 1 \times \frac{7}{2}R}{5 \times \frac{3}{2}R + 1 \times \frac{5}{2}R} = \frac{\frac{25}{2}R + \frac{7}{2}R}{\frac{15}{2}R + \frac{5}{2}R} = \frac{\frac{32}{2}R}{\frac{20}{2}R} = \frac{16R}{10R} = 1.6$
So, option (D) is correct.

Now, let's find the final pressure using the adiabatic relation $P_0 V_0^\gamma = P_f V_f^\gamma$.
$P_f = P_0 \left(\frac{V_0}{V_f}\right)^\gamma = P_0 \left(\frac{V_0}{V_0/4}\right)^{1.6} = P_0 (4)^{1.6} = P_0 (2^2)^{1.6} = P_0 2^{3.2}$
Given $2^{3.2} = 9.2$.
So, $P_f = 9.2 P_0$.
The final pressure of the gas mixture is $9.2 P_0$, which is between $9 P_0$ and $10 P_0$.
So, option (C) is correct.

Now, let's find the final temperature using the adiabatic relation $T_0 V_0^{\gamma-1} = T_f V_f^{\gamma-1}$.
$T_f = T_0 \left(\frac{V_0}{V_f}\right)^{\gamma-1} = T_0 \left(\frac{V_0}{V_0/4}\right)^{1.6-1} = T_0 (4)^{0.6} = T_0 (2^2)^{0.6} = T_0 2^{1.2}$
Given $2^{1.2} = 2.3$.
So, $T_f = 2.3 T_0$.

The work done during an adiabatic process is given by $W = \frac{P_f V_f - P_0 V_0}{1 - \gamma}$.
$P_0 V_0 = n R T_0 = 6 R T_0$
$P_f V_f = 9.2 P_0 \times \frac{V_0}{4} = \frac{9.2}{4} P_0 V_0 = 2.3 P_0 V_0 = 2.3 \times 6 R T_0 = 13.8 R T_0$
$W = \frac{13.8 R T_0 - 6 R T_0}{1 - 1.6} = \frac{7.8 R T_0}{-0.6} = -13 R T_0$
The work done on the gas is $|W| = 13 R T_0$.
So, option (A) is correct.

The average kinetic energy per mole of a gas is $\frac{f}{2}RT$, where $f$ is the degrees of freedom.
For the mixture, the average kinetic energy per molecule is given by the weighted average of the kinetic energies of the individual gases.
However, the question asks for the average kinetic energy of the gas mixture, which is the total kinetic energy.
The total internal energy $U = n_1 C_{V1} T + n_2 C_{V2} T$.
The average kinetic energy of the gas mixture is the total internal energy.
Initial internal energy $U_i = n_1 \frac{3}{2} R T_0 + n_2 \frac{5}{2} R T_0 = 5 \times \frac{3}{2} R T_0 + 1 \times \frac{5}{2} R T_0 = \frac{15}{2} R T_0 + \frac{5}{2} R T_0 = \frac{20}{2} R T_0 = 10 R T_0$.
Final internal energy $U_f = n_1 \frac{3}{2} R T_f + n_2 \frac{5}{2} R T_f = (n_1 \frac{3}{2} R + n_2 \frac{5}{2} R) T_f = (5 \times \frac{3}{2} R + 1 \times \frac{5}{2} R) 2.3 T_0 = (\frac{15}{2} R + \frac{5}{2} R) 2.3 T_0 = \frac{20}{2} R \times 2.3 T_0 = 10 R \times 2.3 T_0 = 23 R T_0$.
The average kinetic energy of the gas mixture after compression is $U_f = 23 R T_0$.
This is not between $18 R T_0$ and $19 R T_0$.
So, option (B) is incorrect.

Let's double-check the definition of average kinetic energy of the gas mixture. It usually refers to the kinetic energy per molecule or per mole. If it means the total kinetic energy, then the above calculation is correct. If it means per mole of mixture, we need to divide by the total number of moles.
Average kinetic energy per mole of mixture initially = $\frac{U_i}{n} = \frac{10 R T_0}{6} = \frac{5}{3} R T_0$.
Average kinetic energy per mole of mixture finally = $\frac{U_f}{n} = \frac{23 R T_0}{6} = 3.83 R T_0$. This is still not in the range of $18 R T_0$ and $19 R T_0$.

The wording "average kinetic energy of the gas mixture" most likely refers to the total kinetic energy.
The total kinetic energy of the gas mixture is equal to its internal energy.
Initial internal energy $U_i = \frac{f_{mix}}{2} n R T_0$, where $f_{mix}$ is the average degrees of freedom.
$f_{mix} = \frac{n_1 f_1 + n_2 f_2}{n_1 + n_2} = \frac{5 \times 3 + 1 \times 5}{5+1} = \frac{15+5}{6} = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3}$.
$U_i = \frac{10/3}{2} \times 6 R T_0 = \frac{5}{3} \times 6 R T_0 = 10 R T_0$.
Final internal energy $U_f = \frac{f_{mix}}{2} n R T_f = \frac{10}{6} \times 6 R \times 2.3 T_0 = 10 \times 2.3 R T_0 = 23 R T_0$.

Double check the work done calculation:
$W = \Delta U = U_f - U_i = 23 R T_0 - 10 R T_0 = 13 R T_0$.
Since it's an adiabatic compression, work is done on the gas, so $W$ is positive. The work done by the gas is $-13 R T_0$, so $|W| = 13 R T_0$.

Final check of all options.
(A) The work $|W|$ done during the process is $13 R T_{0}$ - Correct.
(B) The average kinetic energy of the gas mixture after compression is in between $18 R T_{0}$ and $19 R T_{0}$ - Incorrect. The average kinetic energy (total internal energy) is $23 R T_0$.
(C) The final pressure of the gas mixture after compression is in between $9 P_{0}$ and $10 P_{0}$ - Correct. $P_f = 9.2 P_0$.
(D) Adiabatic constant of the gas mixture is 1.6 - Correct.
