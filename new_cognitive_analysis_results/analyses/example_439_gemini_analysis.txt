Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let G be a group with m elements and H be a proper subgroup of G with n elements.
For each x in G, we denote $H^x = \{xhx^{-1} \mid h \in H\}$.
We are given that $H^x \cap H = \{e\}$, for all $x \in G - H$.

a) Prove that $H^x = H^y$ if and only if $x^{-1}y \in H$.

($\Rightarrow$) Assume $H^x = H^y$.
Then for every $h \in H$, there exists $h' \in H$ such that $xhx^{-1} = y h' y^{-1}$.
This implies $y^{-1}xhx^{-1}y = h'$.
Let $z = x^{-1}y$. Then $y = xz$.
$H^x = \{xhx^{-1} \mid h \in H\}$
$H^y = \{yhy^{-1} \mid h \in H\} = \{xzh(xz)^{-1} \mid h \in H\} = \{xzhz^{-1}x^{-1} \mid h \in H\}$
If $H^x = H^y$, then for every $h \in H$, there exists $h' \in H$ such that $xhx^{-1} = y h' y^{-1}$.
Also for every $k \in H$, there exists $k' \in H$ such that $yky^{-1} = x k' x^{-1}$.
Consider $h \in H$. Then $xhx^{-1} \in H^x = H^y$.
So $xhx^{-1} = y h' y^{-1}$ for some $h' \in H$.
Multiply by $y^{-1}$ on the left and $y$ on the right: $y^{-1}xhx^{-1}y = h'$.
Let $g = x^{-1}y$. Then $y = xg$.
$H^y = \{xgh(xg)^{-1} \mid h \in H\} = \{xghg^{-1}x^{-1} \mid h \in H\}$.
If $H^x = H^y$, then for every $h_1 \in H$, there is $h_2 \in H$ such that $xh_1x^{-1} = y h_2 y^{-1}$.
And for every $h_3 \in H$, there is $h_4 \in H$ such that $y h_3 y^{-1} = x h_4 x^{-1}$.
So, for every $h_1 \in H$, there is $h_2 \in H$ such that $h_2 = y^{-1} x h_1 x^{-1} y$.
Consider $x^{-1}y$. If $x^{-1}y \in H$, let $x^{-1}y = h_0 \in H$. Then $y = xh_0$.
$H^y = \{xh_0 h (xh_0)^{-1} \mid h \in H\} = \{xh_0 h h_0^{-1} x^{-1} \mid h \in H\}$.
This does not seem to lead to $H^x$.

Let's restart the forward direction.
Assume $H^x = H^y$. Then for any $h \in H$, $xhx^{-1} \in H^y$.
So $xhx^{-1} = y h' y^{-1}$ for some $h' \in H$.
This implies $y^{-1}xhx^{-1}y = h'$.
Since $h'$ can be any element in $H$, for any $h' \in H$, there exists $h \in H$ such that $y^{-1}xhx^{-1}y = h'$.
This means the map $\phi: H \to H$ defined by $\phi(h) = y^{-1}xhx^{-1}y$ is surjective.
Since $H$ is finite, this map is also injective.
So for every $h' \in H$, there is a unique $h \in H$.

Consider the case where $x^{-1}y \in H$. Let $x^{-1}y = h_0 \in H$.
Then $y = xh_0$.
$H^y = \{yhy^{-1} \mid h \in H\} = \{xh_0 h (xh_0)^{-1} \mid h \in H\} = \{xh_0 h h_0^{-1} x^{-1} \mid h \in H\}$.
Let $h' = h_0 h h_0^{-1}$. Since $H$ is a subgroup, $h' \in H$.
So $H^y = \{xh'x^{-1} \mid h' \in H\} = H^x$.

($\Leftarrow$) Assume $x^{-1}y \in H$. Let $x^{-1}y = h_0 \in H$. Then $y = xh_0$.
$H^y = \{yhy^{-1} \mid h \in H\} = \{xh_0 h (xh_0)^{-1} \mid h \in H\} = \{xh_0 h h_0^{-1} x^{-1} \mid h \in H\}$.
Let $h' = h_0 h h_0^{-1}$. Since $H$ is a subgroup, $h' \in H$.
As $h$ ranges over all elements of $H$, $h_0 h h_0^{-1}$ also ranges over all elements of $H$ because the map $\phi_{h_0}: H \to H$ defined by $\phi_{h_0}(h) = h_0 h h_0^{-1}$ is an automorphism of $H$.
So $H^y = \{xh'x^{-1} \mid h' \in H\} = H^x$.

b) Find the number of elements of the set $\bigcup_{x\in G} H^x$ as a function of $m$ and $n$.

The set $\bigcup_{x\in G} H^x$ is the set of all conjugates of $H$.
We have shown that $H^x = H^y$ if and only if $x^{-1}y \in H$.
This is equivalent to $y \in xH$.
The distinct conjugates of $H$ correspond to the distinct left cosets of $H$ in $G$.
The number of distinct left cosets of $H$ in $G$ is the index of $H$ in $G$, which is $[G:H] = |G|/|H| = m/n$.
Let the distinct left cosets be $g_1 H, g_2 H, \dots, g_{m/n} H$.
The distinct conjugates are $H^{g_1}, H^{g_2}, \dots, H^{g_{m/n}}$.

We need to find the number of elements in $\bigcup_{x\in G} H^x = \bigcup_{i=1}^{m/n} H^{g_i}$.
We are given that $H^x \cap H = \{e\}$ for all $x \in G - H$.
If $x \in H$, then $H^x = \{xhx^{-1} \mid h \in H\} = H$.

Consider two distinct conjugates $H^x$ and $H^y$.
If $H^x \neq H^y$, then $x^{-1}y \notin H$, so $y \notin xH$.
We need to find the number of elements in the union of these conjugate subgroups.
Let the distinct conjugates be $H_1, H_2, \dots, H_k$, where $k = m/n$.
We know $|H_i| = |H| = n$ for all $i$.
We are given that for $x \notin H$, $H^x \cap H = \{e\}$.
Consider two distinct conjugates $H^x$ and $H^y$, where $y \notin xH$.
We need to find the intersection of $H^x$ and $H^y$.
Let $g \in H^x \cap H^y$.
Then $g = x h_1 x^{-1}$ for some $h_1 \in H$, and $g = y h_2 y^{-1}$ for some $h_2 \in H$.
So $x h_1 x^{-1} = y h_2 y^{-1}$.
$y^{-1} x h_1 x^{-1} y = h_2$.
$(x^{-1}y)^{-1} h_1 (x^{-1}y) = h_2$.
Let $z = x^{-1}y$. Then $z^{-1} h_1 z = h_2$.
We know that if $H^x \neq H^y$, then $x^{-1}y \notin H$.

Consider the intersection of two distinct conjugates $H^x$ and $H^y$.
If $H^x \cap H^y \neq \{e\}$, then there exists $g \neq e$ such that $g \in H^x$ and $g \in H^y$.
$g = x h_1 x^{-1} = y h_2 y^{-1}$ for some $h_1, h_2 \in H$, $h_1 \neq e, h_2 \neq e$.
$y^{-1} x h_1 x^{-1} y = h_2$.
$(x^{-1}y)^{-1} h_1 (x^{-1}y) = h_2$.
Let $z = x^{-1}y$. Since $H^x \neq H^y$, $z \notin H$.
We have $z^{-1} h_1 z = h_2 \in H$.
This means $h_1 \in z H z^{-1} = H^z$.
So $h_1 \in H \cap H^z$.
Since $z = x^{-1}y$ and $H^x \neq H^y$, we know $z \notin H$.
By the given condition, $H \cap H^z = \{e\}$.
So $h_1 = e$, which is a contradiction.
Therefore, if $H^x \neq H^y$, then $H^x \cap H^y = \{e\}$.

The distinct conjugates are $H = H^{e}$, and $H^x$ for representatives of the cosets $G/H - \{H\}$.
The number of such cosets is $m/n - 1$.
For each coset $xH$ where $x \notin H$, $H^x$ is a conjugate, and $H^x \cap H = \{e\}$.
The number of distinct conjugates is $m/n$.
The conjugates are $H^{g_1}, H^{g_2}, \dots, H^{g_{m/n}}$, where $g_i$ are representatives of the left cosets.
Let $C = \bigcup_{x \in G} H^x$.
$C = H \cup \bigcup_{x \in G - H} H^x$.
The distinct conjugates are $H$ and $H^x$ where $x$ belongs to a coset different from $H$.
Consider the set of distinct conjugates $\{H^{g_1}, H^{g_2}, \dots, H^{g_{m/n}}\}$ where $g_1 = e$.
The number of elements in the union is given by the inclusion-exclusion principle.
However, we know that the intersection of two distinct conjugates is $\{e\}$.
The number of elements in the union is $\sum_{i=1}^{m/n} |H^{g_i}| - (m/n - 1) |\{e\}|$.
Number of elements $= \sum_{i=1}^{m/n} n - (m/n - 1) \times 1 = n \times (m/n) - m/n + 1 = m - m/n + 1$.

Let's verify this.
The distinct conjugates are $H = H^e$ and $H^x$ for representatives of the cosets other than $H$.
Number of such cosets is $m/n - 1$.
For each such coset, pick a representative $x$. The conjugate is $H^x$.
We know $H^x \cap H = \{e\}$ for $x \notin H$.
Consider two representatives $x, y$ from different cosets (not $H$).
If $H^x = H^y$, then $x^{-1}y \in H$, which means $y \in xH$, but the cosets are different, so this is not possible.
So for each coset different from $H$, we get a distinct conjugate whose intersection with $H$ is $\{e\}$.
The distinct conjugates are $H$ and $H^{g_2}, \dots, H^{g_{m/n}}$, where $g_i \notin H$.
The elements in $H$ (excluding $e$) are $n-1$.
The elements in $H^{g_i}$ (excluding $e$) are $n-1$.
The number of distinct conjugates other than $H$ is $m/n - 1$.
The elements in $H$ are $n$.
The elements in $H^{g_i}$ are $n$.
The union is $H \cup H^{g_2} \cup \dots \cup H^{g_{m/n}}$.
The intersections are pairwise $\{e\}$.
The number of elements is $|H| + |H^{g_2} \setminus \{e\}| + \dots + |H^{g_{m/n}} \setminus \{e\}|$.
Number of elements $= n + (n-1) + (n-1) + \dots + (n-1)$ ($m/n - 1$ times).
Number of elements $= n + (m/n - 1)(n-1) = n + mn/n - m - n/n + 1 = n + m - m - 1 + 1 = n$. This is wrong.

Let the distinct conjugates be $K_1, K_2, \dots, K_{m/n}$, where $K_1 = H$.
The number of elements in $\bigcup_{i=1}^{m/n} K_i$.
$|K_i| = n$.
$K_i \cap K_j = \{e\}$ for $i \neq j$.
The number of elements is $|K_1 \setminus \{e\} \cup K_2 \setminus \{e\} \cup \dots \cup K_{m/n} \setminus \{e\} \cup \{e\}|$.
The sets $K_i \setminus \{e\}$ are disjoint.
The number of elements is $|K_1 \setminus \{e\}| + |K_2 \setminus \{e\}| + \dots + |K_{m/n} \setminus \{e\}| + 1$.
Number of elements $= (n-1) + (n-1) + \dots + (n-1)$ ($m/n$ times) $+ 1$.
Number of elements $= (m/n)(n-1) + 1 = m - m/n + 1$.

Let's write down the argument clearly.
The distinct conjugates of $H$ are $H^g$ where $g$ ranges over a set of representatives of the left cosets $G/H$.
The number of distinct conjugates is $m/n$. Let them be $H_1, H_2, \dots, H_{m/n}$.
One of these is $H$, say $H_1 = H$.
For any other conjugate $H_i$ where $i \neq 1$, $H_i = H^x$ for some $x \notin H$.
We are given that $H^x \cap H = \{e\}$ for $x \notin H$.
Consider two distinct conjugates $H^x$ and $H^y$. If $H^x \neq H^y$, then $x^{-1}y \notin H$.
Let $g \in H^x \cap H^y$. Then $g = x h_1 x^{-1} = y h_2 y^{-1}$ for some $h_1, h_2 \in H$.
$y^{-1} x h_1 x^{-1} y = h_2$.
$(x^{-1}y)^{-1} h_1 (x^{-1}y) = h_2$.
Let $z = x^{-1}y$. Since $H^x \neq H^y$, $z \notin H$.
$z^{-1} h_1 z = h_2 \in H$, so $h_1 \in z H z^{-1} = H^z$.
$h_1 \in H \cap H^z = \{e\}$. So $h_1 = e$.
Then $g = x e x^{-1} = e$.
So if $H^x \neq H^y$, then $H^x \cap H^y = \{e\}$.

The set $\bigcup_{x\in G} H^x$ is the union of the distinct conjugates of $H$.
Let the distinct conjugates be $K_1, K_2, \dots, K_{m/n}$.
The number of elements in the union is the sum of the number of elements in each conjugate minus the sum of the number of elements in pairwise intersections plus ...
Since the intersection of any two distinct conjugates is $\{e\}$, the formula simplifies.
$|\bigcup_{i=1}^{m/n} K_i| = \sum_{i=1}^{m/n} |K_i| - \sum_{i<j} |K_i \cap K_j| + \dots$
$|\bigcup_{i=1}^{m/n} K_i| = \sum_{i=1}^{m/n} |K_i| - \sum_{i<j} |\{e\}| = \sum_{i=1}^{m/n} n - \binom{m/n}{2} \times 1$. This is wrong.

Consider the elements in each conjugate excluding the identity.
$|K_i \setminus \{e\}| = n-1$.
The sets $K_i \setminus \{e\}$ are disjoint.
The union is $(\bigcup_{i=1}^{m/n} K_i \setminus \{e\}) \cup \{e\}$.
The number of elements is $\sum_{i=1}^{m/n} |K_i \setminus \{e\}| + 1 = \sum_{i=1}^{m/n} (n-1) + 1 = (m/n)(n-1) + 1 = m - m/n + 1$.

$y^{-1} x h_1 x^{-1} y = h_2$.
$(x^{-1}y)^{-1} h_1 (x^{-1}y) = h_2$.
Let $z = x^{-1}y$. Since $H^x \neq H^y$, $z \notin H$.
We have $z^{-1} h_1 z = h_2 \in H$.
This means $h_1 \in z H z^{-1} = H^z$.
So $h_1 \in H \cap H^z$.
