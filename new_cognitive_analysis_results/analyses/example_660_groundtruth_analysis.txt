Problem:
Consider a three-person game involving the following three types of fair six-sided dice. - Dice of type $A$ have faces labelled $2,2,4,4,9,9$. - Dice of type $B$ have faces labelled $1,1,6,6,8,8$. - Dice of type $C$ have faces labelled $3,3,5,5,7,7$. All three players simultaneously choose a die (more than one person can choose the same type of die, and the players don't know one another's choices) and roll it. Then the score of a player $P$ is the number of players whose roll is less than $P$ 's roll (and hence is either 0,1 , or 2 ). Assuming all three players play optimally, what is the expected score of a particular player?

Domain: Other

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
Short version: third player doesn't matter; against 1 opponent, by symmetry, you'd both play the same strategy. Type A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A all with probability $5 / 9$. It can be determined that choosing each die with probability $1 / 3$ is the best strategy. Then, whatever you pick, there is a $1 / 3$ of dominating, a $1 / 3$ chance of getting dominated, and a $1 / 3$ chance of picking the same die (which gives a $1 / 3 \cdot 2 / 3+1 / 3 \cdot 1 / 3=1 / 3$ chance of rolling a higher number). Fix your selection; then the expected payout is then $1 / 3 \cdot 5 / 9+1 / 3 \cdot 4 / 9+1 / 3 \cdot 1 / 3=1 / 3+1 / 9=4 / 9$. Against 2 players, your EV is just $E(p 1)+E(p 2)=2 E(p 1)=8 / 9$

<explanation>The solver immediately frames this as a game theory problem, identifying the strategic interaction between players. They recognize the cyclic dominance pattern (A beats B, B beats C, C beats A) and calculate the probability of winning in each matchup. This demonstrates understanding of game theory concepts like symmetry and strategic equivalence.</explanation>

<text>It can be determined that choosing each die with probability $1 / 3$ is the best strategy.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies the mixed strategy equilibrium where each player randomizes equally among the three die types. This is a sophisticated game theory concept - recognizing that in this rock-paper-scissors-like scenario, the optimal strategy is to randomize choices to prevent being exploited.</explanation>

<text>Then, whatever you pick, there is a $1 / 3$ of dominating, a $1 / 3$ chance of getting dominated, and a $1 / 3$ chance of picking the same die (which gives a $1 / 3 \cdot 2 / 3+1 / 3 \cdot 1 / 3=1 / 3$ chance of rolling a higher number).</text>
<explanation>The solver calculates the probabilities of different outcomes based on die selection. They compute the probability of winning when both players choose the same die type by analyzing the probability of rolling a higher number. This demonstrates sophisticated probability calculation skills, including breaking down compound events and computing conditional probabilities.</explanation>

<text>Fix your selection; then the expected payout is then $1 / 3 \cdot 5 / 9+1 / 3 \cdot 4 / 9+1 / 3 \cdot 1 / 3=1 / 3+1 / 9=4 / 9$.</text>
<explanation>The solver calculates the expected value by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and summing them. This shows mastery of expected value calculations, a fundamental concept in probability theory.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver computes the expected score by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and summing these products. They consider all three cases: dominating an opponent (5/9 probability of winning), being dominated (4/9 probability of losing), and choosing the same die (1/3 probability of winning). This demonstrates advanced expected value computation skills.</explanation>

<text>Against 2 players, your EV is just $E(p 1)+E(p 2)=2 E(p 1)=8 / 9$</text>
<explanation>The solver extends the expected value calculation to the three-player scenario by recognizing that the expected score against two opponents is the sum of the expected scores against each individual opponent. This shows sophisticated understanding of linearity of expectation.</explanation>

<text>Short version: third player doesn't matter; against 1 opponent, by symmetry, you'd both play the same strategy.</text>
<explanation>The solver immediately simplifies the three-player game by recognizing that it can be analyzed as a collection of pairwise comparisons. This strategic simplification allows them to focus on the core strategic interaction without getting lost in the full complexity of a three-player game.</explanation>

<start>600</start>
<end>683</end>
<text>Against 2 players, your EV is just $E(p 1)+E(p 2)=2 E(p 1)=8 / 9$</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that the expected score against two players can be calculated as the sum of expected scores against each individual player. This simplifies the calculation significantly by applying the principle of linearity of expectation, rather than analyzing all possible three-player scenarios.</explanation>

<text>Type A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A all with probability $5 / 9$.</text>
<explanation>The solver identifies the cyclic dominance pattern among the three die types, similar to a rock-paper-scissors dynamic. This pattern recognition is crucial for determining the optimal mixed strategy in the game.</explanation>

<start>197</start>
<end>293</end>
<text>It can be determined that choosing each die with probability $1 / 3$ is the best strategy.</text>
<explanation>The solver recognizes that the symmetric nature of the game (with each die having equal winning probability against one die and equal losing probability against another) leads to the balanced mixed strategy. This demonstrates pattern recognition in game structures.</explanation>
