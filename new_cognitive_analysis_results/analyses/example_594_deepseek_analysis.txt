Problem:
One hundred concentric circles with radii $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100$ are drawn in a plane. The interior of the circle of radius 1 is colored red, and each region bounded by consecutive circles is colored either red or green, with no two adjacent regions the same color. The ratio of the total area of the green regions to the area of the circle of radius 100 can be expressed as $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n.$

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so we have 100 concentric circles with radii from 1 up to 100. The innermost circle (radius 1) is colored red. Then, each annular region between consecutive circles can be colored either red or green, but no two adjacent regions can have the same color. We need to find the ratio of the total green area to the area of the largest circle (radius 100), and express that as a simplified fraction m/n, then find m + n.

First, let me visualize this. Concentric circles, so each circle shares the same center, and they are spaced 1 unit apart in radius. The regions between them (annuli) are either red or green, alternating colors so that two adjacent regions can't be the same. The innermost region (circle of radius 1) is red, so the next annulus (between radius 1 and 2) must be green, then the next (2 to 3) red, and so on, alternating. So maybe it's like a target pattern with alternating red and green rings, starting with red in the center.

Wait, but the problem says "each region bounded by consecutive circles is colored either red or green, with no two adjacent regions the same color". So, exactly like that: alternating colors. Since the first region (radius 1) is red, then regions 1-2 must be green, 2-3 red, 3-4 green, etc. So the color alternates starting from red. Thus, odd-numbered regions (1, 3, 5,...) would be red, even-numbered regions (2,4,6,...) would be green? But wait, the regions are between consecutive circles. The interior of radius 1 is the first region, then between 1-2, 2-3,...,99-100. So the regions are 100 in total? Wait: radius 1 is a circle; the regions are from 0-1, 1-2, up to 99-100. But I think the first region (radius 1) is considered the interior, which is red. But maybe the counting here is a bit different.

Wait. If the circle of radius 1 is entirely red. Then, each subsequent annulus is the area between two consecutive circles. Wait, so circles are at radii 1,2,...,100, so the regions would be:

1. 0 to 1 (radius 1 circle) - red

2. 1 to 2 (annulus) - next region, must be green

3. 2 to 3 - must be red

...

So you end up with alternated red and green regions. So even annular regions (the even rings: 1-2, 3-4, ..., up to 99-100 if that were what's even) Wait no, actually the regions are 1st: 0-1, 2nd:1-2,..., 100th:99-100. However, starting with the first region (red), then each subsequent is green, red, etc.

Therefore:

Region 1 (Radius 0-1): red

Region 2 (1-2): green

Region 3 (2-3): red

Region 4 (3-4): green

...

Up until region 100 (99-100): color depends on parity.

Since the first region (interior) is red, then every odd-numbered region is red, and even-numbered regions are green.

Wait, regions go from 1 to 100 because there's 100 circles?

Wait, if we have 100 circles with radii 1,2,...,100, then each pair of consecutive circles defines an annulus. How many annuli? The number of annuli between n circles is n-1. But here, they mentioned 100 concentric circles with radii 1,2,...,100. So the number of regions (annuli) would be 99. But wait hmmm:

Wait, initially, the interior of radius 1 is colored red. So that's sort of the first region. Then between 1-2 is the second region. Then 2-3 third, etc., up to 99-100. So to the extent that they are bounded by consecutive circles, starting from 1 up to 100. So if you have radii at 1,2,...,100, then the regions are:

1. Inside radius 1: red

2. Between 1 and 2: ?

3. Between 2 and 3: ? and so on.

But how many total regions? From inside radius 1, there's 99 more regions (from 1 to 100). So total regions: 1 (inside 1) + 99 annuli between 1-2 up to 99-100, total 100 regions. So 100 regions. The problem states that the interior of the circle with radius 1 is red, then each region bounded by consecutive circles is colored red or green, no two adjacent same color.

So regions 1 through 100: First region (interior 0-1) is red. Then, the annular regions 1-2, 2-3, ..., 99-100 are 99 regions? Wait, this is confusing.

Wait... Let me clarify.

Let me rephrase: There are 100 concentric circles with radii 1, 2, 3, ..., 100.

- The interior of the circle of radius 1 (i.e., the disk of radius 1) is colored red. So the region from 0 to 1 is red.

- Each region bounded by consecutive circles (i.e., the annulus between r = k and r = k+1 for k from 1 to 99) are colored either red or green, such that no two adjacent regions have the same color.

So the disk is divided into 100 regions:

1. 0-1: red.

2. 1-2: next region, must be different from red, so green.

3. 2-3: different from green, red.

4. 3-4: green.

...

Continuing this way, we alternate colors: starting with red, then green, red, etc. So all the odd-numbered regions (assuming disk 0-1 is region 1, 1-2 as region 2, ..., 99-100 as region 100) will have color red, green, red, ..., making the even regions green and the odd regions red? Wait: 0-1 is red (region 1), 1-2 (region 2) is green, 2-3 (region3) red, etc. So region number k is red if k is odd, green if k is even. Thus, since there are 100 regions, regions 1,3,5,...,99 are red (interior 0-1, 2-3, 4-5,...98-99), regions 2,4,6,...,100 are green (1-2,3-4,...,99-100). So the colors alternate starting with red.

Therefore, to find the ratio of the green areas to the area of the biggest circle (radius 100). First, let's calculate the area of the green regions. There are 50 green regions (since 100 regions alternating starting with red: green occurs in regions 2,4,...,100, which is 50 regions).

Each green region is an annulus. For each even k from 2 to 100 (step 2), green regions are the annuli between radius k-1 and k where k is even. Wait, actually, need to perhaps re-examine that.

Wait, the green regions are those between circles of radii from 1-2, 3-4, ..., 99-100 (regions 2,4,...,100). Each annulus between radius n-1 and n is a region? Wait, actually, no. The first region is 0-1 (red). Then each subsequent annulus is between k-1 and k for k from 2 to 100. So regions:

1: radius 0-1

2: radius 1-2

3: radius 2-3

...

100: radius 99-100

Therefore, each annulus between k-1 and k is region k. So green regions are even-numbered regions, which is the annulus between 1-2, 3-4, 5-6,...,99-100. Wait no, between odd and even. Wait, original regions, each region k is between (k-1) and k. For k ≥ 1: radius k-1 to k.

But in the problem statement, the first red region is the interior of radius 1, which is 0-1.

Then the annulus between 1-2 must be green, 2-3 red, 3-4 green, ..., 99-100 is green if 99 is odd, as 99-100 is region 100. Wait, the coloring is such that starting from red (region1:0-1), alternate. So green, red, green,... So regions even-numbered will be green. Therefore, annuli between 1-2, 3-4, 5-6,...,99-100? Wait, not exactly. Because the regions are:

- Region1 (0-1): red

- Region2 (1-2): green

- Region3 (2-3): red

- Region4 (3-4): green

- ...

Hence, the green regions are Region2 (1-2), Region4 (3-4), ..., Region100 (99-100). So total 50 green regions. Each green annulus is between radius (k-1) and k where k is even. Ok, so the green annuli have outer radius k and inner radius k-1, where k is 2,4,6,...,100, so k=2,4,...,100 (50 terms). The area of each green annulus is π( k2 - (k-1)^2 ) = π(2k -1). Then, the total green area is sum_{m=1 to 50} π(2*(2m) - 1) ) = wait, let's do that step-by-step.

Wait, for each green annulus between k-1 and k, where k is even: 2,4,6,...,100.

Each green annulus area is π*(k2 - (k-1)^2) = π*(2k -1). Hence, for each such k:

Total green area = π * sum_{k=2,4,...,100} (2k -1)

Similarly, the area of the circle with radius 100 is π*1002 = 10000π.

Therefore, the ratio greenArea / circleArea = [sum_{k=2,4,...,100} (2k -1)] / 10000

Now, compute this sum. Let's first handle the sum sum_{k even from 2 to 100} (2k -1). Let's denote the sum variables first.

Let k = 2m where m runs from 1 to 50 (since 2*50=100). Then:

Sum_{m=1 to 50} (2*(2m) -1 ) = Sum_{m=1 to 50} (4m -1) = 4*Sum(m) - Sum(1) = 4*(50*51)/2 - 50 = 4*(1275) -50 = 5100 -50 = 5050

Therefore, the total green area is π*5050, and the ratio is (5050π)/(10000π) = 5050/10000 = 505/1000 = 101/200 in reduced terms? Wait, divide numerator and denominator by 5: 505 ÷5=101, 1000÷5=200. So 101 and 200 coprime? 101 is a prime number. 200=2^3*5^2. No common factors with 101, so yes, 101/200.

Therefore, the ratio is 101/200, so m=101, n=200, so m + n = 301.

Wait, did I do that correctly?

Let me verify the sum again. When k is 2,4,...,100, so steps in 2’s. So when k=2m, m=1 to 50.

So substituting into 2k -1, that gives 2*(2m) -1 =4m -1. Hence, the sum over m=1 to 50 of 4m -1.

Sum 4m over 1 to 50: 4* sum(m from 1 to50)=4*(50*51)/2=4*1275=5100

Sum (-1) over 1 to50: -50.

Total sum: 5100 -50=5050. That’s correct.

Hence total green area is 5050π. Area of circle is 10000π. Thus 5050/10000=505/1000=101/200 after dividing numerator and denominator by 5. 101 and 200 coprime. So answer is 101+200=301. Seems correct.

But let me check with the regions again. Each green annulus is k even.

Wait, if regionk is green for k even. Let's take an example with smaller number. If there are two regions: radius 0->1 (red), radius1->2 (green). Then, if there's 2 circles (radius1 and radius2), creating two regions. Total green area would be area between 1-2, which is π(4 -1)=3π. The circle of radius 2 is 4π. So ratio is 3π/4π=3/4. But in this problem's approach, 2 green regions but wait:

Wait hold on. Wait, in this problem, the formula gives for upper radius N=2: green is regions k even. For N=2, the circles are radius 1 and 2, but regions are 0-1 (red), and 1-2 (green). So the formula would give sum over green regions which is k=2 (since k even 2):

sum (2*2 -1)=3, so the ratio is 3/ (2^2)=3/4 which is correct, so the formula works for N=2.

Testing another example. Take N=3: 3 circles, so radius1,2,3. Regions:

0-1:red, 1-2:green, 2-3:red. So green area is region 2 (1-2) area π*(4-1)=3π. Area circle radius3 is9π. ratio 3/9=1/3. Using the formula:

(Sum_{m=1 to floor(3/2)} (4m -1))/9 = When N=3, green regions where k=2 (since m=1), sum= (4*1 -1) =3. Thus 3/9=1/3, which matches. So correct. If circles= 4.

For N=4: regions:

0-1:red,

1-2:green,

2-3:red,

3-4:green.

Green areas: regions2 (1-2) and4 (3-4). Areas: pi*(4-1) + pi*(16 -9)=3pi +7pi=10pi. Area ratio 10pi/(16pi)=10/16=5/8. When via formula:

N=4. Sum formula for green regions: sum over m=1 to 2 of (4m -1)= (4*1 -1)+(4*2 -1)= 3 +7=10. 10/16=5/8. Correct.

Yes, correct. Therefore, seems that formula holds. Then, extending to N=100:

Sum gives 5050. Thus 5050/10000=101/200, so m + n=301. So this is answer. But let me see, the problem states "the ratio of the total area of the green regions to the area of the circle of radius 100", so yes. So unless I miscalculated sum.

But from examples above, calculations hold, confirms the formula. So answer should be 101 +200=301.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{301}

<text>Let k = 2m where m runs from 1 to 50 (since 2*50=100). Then:
Sum_{m=1 to 50} (2*(2m) -1 ) = Sum_{m=1 to 50} (4m -1) = 4*Sum(m) - Sum(1) = 4*(50*51)/2 - 50 = 4*(1275) -50 = 5100 -50 = 5050</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates algebraic manipulation by reindexing the sum using a substitution (k=2m), expanding the expression, and then applying the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers to calculate the total.</explanation>

<text>Therefore, the total green area is π*5050, and the ratio is (5050π)/(10000π) = 5050/10000 = 505/1000 = 101/200 in reduced terms? Wait, divide numerator and denominator by 5: 505 ÷5=101, 1000÷5=200.</text>

Let me verify the sum again. When k is 2,4,...,100, so steps in 2's. So when k=2m, m=1 to 50.</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates self-monitoring by questioning their own calculation and deciding to verify the sum again, showing awareness of the possibility of errors and taking steps to check their work.</explanation>

<text>Then, if there's 2 circles (radius1 and radius2), creating two regions. Total green area would be area between 1-2, which is π(4 -1)=3π. The circle of radius 2 is 4π. So ratio is 3π/4π=3/4. But in this problem's approach, 2 green regions but wait:
Wait hold on. Wait, in this problem, the formula gives for upper radius N=2: green is regions k even. For N=2, the circles are radius 1 and 2, but regions are 0-1 (red), and 1-2 (green). So the formula would give sum over green regions which is k=2 (since k even 2):
sum (2*2 -1)=3, so the ratio is 3/ (2^2)=3/4 which is correct, so the formula works for N=2.</text>
<explanation>The solver tests their formula with a simple case (N=2) to verify that it produces the expected result, calculating both the direct geometric approach and using their derived formula to confirm they match.</explanation>

<text>Testing another example. Take N=3: 3 circles, so radius1,2,3. Regions:

(Sum_{m=1 to floor(3/2)} (4m -1))/9 = When N=3, green regions where k=2 (since m=1), sum= (4*1 -1) =3. Thus 3/9=1/3, which matches. So correct. If circles= 4.</text>

<text>So 101 and 200 coprime? 101 is a prime number. 200=2^3*5^2. No common factors with 101, so yes, 101/200.
Therefore, the ratio is 101/200, so m=101, n=200, so m + n = 301.</text>
