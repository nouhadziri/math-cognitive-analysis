Problem:
Andile and Zandre play a game on a  $2017 \times 2017$  board. At the beginning, Andile declares some of the squares *forbidden*, meaning the nothing may be placed on such a square. After that, they take turns to place coins on the board, with Zandre placing the first coin. It is not allowed to place a coin on a forbidden square or in the same row or column where another coin has already been placed. The player who places the last coin wins the game.

What is the least number of squares Andile needs to declare as forbidden at the beginning to ensure a win? (Assume that both players use an optimal strategy.)

Domain: Geometry

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Initial Setup and Strategy**:
   - Andile and Zandre play on a \(2017 \times 2017\) board.
   - Andile declares some squares as forbidden.
   - Zandre places the first coin, and they alternate turns.
   - Coins cannot be placed on forbidden squares or in the same row or column as another coin.
   - The player who places the last coin wins.

2. **Optimal Strategy for Andile**:
   - To ensure a win, Andile needs to declare a certain number of squares as forbidden.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of forbidden squares while ensuring Andile's victory.

3. **Declaring an Entire Row Forbidden**:
   - If Andile declares an entire row forbidden, there are \(2016\) rows and \(2017\) columns left.
   - Each move reduces the number of available rows and columns by 1.
   - Since there are more columns than rows, the game ends when the rows are exhausted.
   - With \(2016\) rows (an even number), Andile wins because Zandre will place the last coin in the last column, leaving Andile to place the last coin in the last row.

4. **Proving \(2016\) Forbidden Squares are Not Enough**:
   - Consider the game on a \((2n+1) \times (2n+1)\) board.
   - **Claim**: If at most \(2n\) squares are forbidden, Zandre wins.
   - **Base Case**: For \(n=0\), the board is \(1 \times 1\) with no forbidden squares, and Zandre wins by placing the only coin.
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume the claim holds for \(k\). Consider a \((2k+1) \times (2k+1)\) board with at most \(2k\) forbidden squares.
     - If there is at most one forbidden square, Zandre can choose a square in its row.
     - If two forbidden squares are in the same row or column, Zandre chooses a non-forbidden square in that row or column.
     - If two forbidden squares \(X\) and \(Y\) are in different rows and columns, Zandre chooses a square \(Z\) in the same row as \(X\) and the same column as \(Y\).
     - After Zandre's move, Andile is left with at most \(2k-2\) forbidden squares on a \((2k-1) \times (2k-1)\) board.
   - By induction, Zandre wins if at most \(2k\) squares are forbidden.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Andile needs to declare at least \(2017\) squares as forbidden to ensure a win.
   - Declaring an entire row forbidden (2017 squares) ensures Andile's victory.

The final answer is \(\boxed{2017}\).
