Problem:
Each lattice point with nonnegative coordinates is labeled with a nonnegative integer in such a way that the point $(0,0)$ is labeled by 0 , and for every $x, y \geq 0$, the set of numbers labeled on the points $(x, y),(x, y+1)$, and $(x+1, y)$ is \{n, n+1, n+2\} for some nonnegative integer $n$. Determine, with proof, all possible labels for the point $(2000,2024)$.

Domain: Combinatorics

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the possible labels for the point $(2000, 2024)$ in a labeled lattice of nonnegative coordinates, where the labeling satisfies certain conditions. Let the label of the point $(x, y)$ be denoted by $L(x, y)$.

The given conditions are:
1. $L(x, y) \geq 0$ for all $x, y \geq 0$.
2. $L(0, 0) = 0$.
3. For every $x, y \geq 0$, the set of numbers $\{L(x, y), L(x, y+1), L(x+1, y)\}$ is equal to $\{n, n+1, n+2\}$ for some nonnegative integer $n$.

Consider the implications of the third condition. The labels of three adjacent points form a set of three consecutive integers.

Let's explore the labels of some initial points.
- For $(x, y) = (0, 0)$, the set $\{L(0, 0), L(0, 1), L(1, 0)\} = \{0, L(0, 1), L(1, 0)\}$ must be of the form $\{n, n+1, n+2\}$. Since $L(0, 0) = 0$, we have $\{0, L(0, 1), L(1, 0)\} = \{0, 1, 2\}$.
  - Case 1: $L(0, 1) = 1, L(1, 0) = 2$.
  - Case 2: $L(0, 1) = 2, L(1, 0) = 1$.

Case 1: $L(0, 0) = 0, L(0, 1) = 1, L(1, 0) = 2$.

Now consider the point $(0, 1)$. The set $\{L(0, 1), L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{1, L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\}$ must be of the form $\{n, n+1, n+2\}$.
Since $1$ is in the set, we have possibilities $\{0, 1, 2\}$ or $\{1, 2, 3\}$ or $\{...\}$
The set is $\{L(0, 1), L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{1, L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\}$.
If the set is $\{0, 1, 2\}$, then $\{L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{0, 2\}$.
  - Subcase 1.1: $L(0, 2) = 0, L(1, 1) = 2$.
  - Subcase 1.2: $L(0, 2) = 2, L(1, 1) = 0$.
If the set is $\{1, 2, 3\}$, then $\{L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{2, 3\}$.
  - Subcase 1.3: $L(0, 2) = 2, L(1, 1) = 3$.
  - Subcase 1.4: $L(0, 2) = 3, L(1, 1) = 2$.

Let's consider the structure of the labels.
Consider the differences between labels of adjacent points.
From the condition, the differences $|L(x, y+1) - L(x, y)|$, $|L(x+1, y) - L(x, y)|$, $|L(x+1, y) - L(x, y+1)|$ are $1$.

Consider the grid and the movement from one point to an adjacent one.
Moving from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y+1)$ changes the label by $\pm 1$.
Moving from $(x, y)$ to $(x+1, y)$ changes the label by $\pm 1$.

Let $d_y(x, y) = L(x, y+1) - L(x, y) = \pm 1$.
Let $d_x(x, y) = L(x+1, y) - L(x, y) = \pm 1$.

Consider the cycle around a unit square: $(x, y) \to (x+1, y) \to (x+1, y+1) \to (x, y+1) \to (x, y)$.
$L(x+1, y+1) - L(x, y+1) = \pm 1$.
$L(x+1, y+1) - L(x+1, y) = \pm 1$.

We have $\{L(x, y), L(x, y+1), L(x+1, y)\} = \{n, n+1, n+2\}$.
This implies that the labels of these three points are distinct.

Consider the signs of $d_x$ and $d_y$.
$L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) \pm 1$.
$L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) \pm 1$.

Possibilities for $\{L(x, y), L(x, y+1), L(x+1, y)\}$:
If $L(x, y) = n$, then $\{n, n+1, n+2\}$.
- $L(x, y+1) = n+1, L(x+1, y) = n+2$ or $L(x, y+1) = n+2, L(x+1, y) = n+1$.

Case A: $L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) + 1$, $L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) + 2$.
  Then $L(x+1, y) - L(x, y+1) = 1$.

Case B: $L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) + 2$, $L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) + 1$.
  Then $L(x+1, y) - L(x, y+1) = -1$.

Case C: $L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) - 1$, $L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) + 1$.
  This requires $n \geq 1$.

Case D: $L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) + 1$, $L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) - 1$.
  This requires $n \geq 1$.

Let's use the initial conditions. $L(0, 0) = 0$.
$\{L(0, 0), L(0, 1), L(1, 0)\} = \{0, L(0, 1), L(1, 0)\} = \{0, 1, 2\}$.

Possibility 1: $L(0, 1) = 1, L(1, 0) = 2$.
Possibility 2: $L(0, 1) = 2, L(1, 0) = 1$.

Consider Possibility 1: $L(0, 0) = 0, L(0, 1) = 1, L(1, 0) = 2$.
Consider the point $(0, 1)$. $\{L(0, 1), L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{1, L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{n, n+1, n+2\}$.
Since $1$ is in the set, the set is $\{0, 1, 2\}$ or $\{1, 2, 3\}$.

If $\{1, L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{0, 1, 2\}$, then $\{L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{0, 2\}$.
  - Subcase 1.1: $L(0, 2) = 0, L(1, 1) = 2$.
  - Subcase 1.2: $L(0, 2) = 2, L(1, 1) = 0$.

If $\{1, L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{1, 2, 3\}$, then $\{L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{2, 3\}$.
  - Subcase 1.3: $L(0, 2) = 2, L(1, 1) = 3$.
  - Subcase 1.4: $L(0, 2) = 3, L(1, 1) = 2$.

Consider Subcase 1.1: $L(0, 2) = 0, L(1, 1) = 2$.
Labels so far: $L(0, 0) = 0, L(0, 1) = 1, L(1, 0) = 2, L(0, 2) = 0, L(1, 1) = 2$.

Consider the point $(1, 0)$. $\{L(1, 0), L(1, 1), L(2, 0)\} = \{2, 2, L(2, 0)\}$. This is not a set of three distinct consecutive integers. So Subcase 1.1 is impossible.

Consider Subcase 1.2: $L(0, 2) = 2, L(1, 1) = 0$.
Labels so far: $L(0, 0) = 0, L(0, 1) = 1, L(1, 0) = 2, L(0, 2) = 2, L(1, 1) = 0$.

Consider the point $(1, 0)$. $\{L(1, 0), L(1, 1), L(2, 0)\} = \{2, 0, L(2, 0)\} = \{n, n+1, n+2\}$.
This requires $\{0, 2, L(2, 0)\} = \{0, 1, 2\}$ or $\{1, 2, 3\}$.
If $\{0, 2, L(2, 0)\} = \{0, 1, 2\}$, then $L(2, 0) = 1$.
If $\{0, 2, L(2, 0)\} = \{1, 2, 3\}$, impossible since $0$ is not in the set.
So, $L(2, 0) = 1$.

Consider Subcase 1.3: $L(0, 2) = 2, L(1, 1) = 3$.
Labels so far: $L(0, 0) = 0, L(0, 1) = 1, L(1, 0) = 2, L(0, 2) = 2, L(1, 1) = 3$.

Consider the point $(1, 0)$. $\{L(1, 0), L(1, 1), L(2, 0)\} = \{2, 3, L(2, 0)\} = \{n, n+1, n+2\}$.
This requires $\{2, 3, L(2, 0)\} = \{1, 2, 3\}$ or $\{2, 3, 4\}$.
If $\{2, 3, L(2, 0)\} = \{1, 2, 3\}$, then $L(2, 0) = 1$.
If $\{2, 3, L(2, 0)\} = \{2, 3, 4\}$, then $L(2, 0) = 4$.

Consider Subcase 1.4: $L(0, 2) = 3, L(1, 1) = 2$.
Labels so far: $L(0, 0) = 0, L(0, 1) = 1, L(1, 0) = 2, L(0, 2) = 3, L(1, 1) = 2$.

Consider the point $(1, 0)$. $\{L(1, 0), L(1, 1), L(2, 0)\} = \{2, 2, L(2, 0)\}$. Impossible.

Let's go back to the two initial possibilities.

Possibility 1: $L(0, 0) = 0, L(0, 1) = 1, L(1, 0) = 2$.
Possibility 2: $L(0, 0) = 0, L(0, 1) = 2, L(1, 0) = 1$.

Consider Possibility 1 again.
Consider the point $(0, 1)$. $\{L(0, 1), L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{1, L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\}$.
Possibilities for the set: $\{0, 1, 2\}$ or $\{1, 2, 3\}$.

If $\{0, 1, 2\}$, then $\{L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{0, 2\}$.
  - $L(0, 2) = 0, L(1, 1) = 2$.
  - $L(0, 2) = 2, L(1, 1) = 0$.

If $\{1, 2, 3\}$, then $\{L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{2, 3\}$.
  - $L(0, 2) = 2, L(1, 1) = 3$.
  - $L(0, 2) = 3, L(1, 1) = 2$.

Consider Possibility 2: $L(0, 0) = 0, L(0, 1) = 2, L(1, 0) = 1$.
Consider the point $(0, 1)$. $\{L(0, 1), L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{2, L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\}$.
Possibilities for the set: $\{0, 1, 2\}$ or $\{1, 2, 3\}$ or $\{2, 3, 4\}$.

If $\{0, 1, 2\}$, then $\{L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{0, 1\}$.
  - $L(0, 2) = 0, L(1, 1) = 1$.
  - $L(0, 2) = 1, L(1, 1) = 0$.

If $\{1, 2, 3\}$, then $\{L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{1, 3\}$.
  - $L(0, 2) = 1, L(1, 1) = 3$.
  - $L(0, 2) = 3, L(1, 1) = 1$.

If $\{2, 3, 4\}$, then $\{L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{3, 4\}$.
  - $L(0, 2) = 3, L(1, 1) = 4$.
  - $L(0, 2) = 4, L(1, 1) = 3$.

Let's assume a form for the label $L(x, y)$.
Consider $L(x, y) = ax + by$.
$L(0, 0) = 0$.
$\{ax, a(y+1), bx+y\} = \{n, n+1, n+2\}$? No.

Consider $L(x, y) = x+y$.
$\{x+y, x+y+1, x+1+y\} = \{x+y, x+y+1, x+y+1\}$. Not distinct.

Consider $L(x, y) = |x-y|$.
$\{ |x-y|, |x-y-1|, |x+1-y| \}$.

Let's revisit the structure of the differences.
$L(x, y+1) - L(x, y) = \pm 1$.
$L(x+1, y) - L(x, y) = \pm 1$.

Consider the parity of the labels.
$L(x, y+1)$ has opposite parity to $L(x, y)$.
$L(x+1, y)$ has opposite parity to $L(x, y)$.
So, $L(x, y+1)$ and $L(x+1, y)$ have the same parity.

From $\{L(x, y), L(x, y+1), L(x+1, y)\} = \{n, n+1, n+2\}$, the labels have different parities.
This implies $L(x, y)$ has a different parity from $L(x, y+1)$ and $L(x+1, y)$.
So, $L(x, y+1)$ and $L(x+1, y)$ differ by $2$.

Possibility 1: $L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) + 1, L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) + 2$.
Possibility 2: $L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) + 2, L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) + 1$.
Possibility 3: $L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) - 1, L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) + 1$.
Possibility 4: $L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) + 1, L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) - 1$.

Consider the initial conditions. $L(0, 0) = 0$.
$\{L(0, 0), L(0, 1), L(1, 0)\} = \{0, L(0, 1), L(1, 0)\} = \{0, 1, 2\}$.

Possibility 1: $L(0, 1) = 1, L(1, 0) = 2$. Corresponds to Possibility 1 above.
Possibility 2: $L(0, 1) = 2, L(1, 0) = 1$. Corresponds to Possibility 2 above.

Case 1: $L(0, 0) = 0, L(0, 1) = 1, L(1, 0) = 2$.
For $(0, 0)$, we have $L(0, 1) = L(0, 0) + 1$, $L(1, 0) = L(0, 0) + 2$. Matches form 1.
Assume this pattern holds everywhere.
$L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) + 1$.
$L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) + 2$.

$L(1, 1) = L(1, 0) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.
$L(1, 1) = L(0, 1) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3$. Consistent.

$L(x, y) = ax + by$. Not working.

Let $L(x, y) = ax + by$.
$a(0) + b(1) = 1 \implies b = 1$.
$a(1) + b(0) = 2 \implies a = 2$.
So $L(x, y) = 2x + y$.
Check: $L(0, 0) = 0$.
$\{L(x, y), L(x, y+1), L(x+1, y)\} = \{2x+y, 2x+y+1, 2(x+1)+y\} = \{2x+y, 2x+y+1, 2x+y+2\}$.
This is of the form $\{n, n+1, n+2\}$ with $n = 2x+y$.
So, $L(x, y) = 2x + y$ is a valid labeling.

Case 2: $L(0, 0) = 0, L(0, 1) = 2, L(1, 0) = 1$.
For $(0, 0)$, we have $L(0, 1) = L(0, 0) + 2$, $L(1, 0) = L(0, 0) + 1$. Matches form 2.
Assume this pattern holds everywhere.
$L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) + 2$.
$L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) + 1$.

$L(1, 1) = L(1, 0) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3$.
$L(1, 1) = L(0, 1) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$. Consistent.

Let $L(x, y) = ax + by$.
$a(0) + b(1) = 2 \implies b = 2$.
$a(1) + b(0) = 1 \implies a = 1$.
So $L(x, y) = x + 2y$.
Check: $L(0, 0) = 0$.
$\{L(x, y), L(x, y+1), L(x+1, y)\} = \{x+2y, x+2(y+1), (x+1)+2y\} = \{x+2y, x+2y+2, x+2y+1\}$.
This is of the form $\{n, n+1, n+2\}$ with $n = x+2y$.
So, $L(x, y) = x + 2y$ is another valid labeling.

The possible labels are $L(x, y) = 2x + y$ and $L(x, y) = x + 2y$.

For $(2000, 2024)$, the labels are:
$L(2000, 2024) = 2(2000) + 2024 = 4000 + 2024 = 6024$.
$L(2000, 2024) = 2000 + 2(2024) = 2000 + 4048 = 6048$.

The possible labels for $(2000, 2024)$ are $6024$ and $6048$.

Proof that these are the only possibilities.
Consider the differences $d_y(x, y) = L(x, y+1) - L(x, y)$ and $d_x(x, y) = L(x+1, y) - L(x, y)$.
We have $|d_y| = 1, |d_x| = 1$.
The set $\{L(x, y), L(x, y)+d_y, L(x, y)+d_x\}$ is a set of three consecutive integers.
This implies $d_y \neq d_x$.
So, $\{d_y, d_x\} = \{1, 2\}$ or $\{-1, -2\}$ or $\{1, -1\}$ etc.

From the parity argument, $L(x, y+1)$ and $L(x+1, y)$ have the same parity.
If $L(x, y)$ is even, then $L(x, y+1)$ and $L(x+1, y)$ are odd.
If $L(x, y)$ is odd, then $L(x, y+1)$ and $L(x+1, y)$ are even.
So, $L(x, y+1) - L(x+1, y)$ is even, so $L(x, y+1) - L(x+1, y) = 0, \pm 2, ...$

Consider the cycle around a unit square.
$L(x+1, y+1) - L(x, y+1) = \pm 1$.
$L(x+1, y+1) - L(x+1, y) = \pm 1$.

$L(x+1, y+1) = L(x, y+1) \pm 1 = L(x, y) + d_y \pm 1$.
$L(x+1, y+1) = L(x+1, y) \pm 1 = L(x, y) + d_x \pm 1$.

So, $d_y \pm 1 = d_x \pm 1$.
If $d_y + 1 = d_x + 1$, then $d_y = d_x$, contradiction.
If $d_y - 1 = d_x - 1$, then $d_y = d_x$, contradiction.
If $d_y + 1 = d_x - 1$, then $d_x - d_y = 2$.
If $d_y - 1 = d_x + 1$, then $d_y - d_x = 2$.

Case 1: $d_x - d_y = 2$.
  If $d_y = -1$, $d_x = 1$. $L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) - 1, L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) + 1$.
  If $d_y = 1$, $d_x = 3$, impossible.

Case 2: $d_y - d_x = 2$.
  If $d_x = -1$, $d_y = 1$. $L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) + 1, L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) - 1$.
  If $d_x = 1$, $d_y = 3$, impossible.

So, we have two fundamental patterns:
Pattern 1: $L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) - 1$, $L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) + 1$.
Pattern 2: $L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) + 1$, $L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) - 1$.

Consider the initial condition $\{0, L(0, 1), L(1, 0)\} = \{0, 1, 2\}$.
Pattern 1 at $(0, 0)$: $L(0, 1) = L(0, 0) - 1 = -1$, not nonnegative.
Pattern 2 at $(0, 0)$: $L(0, 1) = L(0, 0) + 1 = 1$, $L(1, 0) = L(0, 0) - 1 = -1$, not nonnegative.

The assumption that the differences are constant is wrong.

<definition>The process of drawing conclusions based on premises and rules of inference, moving from given information to necessary consequences through valid reasoning steps.</definition>

<end>2287</end>
<text>From the parity argument, $L(x, y+1)$ and $L(x+1, y)$ have the same parity.
If $L(x, y)$ is even, then $L(x, y+1)$ and $L(x+1, y)$ are odd.
If $L(x, y)$ is odd, then $L(x, y+1)$ and $L(x+1, y)$ are even.</text>
<explanation>The solver uses logical deduction to analyze the parity constraints on adjacent cells, deriving necessary properties of the labeling function based on the requirement that three adjacent points must have consecutive integer values.</explanation>

<start>2288</start>
<end>2386</end>
<text>So, $L(x, y+1) - L(x+1, y)$ is even, so $L(x, y+1) - L(x+1, y) = 0, \pm 2, ...$</text>
<explanation>The solver deduces a key constraint about the difference between labels at specific positions, using the previously established parity relationships to narrow down the possible relationships between adjacent labels.</explanation>

<start>2387</start>
<end>2488</end>
<text>Consider the cycle around a unit square.
$L(x+1, y+1) - L(x, y+1) = \pm 1$.
$L(x+1, y+1) - L(x+1, y) = \pm 1$.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies logical deduction to analyze the constraints around a unit square in the grid, deriving necessary relationships between the labels at different positions based on the problem conditions.</explanation>

<skill>Constraint Analysis</skill>
<definition>The ability to identify, interpret, and work with the constraints of a problem, determining how they limit the solution space and guide the problem-solving approach.</definition>

<start>65</start>
<end>148</end>
<text>The given conditions are:
1. $L(x, y) \geq 0$ for all $x, y \geq 0$.
2. $L(0, 0) = 0$.
3. For every $x, y \geq 0$, the set of numbers $\{L(x, y), L(x, y+1), L(x+1, y)\}$ is equal to $\{n, n+1, n+2\}$ for some nonnegative integer $n$.</text>
<explanation>The solver clearly identifies and articulates the key constraints of the problem, which forms the foundation for their subsequent analysis and problem-solving approach.</explanation>

<start>575</start>
<end>677</end>
<text>Since $1$ is in the set, we have possibilities $\{0, 1, 2\}$ or $\{1, 2, 3\}$ or $\{...\}$
The set is $\{L(0, 1), L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\} = \{1, L(0, 2), L(1, 1)\}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes how the constraint of having three consecutive integers restricts the possible values for the unknown labels, given that one value (1) is already known.</explanation>

<start>2685</start>
<end>2862</end>
<text>Case 1: $d_x - d_y = 2$.
  If $d_y = -1$, $d_x = 1$. $L(x, y+1) = L(x, y) - 1, L(x+1, y) = L(x, y) + 1$.
  If $d_y = 1$, $d_x = 3$, impossible.</text>
<explanation>The solver analyzes how the constraints on differences between adjacent labels restrict the possible patterns, identifying valid and invalid combinations based on the problem conditions.</explanation>

<skill>Verification and Validation</skill>
<definition>The process of checking that a proposed solution or approach satisfies all the conditions of the problem, often by testing it against specific cases or general requirements.</definition>

<start>1253</start>
<end>1353</end>
<text>Consider $L(x, y) = 2x + y$.
Check: $L(0, 0) = 0$.
$\{L(x, y), L(x, y+1), L(x+1, y)\} = \{2x+y, 2x+y+1, 2(x+1)+y\}</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies their proposed solution by checking that it satisfies the initial condition L(0,0)=0 and then testing whether it produces the required pattern of three consecutive integers for adjacent points.</explanation>

<start>1735</start>
<end>1868</end>
<text>So $L(x, y) = x + 2y$.
Check: $L(0, 0) = 0$.
$\{L(x, y), L(x, y+1), L(x+1, y)\} = \{x+2y, x+2(y+1), (x+1)+2y\} = \{x+2y, x+2y+2, x+2y+1\}$.</text>
<explanation>The solver verifies their second proposed solution by checking that it satisfies the initial condition and produces the required pattern of consecutive integers, demonstrating thoroughness in validation.</explanation>

<start>1943</start>
<end>2071</end>
<text>For $(2000, 2024)$, the labels are:
$L(2000, 2024) = 2(2000) + 2024 = 4000 + 2024 = 6024$.
$L(2000, 2024) = 2000 + 2(2024) = 2000 + 4048 = 6048$.</text>
<explanation>The solver applies both validated labeling functions to the specific point asked for in the problem (2000,2024), computing the exact values that answer the original question.</explanation>
