Problem:
Consider the fission of $^{236}U$ into two equal mass prompt fission fragments and zero free neutrons. What is the value of proton number Z giving the most stable nucleus with the same mass number? What is the energy released by each fragment to reach that stable nucleus by a series of beta decay?

Answer Choices:
(A) Z=51, Energy= 20 MeV
(B) Z=47, Energy=5 MeV
(C) Z=50, Energy= 18 MeV
(D) Z=48, Energy= 16MeV

Domain: Calculus

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
The problem involves nuclear fission and beta decay.
First, we need to determine the mass number and proton number of the fission fragments.
The parent nucleus is $^{236}U$. The proton number of Uranium (U) is 92. The mass number is 236.
The fission produces two equal mass fragments and zero free neutrons.
Let the mass number of each fragment be A_f and the proton number be Z_f.
Since the mass number is conserved, 2 * A_f = 236, so A_f = 236 / 2 = 118.
Since the proton number is conserved, 2 * Z_f = 92, so Z_f = 92 / 2 = 46.
So the fission fragments have a mass number of 118 and a proton number of 46. This corresponds to Palladium (Pd).

Next, we need to find the most stable nucleus with the same mass number A = 118.
For a given mass number, the most stable nucleus has a proton number close to the value on the valley of stability. We can use the semi-empirical mass formula (or Bethe-Weizsäcker formula) to approximate the most stable Z.
Alternatively, we can use the approximation Z ≈ N/2 for light nuclei and Z ≈ N/1.5 for heavy nuclei. For A=118, it's an intermediate nucleus. We can use the empirical formula for the most stable isobaric nucleus:
Z_stable ≈ A / (1.98 + 0.015 A^(2/3))
Z_stable ≈ 118 / (1.98 + 0.015 * (118)^(2/3))
Z_stable ≈ 118 / (1.98 + 0.015 * (24.4))
Z_stable ≈ 118 / (1.98 + 0.366)
Z_stable ≈ 118 / 2.346
Z_stable ≈ 50.3

Looking at the answer choices, the closest integer value for the most stable Z is 50. This corresponds to Tin (Sn).

The fission fragment has Z_f = 46. The stable nucleus has Z_stable = 50.
The fragment needs to undergo beta decay to increase the proton number.
In β⁻ decay, a neutron converts into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino.
The mass number remains the same, and the proton number increases by 1.
To go from Z=46 to Z=50, there will be 50 - 46 = 4 beta decays.

Now we need to estimate the energy released during these beta decays.
The energy released in beta decay is related to the difference in binding energy between the initial and final nuclei. A more stable nucleus has a higher binding energy per nucleon.
We can use a rough estimate for the energy released per beta decay. Typically, the Q-value of a beta decay is a few MeV.

Alternatively, we can use the semi-empirical mass formula to estimate the mass difference between the fragment and the stable nucleus.
The energy released is approximately the difference in the binding energies. For isobars, the mass difference is mainly due to the Coulomb term and the symmetry term.
M(A, Z) = Constant + c_c Z^2 A^(-1/3) + c_sym (N-Z)^2 A^-1
The change in mass is approximately proportional to the difference in (Z^2) for the Coulomb term.
However, a simpler way is to use empirical values of beta decay energies.

We can estimate the energy released by considering the mass difference between the initial and final nuclei. The mass difference is converted into energy according to E=mc².
The mass difference between two isobars is approximately given by ΔM ≈ a (Z_1 - Z_2), where 'a' is a constant around a few MeV/c².
A rough estimation for the energy released per beta decay is around a few MeV. Since there are 4 beta decays, the total energy released would be a few times 4 MeV.

Let's consider the binding energy per nucleon curve. The binding energy per nucleon is maximum around A=60. For A=118, the slope is decreasing.
When a nucleus undergoes beta decay to reach a more stable state, the mass decreases, and this mass difference is released as energy.

Let's look at the answer choices.
If Z=50 is the stable nucleus, the number of beta decays is 50 - 46 = 4.
The energy released per beta decay is typically in the range of 1-10 MeV.
If the total energy released is around 16-20 MeV for 4 beta decays, it seems reasonable.

Consider the case where the most stable Z is 50. The initial fragment has Z=46.
The fragment will undergo β⁻ decay.
$^{118}_{46}Pd \rightarrow ^{118}_{47}Ag + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$
$^{118}_{47}Ag \rightarrow ^{118}_{48}Cd + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$
$^{118}_{48}Cd \rightarrow ^{118}_{49}In + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$
$^{118}_{49}In \rightarrow ^{118}_{50}Sn + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$

The energy released in each step is the Q-value of the decay. The total energy released is the sum of the Q-values.
The Q-value is related to the mass difference between the parent and daughter nuclei.
Q = (M_parent - M_daughter - m_e) c²

We can estimate the total energy released using the difference in the atomic mass excesses.
The mass excess is Δ = M - A.
The energy released is approximately related to the difference in binding energies.

Let's evaluate the answer choices.
If Z=51 is the most stable, then 51 - 46 = 5 beta decays. Energy = 20 MeV -> 4 MeV per decay (reasonable).
If Z=47 is the most stable, then 47 - 46 = 1 beta decay. Energy = 5 MeV (reasonable).
If Z=50 is the most stable, then 50 - 46 = 4 beta decays. Energy = 18 MeV -> 4.5 MeV per decay (reasonable).
If Z=48 is the most stable, then 48 - 46 = 2 beta decays. Energy = 16 MeV -> 8 MeV per decay (possible but higher end).

The most stable isobar for A=118 is likely to be around Z=50 based on the valley of stability.

Let's consider the semi-empirical mass formula for the energy difference between two isobars.
The difference in mass is dominated by the Coulomb and symmetry terms.
ΔE ≈ (B.E.)_stable - (B.E.)_fragment
For isobars, the mass parabola shows that the most stable nucleus is at the minimum.
The energy difference between two isobars with the same A is approximately given by:
ΔE ≈ a_C (Z_stable^2 - Z_fragment^2) / A^(1/3)  + a_sym ((A - 2Z_stable)^2 - (A - 2Z_fragment)^2) / A

Using Z_stable = 50 and Z_fragment = 46, A = 118.
a_C ≈ 0.7 MeV, a_sym ≈ 23 MeV.
ΔE_C ≈ 0.7 * (50^2 - 46^2) / (118)^(1/3) ≈ 0.7 * (2500 - 2116) / 4.9 ≈ 0.7 * 384 / 4.9 ≈ 55 MeV (This is too high, meaning this formula is for a larger difference)

Let's use the concept of the mass parabola. The energy difference is proportional to (Z - Z_min)^2.
The energy released in beta decay comes from the difference in nuclear binding energies.

Consider the binding energy per nucleon curve. The most stable nuclei are around Fe (A=56). As we move away, the binding energy per nucleon decreases. For isobars, the most stable one has the highest binding energy.

Let's revisit the empirical formula for Z_stable ≈ 50.3. The closest integer is 50.

If Z=50 is the most stable, the fragment needs to undergo 4 beta decays.
The energy released in each beta decay is related to the mass difference between the isobars.
We can use a rough estimate of a few MeV per beta decay.
If the total energy is around 18 MeV for 4 decays, that's about 4.5 MeV per decay, which is reasonable.

Consider the case where the stable nucleus is Z=50. The initial fragment has Z=46.
The Q-value for a beta decay is roughly a few MeV.
If the total energy released is 18 MeV for 4 decays, it's plausible.

If the most stable Z is 50, the decay chain is:
$^{118}_{46}Pd \rightarrow ^{118}_{47}Ag \rightarrow ^{118}_{48}Cd \rightarrow ^{118}_{49}In \rightarrow ^{118}_{50}Sn$

We can estimate the energy released using mass excesses.
Energy released = [M($^{118}_{46}Pd$) - M($^{118}_{50}Sn$)] c²
Energy released = [Δ($^{118}_{46}Pd$) - Δ($^{118}_{50}Sn$)] c²

Looking up mass excesses is difficult during an exam.

Let's use the fact that the energy released in beta decay is typically a few MeV.
If the transition is to Z=50 from Z=46, it's 4 beta decays. If each releases a few MeV, the total is around 10-20 MeV.

Option (C) Z=50, Energy= 18 MeV seems consistent with this estimation.

Let's double-check the other options.
(A) Z=51, Energy= 20 MeV. If Z=51 is stable, 5 beta decays, ~4 MeV/decay. Plausible.
(B) Z=47, Energy= 5 MeV. If Z=47 is stable, 1 beta decay, 5 MeV/decay. Plausible.
(D) Z=48, Energy= 16 MeV. If Z=48 is stable, 2 beta decays, 8 MeV/decay. Higher end.

The most stable isobar for A=118 is more likely to be closer to the empirical formula result of Z ≈ 50.

The question asks for the energy released by each fragment to reach the stable nucleus.
Each fragment has A=118, Z=46.

If the most stable Z is 50, the energy released is 18 MeV for the fragment.

Final check of the most stable Z for A=118.
Looking at a chart of nuclides, the stable isotopes of Tin (Sn) are around A=118. Tin has Z=50.

Consider the mass parabola for A=118. The minimum is expected to be around Z=50.

The energy released in beta decay comes from the difference in atomic masses.
For a single beta decay: Q = [M(A, Z) - M(A, Z+1)] c²

If the stable nucleus is Z=50, the process is a series of beta minus decays.
The total energy released is the difference in mass between the initial fragment and the final stable nucleus.

Energy = [M($^{118}_{46}Pd$) - M($^{118}_{50}Sn$)] c²

We can approximate this using the semi-empirical mass formula, focusing on the terms that change with Z for isobars (Coulomb and symmetry).
The energy difference between two isobars is approximately parabolic with respect to Z.

Consider the average binding energy per nucleon for nuclei around A=100-120. It's around 8.5 MeV.
The change in binding energy per nucleon when going to a more stable nucleus would be small.

Let's assume the answer choices provide reasonable values, and work backwards.
If Energy = 18 MeV for 4 beta decays, average energy per decay is ~4.5 MeV.
If Energy = 16 MeV for 2 beta decays, average energy per decay is ~8 MeV.
If Energy = 20 MeV for 5 beta decays, average energy per decay is ~4 MeV.
If Energy = 5 MeV for 1 beta decay, energy per decay is 5 MeV.

The most stable nucleus for A=118 is likely to have Z=50.

Consider the case of A=100. The stable isobars are around Ru (Z=44). For A=120, stable isobars are around Te (Z=52). So for A=118, it should be close to Z=50.

The energy released in beta decay is due to the weak interaction, and the Q-value is typically a few MeV. A value of 8 MeV per beta decay seems a bit high for a series of decays.

The most consistent answer seems to be (C) Z=50, Energy= 18 MeV.
