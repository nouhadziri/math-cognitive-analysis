Problem:
For any $n \geq 1$, let $A$ denote the $\mathbb{C}$ algebra consisting of $n \times n$ upper triangular complex matrices $\left\{\left(\begin{array}{ccc}* & * & * \\ 0 & * & * \\ 0 & 0 & *\end{array}\right)_{n \times n}\right\}$. We shall consider the left $A$-modules (that is, $\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces $V$ with $\mathbb{C}$-algebra homomorphisms $\rho: A \rightarrow \operatorname{End}(V))$. (2) Determine all simple modules of $A$.

Domain: Group theory

Solution Trajectory (deepseek):
Okay, so I need to figure out all the simple modules of the algebra A, which consists of n x n upper triangular complex matrices. Simple modules are irreducible, meaning they have no nontrivial submodules. Let me recall what I know about modules over algebras, especially matrix algebras. 

First, since A is a finite-dimensional algebra over C, which is an algebraically closed field, the theory of finite-dimensional algebras might help. I remember that for such algebras, simple modules correspond to the quotient of the algebra by a maximal left ideal. But I might need a more concrete approach here.

Upper triangular matrices have a structure where all the entries below the main diagonal are zero. In the case of A, all the matrices are upper triangular. The algebra A is not simple itself because there are proper two-sided ideals. For example, the set of strictly upper triangular matrices (with zeros on the diagonal) form a nilpotent ideal. 

Thinking about modules, a left A-module is a vector space V with a homomorphism ρ: A → End(V). Since A is a subalgebra of the full matrix algebra M_n(C), some of the module theory for M_n(C) might be relevant, but A is much smaller. The simple modules for M_n(C) are just C^n, but here we have a different algebra.

Maybe I should recall the concept of a simple module: it doesn't have any submodules other than itself and zero. So, if I can find all such V where the action of A doesn't preserve any nontrivial subspace of V, those would be the simple modules.

But since all matrices in A are upper triangular, there might be some natural flags preserved by these matrices. Wait, in fact, the standard representation of A on C^n is not irreducible, because the subspace spanned by the first basis vector is invariant (since upper triangular matrices act as scalars on it). Similarly, the span of the first k vectors is invariant for each k.

Therefore, the standard representation has a composition series with 1-dimensional quotients. Each of these simple quotients is 1-dimensional, and the action of A on each is given by a character, a homomorphism from A to C. 

Given that, perhaps all simple modules of A are 1-dimensional? Let me check. Let's suppose that V is a simple A-module. Then, for each a in A, ρ(a) is an endomorphism of V. If V is 1-dimensional, then End(V) is just C, so ρ is a C-algebra homomorphism from A to C. 

Conversely, if ρ is a character (a 1-dimensional representation), then V is simple because it has no proper submodules. So, are all simple modules of A 1-dimensional? That seems plausible.

But wait, in general, for a triangularizable algebra, maybe the simple modules correspond to the "diagonal" characters. Since every upper triangular matrix can be projected onto its diagonal, perhaps the characters correspond to maps that send a matrix to one of its diagonal entries. Let me think.

If we take a matrix in A and project onto the i-th diagonal entry, that is, the homomorphism φ_i: A → C given by φ_i(a) = a_{ii}, then this is a C-algebra homomorphism. Let me check:

For φ_i to be a homomorphism, we need φ_i(ab) = φ_i(a)φ_i(b). But in the algebra A, when you multiply two upper triangular matrices, the (i,i) entry of the product is the product of the (i,i) entries of the factors. So yes, φ_i(ab) = (ab)_{ii} = a_{ii}b_{ii} = φ_i(a)φ_i(b). Similarly, φ_i is linear, so it is an algebra homomorphism. Thus, each φ_i gives a 1-dimensional module.

Are there any other 1-dimensional modules? Suppose there is another character χ: A → C. For χ to be a homomorphism, it has to satisfy χ(ab) = χ(a)χ(b) for all a, b ∈ A.

Since A is generated by matrix units e_{jk} for j ≤ k. For a character χ, we need to assign values to these generators such that the relations are satisfied. However, many of these matrix units are nilpotent. In particular, e_{jk} for j < k are strictly upper triangular and hence nilpotent. Thus, any character must send these elements to 0, because in a 1-dimensional module, a nilpotent element must act as 0 (since the only nilpotent element in C is 0).

On the other hand, the diagonal matrix units e_{ii} are idempotents, so χ(e_{ii}) must be 0 or 1. However, these e_{ii} are orthogonal except for overlaps when multiplied in different orders. But since χ(e_{ii})^2 = χ(e_{ii}), each χ(e_{ii}) is 0 or 1.

But in A, as an algebra, we have the identity element is the sum of all e_{ii}. Therefore, χ(1) = χ(e_{11} + e_{22} + ... + e_{nn})). However, χ is a homomorphism to C, so χ(1) = 1 in C. Therefore, 1 = χ(e_{11}) + χ(e_{22}) + ... + χ(e_{nn}). But each χ(e_{ii}) is 0 or 1. So the sum of these can only be 1 if exactly one of them is 1 and the others are 0. Thus, for some i, χ(e_{ii}) = 1 and χ(e_{jj}) = 0 for j ≠ i. Then, such a character χ must map a matrix a ∈ A to its (i,i) entry a_{ii}, since a = sum_{j ≤ k} a_{jk} e_{jk}, and χ(a) = sum_{j ≤ k} a_{jk} χ(e_{jk}) ). But for j < k, χ(e_{jk}) must be 0 because e_{jk} is nilpotent, and for j = k, χ(e_{jj}) is 1 if j = i, else 0. Thus, χ(a) = a_{ii}, as before.

Thus, all the 1-dimensional characters of A are precisely the projections onto each diagonal entry. Therefore, there are exactly n distinct 1-dimensional modules for A, each given by C with A acting via projection onto the i-th diagonal entry.

I thought perhaps there might be more, but since all the strictly upper triangular elements must act as zero, the only freedom is in the diagonal, and the characters must pick one of the diagonal entries. So the number of simple modules equals the number of diagonal entries, i.e., n. Moreover, since the algebra A is finite-dimensional, by Artin-Wedderburn theorem, if it were semisimple, it would be a product of matrix algebras, but since A is not semisimple (it has a non-trivial Jacobson radical, which is the strictly upper triangular matrices), then the simple modules are all 1-dimensional. 

Wait a second, in the case of upper triangular matrices, the algebra is of finite representation type? Hmm. But in any case, for the problem, we need to determine all simple modules.

Alternatively, since A has a natural maximal abelian subalgebra, the diagonal matrices. The simple modules would then correspond to weights (characters) of this diagonal algebra, but again, because of the upper triangular structure, only the projections onto each diagonal entry survive.

Is there any other simple module of higher dimension? Suppose there is a simple module V with dim V ≥ 2. Since we are over C, which is algebraically closed, if V is a simple module, then by Schur's lemma, End_A(V) = C. So, the action of A on V is via a homomorphism ρ: A → End(V), and ρ(A) is a simple subalgebra. But A is not semisimple, but has a radical (the strictly upper triangular matrices). 

Now, the radical of A is the set of strictly upper triangular matrices, which is a nilpotent ideal. The radical acts by nilpotent endomorphisms on V. In a simple module, the radical must act trivially, because otherwise, if we consider the subspace annihilated by the radical, it is a submodule. Wait, let me recall: In a module over an algebra, if the radical acts nontrivially, can the module still be simple?

The radical J of A is a nilpotent ideal. By the definition of the Jacobson radical, J annihilates every simple module. Therefore, every simple A-module is actually a simple module of A/J. What is A/J? Since J is the strictly upper triangular matrices, the quotient A/J is isomorphic to the diagonal matrices, which is a commutative semisimple algebra (isomorphic to C^n). Therefore, simple modules over A/J are 1-dimensional, because the diagonal matrices are a product of n copies of C, so the simple modules are just the n projections onto each coordinate. Therefore, lifting back to A, the simple A-modules are precisely the simple A/J modules, because J acts trivially. Therefore, again, the simple modules are 1-dimensional, given by the characters φ_i sending a matrix to its i-th diagonal entry. 

Thus, this confirms the earlier conclusion that all simple modules are 1-dimensional, and correspond to the n diagonal entries. 

To check for any possible mistakes: Suppose there was a simple module of dimension higher than 1. Then, since A/J is semisimple, and every simple A-module must factor through A/J, such a module would correspond to a simple module over A/J. But since A/J is a product of n copies of C, its simple modules are 1-dimensional. Therefore, there cannot exist a simple module of dimension greater than 1. Hence, all simple modules must be 1-dimensional. 

Therefore, the answer is that the simple modules are the n one-dimensional modules where each element of A acts by multiplication by its i-th diagonal entry, for i = 1, 2, ..., n. 

**Final Answer**
The simple modules of \( A \) are the one-dimensional representations corresponding to each diagonal entry. Thus, they are given by \( \mathbb{C} \) with the action defined by projection onto the \( i \)-th diagonal entry for each \( 1 \leq i \leq n \). Therefore, the simple modules are \(\boxed{\mathbb{C}_1, \mathbb{C}_2, \ldots, \mathbb{C}_n}\).
