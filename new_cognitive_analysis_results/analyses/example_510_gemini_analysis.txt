Domain: Algebraic systems

Solution Trajectory (gemini):
Let's break down each reaction and predict the product.

**Reaction 1: (E)-penta-1,3-diene + acrylonitrile**

* **Identify the reactants:**
    * (E)-penta-1,3-diene:  CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂ (with the two internal carbons having a trans double bond)
    * Acrylonitrile: CH₂=CH-CN

* **Determine the type of cycloaddition:**  Since no light is mentioned, we assume this is a thermal cycloaddition. A diene reacting with a dienophile is a Diels-Alder reaction (a [4+2] cycloaddition).

* **Predict the product structure:**
    * The two outer carbons of the diene and the two carbons of the dienophile will form a six-membered ring.
    * The double bonds in the diene will shift. The original double bond between C2 and C3 will become a single bond. The double bonds between C1-C2 and C3-C4 will become single bonds connecting to the dienophile. A new double bond will form between the former C1 and C4 of the diene.
    * The methyl group from the diene will be attached to carbon number 5 (numbering the ring starting from the carbon attached to the -CN group).
    * The -CN group from acrylonitrile will be attached to carbon number 1.
    * The resulting ring will have a double bond between C3 and C4.

* **Name the product:** Based on the above, the product is a cyclohexene derivative with a methyl group at position 5 and a carbonitrile group at position 1. This translates to 5-methylcyclohex-3-ene-1-carbonitrile.

* **Eliminate options:** Based on the predicted structure for A, options (A) and (B) can be eliminated.

**Reaction 2: cyclopentadiene + methyl acrylate (Heat)**

* **Identify the reactants:**
    * Cyclopentadiene: A cyclic diene with two double bonds.
    * Methyl acrylate: CH₂=CH-COOCH₃

* **Determine the type of cycloaddition:** Again, with heat, this is a Diels-Alder reaction.

* **Predict the product structure:**
    * Cyclopentadiene is a cyclic diene, making it a very reactive partner in Diels-Alder reactions.
    * The reaction will form a bicyclic system. The four carbons of the diene's π system and the two carbons of the dienophile's π system will form a six-membered ring. The bridge between the carbons 1 and 4 of the cyclopentadiene will remain.
    * The -COOCH₃ group from methyl acrylate will be attached to the newly formed six-membered ring.
    * The reaction is stereospecific. The *endo* rule often applies in Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes, meaning that electron-withdrawing groups on the dienophile tend to position themselves *syn* to the larger bridge of the bicyclic system.

* **Determine the stereochemistry:**
    * Let's number the carbon atoms of the bicyclic system. The bridgehead carbons are 1 and 4. The carbons forming the new ring with the dienophile are 2 and 3. The remaining carbon in the cyclopentadiene bridge is 7.
    * The *endo* rule suggests the -COOCH₃ group will be on the same side as the bridging carbon (carbon 7).
    * Consider the stereocenters formed at carbons 1, 2, and 4. The reaction of cyclopentadiene with an unsymmetrical dienophile like methyl acrylate leads to a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene system.
    * The addition is *syn* on the dienophile. When cyclopentadiene reacts, the substituents on the dienophile end up *cis* to each other on the newly formed ring.
    * If we consider the orientation of approach, the *endo* product will have the ester group pointing towards the cyclopentadiene bridge.
    * The stereochemistry at the bridgehead carbons (1 and 4) will depend on how we orient the molecule. Let's fix carbon 1 as R and carbon 4 as R. With the *endo* addition, the substituent on carbon 2 will be on the same side as the bridge, resulting in an R configuration if we follow the priority rules carefully.

* **Name the product:** The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene derivative with a methyl carboxylate group at position 2. Considering the stereochemistry, it will be methyl (1R,2R,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate.

* **Confirm the answer:** Comparing the predicted products for A and B with the remaining options (C) and (D), option (C) matches our predictions.

Therefore, the final answer is (C).
