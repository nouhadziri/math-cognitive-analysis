Problem:
Two three-letter strings, $aaa^{}_{}$ and $bbb^{}_{}$ , are transmitted electronically. Each string is sent letter by letter. Due to faulty equipment, each of the six letters has a 1/3 chance of being received incorrectly, as an $a^{}_{}$ when it should have been a $b^{}_{}$ , or as a $b^{}_{}$ when it should be an $a^{}_{}$ . However, whether a given letter is received correctly or incorrectly is independent of the reception of any other letter. Let $S_a^{}$ be the three-letter string received when $aaa^{}_{}$ is transmitted and let $S_b^{}$ be the three-letter string received when $bbb^{}_{}$ is transmitted. Let $p$ be the probability that $S_a^{}$ comes before $S_b^{}$ in alphabetical order. When $p$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is its numerator?

Domain: Probability theory

Solution Trajectory (gemini):

The problem asks for the probability that the received string $S_a^{}$ (when $aaa^{}_{}$ is transmitted) comes before the received string $S_b^{}$ (when $bbb^{}_{}$ is transmitted) in alphabetical order.

Let the transmitted string be $T$. The received string $R$ is formed by receiving each letter of $T$.
If the transmitted letter is $a$, it is received as $a$ with probability $1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and as $b$ with probability $1/3$.
If the transmitted letter is $b$, it is received as $b$ with probability $1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and as $a$ with probability $1/3$.

Consider the transmission of $aaa^{}_{}$. The received string $S_a^{}$ has three letters. Each letter of $S_a^{}$ is the received version of an $a$.
Let the letters of $S_a^{}$ be $X_1, X_2, X_3$. Each $X_i$ is the result of transmitting $a$.
$P(X_i = a) = 2/3$
$P(X_i = b) = 1/3$
The letters $X_1, X_2, X_3$ are independent.

Consider the transmission of $bbb^{}_{}$. The received string $S_b^{}$ has three letters. Each letter of $S_b^{}$ is the received version of a $b$.
Let the letters of $S_b^{}$ be $Y_1, Y_2, Y_3$. Each $Y_i$ is the result of transmitting $b$.
$P(Y_i = b) = 2/3$
$P(Y_i = a) = 1/3$
The letters $Y_1, Y_2, Y_3$ are independent.

We want the probability that $S_a^{}$ comes before $S_b^{}$ in alphabetical order.
The alphabetical order of strings is determined by the first position where the letters differ.

Let $S_a^{} = x_1 x_2 x_3$ and $S_b^{} = y_1 y_2 y_3$, where $x_i \in \{a, b\}$ and $y_i \in \{a, b\}$.
We want $P(S_a^{} < S_b^{})$.

The condition $S_a^{} < S_b^{}$ occurs if:
1. $x_1 < y_1$, which means $x_1 = a$ and $y_1 = b$.
2. $x_1 = y_1$, and $x_2 < y_2$.
3. $x_1 = y_1$, $x_2 = y_2$, and $x_3 < y_3$.

Case 1: $x_1 = a$ and $y_1 = b$.
$P(x_1 = a) = 2/3$
$P(y_1 = b) = 2/3$
$P(x_1 = a \text{ and } y_1 = b) = P(x_1 = a) P(y_1 = b) = (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9$.

Case 2: $x_1 = y_1$, and $x_2 < y_2$.
Subcase 2.1: $x_1 = y_1 = a$, and $x_2 = a, y_2 = b$.
$P(x_1 = a) = 2/3$
$P(y_1 = a) = 1/3$
$P(x_1 = a, y_1 = a) = (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9$.
$P(x_2 = a) = 2/3$
$P(y_2 = b) = 2/3$
$P(x_2 = a, y_2 = b) = (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9$.
$P(x_1 = a, y_1 = a, x_2 = a, y_2 = b) = P(x_1 = a) P(y_1 = a) P(x_2 = a) P(y_2 = b) = (2/3)(1/3)(2/3)(2/3) = 8/81$.

Subcase 2.2: $x_1 = y_1 = b$, and $x_2 = a, y_2 = b$.
$P(x_1 = b) = 1/3$
$P(y_1 = b) = 2/3$
$P(x_1 = b, y_1 = b) = (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9$.
$P(x_2 = a) = 2/3$
$P(y_2 = b) = 2/3$
$P(x_2 = a, y_2 = b) = 4/9$.
$P(x_1 = b, y_1 = b, x_2 = a, y_2 = b) = P(x_1 = b) P(y_1 = b) P(x_2 = a) P(y_2 = b) = (1/3)(2/3)(2/3)(2/3) = 8/81$.

The event for Case 2 is $(x_1 = y_1) \cap (x_2 < y_2)$, where $x_2 < y_2$ means $x_2 = a, y_2 = b$.
$P(x_2 = a, y_2 = b) = P(x_2 = a) P(y_2 = b) = (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9$.

Consider the event $x_1 = y_1$.
$P(x_1 = a, y_1 = a) = (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9$.
$P(x_1 = b, y_1 = b) = (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9$.
$P(x_1 = y_1) = P(x_1 = a, y_1 = a) + P(x_1 = b, y_1 = b) = 2/9 + 2/9 = 4/9$.

$P((x_1 = y_1) \cap (x_2 = a, y_2 = b)) = P(x_1 = y_1) P(x_2 = a, y_2 = b)$, due to independence.
$= (4/9) \times (4/9) = 16/81$.

Case 3: $x_1 = y_1$, $x_2 = y_2$, and $x_3 < y_3$.
Here, $x_3 = a, y_3 = b$. $P(x_3 = a, y_3 = b) = (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9$.
We need the probability of $x_1 = y_1$ and $x_2 = y_2$.
$P(x_1 = y_1) = 4/9$.
$P(x_2 = y_2) = P(x_2 = a, y_2 = a) + P(x_2 = b, y_2 = b) = (2/3)(1/3) + (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 + 2/9 = 4/9$.
$P(x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2) = P(x_1 = y_1) P(x_2 = y_2) = (4/9)(4/9) = 16/81$.

The event for Case 3 is $(x_1 = y_1) \cap (x_2 = y_2) \cap (x_3 = a, y_3 = b)$.
$P((x_1 = y_1) \cap (x_2 = y_2) \cap (x_3 = a, y_3 = b)) = P(x_1 = y_1) P(x_2 = y_2) P(x_3 = a, y_3 = b)$
$= (4/9) \times (4/9) \times (4/9) = 64/729$.

The three cases are mutually exclusive.
$P(S_a^{} < S_b^{}) = P(\text{Case 1}) + P(\text{Case 2}) + P(\text{Case 3})$
Need to be careful with the definition of the cases.

Let's reconsider the conditions for $S_a^{} < S_b^{}$.
1. $x_1 = a, y_1 = b$. Probability = $(2/3)(2/3) = 4/9$.
2. $x_1 = y_1 = a$, and $x_2 = a, y_2 = b$. Probability = $(2/3)(1/3) \times (2/3)(2/3) = 2/9 \times 4/9 = 8/81$.
3. $x_1 = y_1 = b$, and $x_2 = a, y_2 = b$. Probability = $(1/3)(2/3) \times (2/3)(2/3) = 2/9 \times 4/9 = 8/81$.
   Probability of Case 2 = $P(x_1 = y_1) P(x_2 = a, y_2 = b) = (4/9)(4/9) = 16/81$.

Let's use conditional probability.
$P(S_a^{} < S_b^{}) = P(x_1 < y_1) + P(x_1 = y_1, x_2 < y_2) + P(x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, x_3 < y_3)$.

$P(x_1 < y_1) = P(x_1 = a, y_1 = b) = P(x_1 = a) P(y_1 = b) = (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9$.

$P(x_1 = y_1, x_2 < y_2) = P(x_1 = y_1) P(x_2 < y_2)$.
$P(x_2 < y_2) = P(x_2 = a, y_2 = b) = P(x_2 = a) P(y_2 = b) = (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9$.
$P(x_1 = y_1) = P(x_1 = a, y_1 = a) + P(x_1 = b, y_1 = b) = (2/3)(1/3) + (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 + 2/9 = 4/9$.
$P(x_1 = y_1, x_2 < y_2) = (4/9) \times (4/9) = 16/81$.

$P(x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, x_3 < y_3) = P(x_1 = y_1) P(x_2 = y_2) P(x_3 < y_3)$.
$P(x_3 < y_3) = P(x_3 = a, y_3 = b) = P(x_3 = a) P(y_3 = b) = (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9$.
$P(x_2 = y_2) = P(x_2 = a, y_2 = a) + P(x_2 = b, y_2 = b) = (2/3)(1/3) + (1/3)(2/3) = 4/9$.
$P(x_1 = y_1) = 4/9$.
$P(x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, x_3 < y_3) = (4/9) \times (4/9) \times (4/9) = 64/729$.

$p = P(S_a^{} < S_b^{}) = 4/9 + 16/81 + 64/729$.
Common denominator is 729.
$4/9 = 4 \times 81 / 729 = 324 / 729$.
$16/81 = 16 \times 9 / 729 = 144 / 729$.
$64/729 = 64 / 729$.

$p = (324 + 144 + 64) / 729 = 532 / 729$.

We need to check if this fraction is in lowest terms.
Prime factorization of 729: $9^3 = (3^2)^3 = 3^6$.
Prime factors of 532:
$532 / 2 = 266$
$266 / 2 = 133$
$133 = 7 \times 19$.
So, $532 = 2^2 \times 7 \times 19$.

Since the prime factors of the numerator and denominator are disjoint, the fraction is in lowest terms.
The numerator is 532.

Alternative approach: Compare letter by letter.
Consider the first position where the letters differ.

Event $E_1$: $x_1 < y_1$, i.e., $x_1 = a, y_1 = b$. $P(E_1) = 4/9$.
Event $E_2$: $x_1 = y_1$, $x_2 < y_2$, i.e., $x_1 = y_1$, $x_2 = a, y_2 = b$.
$P(x_1 = y_1, x_2 = a, y_2 = b) = P(x_1 = y_1) P(x_2 = a, y_2 = b) = (4/9) (4/9) = 16/81$.
Event $E_3$: $x_1 = y_1$, $x_2 = y_2$, $x_3 < y_3$, i.e., $x_1 = y_1$, $x_2 = y_2$, $x_3 = a, y_3 = b$.
$P(x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, x_3 = a, y_3 = b) = P(x_1 = y_1) P(x_2 = y_2) P(x_3 = a, y_3 = b)$
$= (4/9) (4/9) (4/9) = 64/729$.

The probability that $S_a^{}$ comes before $S_b^{}$ is $P(E_1) + P(E_2) + P(E_3)$.
$p = 4/9 + 16/81 + 64/729 = 324/729 + 144/729 + 64/729 = 532/729$.

Consider the case where $S_a^{} = S_b^{}$.
This happens if $x_i = y_i$ for $i=1, 2, 3$.
$P(x_i = y_i) = P(x_i = a, y_i = a) + P(x_i = b, y_i = b) = (2/3)(1/3) + (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 + 2/9 = 4/9$.
$P(S_a^{} = S_b^{}) = P(x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, x_3 = y_3) = P(x_1 = y_1) P(x_2 = y_2) P(x_3 = y_3)$
$= (4/9) \times (4/9) \times (4/9) = 64/729$.

Consider the case where $S_a^{} > S_b^{}$.
This happens if $y_1 < x_1$, or $y_1 = x_1, y_2 < x_2$, or $y_1 = x_1, y_2 = x_2, y_3 < x_3$.

Let $q$ be the probability that $S_b^{}$ comes before $S_a^{}$.
By symmetry, the probability of receiving $S_a^{}$ is the same as the probability of receiving $S_b^{}$ if the roles of $a$ and $b$ are swapped.

Let's check the probabilities of the possible received strings for $S_a^{}$ and $S_b^{}$.
For $S_a^{}$, possible strings are $aaa, aab, aba, baa, abb, bab, bba, bbb$.
$P(aaa) = (2/3)^3 = 8/27$.
$P(aab) = (2/3)^2 (1/3) \times 3 = 12/27$.
$P(abb) = (2/3) (1/3)^2 \times 3 = 6/27$.
$P(bbb) = (1/3)^3 = 1/27$.

For $S_b^{}$, possible strings are $bbb, bba, bab, abb, baa, aba, aab, aaa$.
Probabilities are the reverse of $S_a^{}$.
$P(bbb) = (2/3)^3 = 8/27$.
$P(bba) = (2/3)^2 (1/3) \times 3 = 12/27$.
$P(baa) = (2/3) (1/3)^2 \times 3 = 6/27$.
$P(aaa) = (1/3)^3 = 1/27$.

Consider the probability distribution of $S_a^{}$ and $S_b^{}$.
$P(S_a^{} = s)$ and $P(S_b^{} = s)$ for a three-letter string $s$.
If $s$ has $k$ $b$'s, $P(S_a^{} = s) = (2/3)^{3-k} (1/3)^k$.
If $s$ has $k$ $a$'s, $P(S_b^{} = s) = (2/3)^{3-k} (1/3)^k$.

We want $P(S_a^{} < S_b^{})$.
Consider the difference between the number of $b$'s in $S_a^{}$ and $S_b^{}$.
Let $N_a$ be the number of $b$'s in $S_a^{}$, $N_b$ be the number of $a$'s in $S_b^{}$.
$N_a \sim Binomial(3, 1/3)$.
$N_b \sim Binomial(3, 1/3)$.

Possible values of $N_a$: 0, 1, 2, 3.
$P(N_a = 0) = (2/3)^3 = 8/27$ (aaa)
$P(N_a = 1) = 3 (2/3)^2 (1/3) = 12/27$ (aab, aba, baa)
$P(N_a = 2) = 3 (2/3) (1/3)^2 = 6/27$ (abb, bab, bba)
$P(N_a = 3) = (1/3)^3 = 1/27$ (bbb)

Possible values of number of $a$'s in $S_b^{}$: 0, 1, 2, 3.
Let $M_b$ be the number of $a$'s in $S_b^{}$.
$P(M_b = 0) = (2/3)^3 = 8/27$ (bbb)
$P(M_b = 1) = 3 (2/3)^2 (1/3) = 12/27$ (bba, bab, abb)
$P(M_b = 2) = 3 (2/3) (1/3)^2 = 6/27$ (baa, aba, aab)
$P(M_b = 3) = (1/3)^3 = 1/27$ (aaa)

Consider the symmetry between the two processes.
The probability of receiving a string with $k$ $b$'s when $aaa$ is sent is the same as the probability of receiving a string with $k$ $a$'s when $bbb$ is sent.

Let $p = P(S_a^{} < S_b^{})$.
Let $q = P(S_a^{} > S_b^{})$.
Let $r = P(S_a^{} = S_b^{})$.
We calculated $r = 64/729$.
By symmetry, $p = q$.
$p + q + r = 1$.
$2p + r = 1$.
$2p = 1 - r = 1 - 64/729 = (729 - 64) / 729 = 665 / 729$.
$p = 665 / (2 \times 729) = 665 / 1458$.

Something is wrong. The symmetry argument assumes the probabilities of errors are the same for $a \to b$ and $b \to a$.

Let's verify the calculations.
$P(x_1 < y_1) = P(x_1 = a, y_1 = b) = (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9$.
$P(x_1 = y_1, x_2 < y_2) = P(x_1 = y_1) P(x_2 < y_2) = (4/9)(4/9) = 16/81$.
$P(x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, x_3 < y_3) = P(x_1 = y_1) P(x_2 = y_2) P(x_3 < y_3) = (4/9)(4/9)(4/9) = 64/729$.

The cases are based on the first position of difference.
Case 1: First difference at position 1, $x_1 = a, y_1 = b$.
Case 2: First difference at position 2, $x_1 = y_1$, $x_2 = a, y_2 = b$.
Case 3: First difference at position 3, $x_1 = y_1$, $x_2 = y_2$, $x_3 = a, y_3 = b$.

These cases are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities where $S_a^{} < S_b^{}$.

The probability of $S_a^{} < S_b^{}$ seems correct at $532/729$.
The numerator is 532.

$4/9 = 4 \times 81 / 729 = 324 / 729$.
$16/81 = 16 \times 9 / 729 = 144 / 729$.
$64/729 = 64 / 729$.

$p = (324 + 144 + 64) / 729 = 532 / 729$.</text>
<explanation>The solver combines the results from all cases, showing how systematic case analysis leads to a comprehensive solution by adding the probabilities of mutually exclusive events.</explanation>

<text>We need to check if this fraction is in lowest terms.
Prime factorization of 729: $9^3 = (3^2)^3 = 3^6$.
Prime factors of 532:
$532 / 2 = 266$
$266 / 2 = 133$
$133 = 7 \times 19$.
So, $532 = 2^2 \times 7 \times 19$.

Since the prime factors of the numerator and denominator are disjoint, the fraction is in lowest terms.</text>
<explanation>The solver methodically finds the prime factorizations of both the numerator and denominator to determine if the fraction can be simplified further, demonstrating the skill of fraction simplification.</explanation>

<text>Let's verify the calculations.
$P(x_1 < y_1) = P(x_1 = a, y_1 = b) = (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9$.
$P(x_1 = y_1, x_2 < y_2) = P(x_1 = y_1) P(x_2 < y_2) = (4/9)(4/9) = 16/81$.</text>
<explanation>The solver explicitly rechecks their probability calculations to ensure correctness, demonstrating self-verification.</explanation>
