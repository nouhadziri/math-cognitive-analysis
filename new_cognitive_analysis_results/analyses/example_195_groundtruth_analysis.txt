Problem:
Consider the following column vectors.

W = (1/sqrt(2), -i/sqrt(2))
X = (1/sqrt(3), i/sqrt(3), -i/sqrt(3))
Y = (1/2, -1/2, 1/2, -1/2)
Z = (-1/sqrt(5), sqrt(2/5), 0, sqrt(1/5), i/sqrt(5))

Choose the correct statement.
Answer Choices:
(A) 2 of the vectors can be the spin states of some n-electron system for n>= 1 (potentially different number of electrons for each vector).
(B) Y can be the spin state of a two-electron system and observing the state of one of the electrons will affect the state of the other.
(C) Z can be the spin state of qubit-qutrit quantum system.
(D) W can be the spin state of a quantum system of two fermions.

Domain: Linear algebra

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
The option '2 of the vectors can be the spin states of some n-electron system for n>= 1' is correct.
Electrons are spin 1/2 particles, and thus each electron correspond to a 2 dimensional system (their statevectors are of dimension 2). An n electron system, will have a statevector with dimension 2^n. Any statevector (regardless of the dimension) should have unit Euclidean norm. 
W and Y have unit Euclidean norm and their dimensions are 2 and 4, corresponding to 1 and 2 electron systems respectively. Since dimensions of X and Z are not powers of 2, this rules them out from being the state of multi-electron systems.
Hence we have 2 vectors corresponding to the potential states of multi-electron systems.

The option 'W can be the state of a two-fermion system' is wrong as fermions have half-odd integer spin and the fermion with the smallest spin has spin = 1/2 and 2 levels. So two particles would have 4 levels (number of levels of n particles is the product of number of levels of each particle) and therefore a two-fermion system will have at least 4 levels and thereby dimension of the vector must be at least 4.

'Y can be the spin state of a two-electron system and observing the state of one of the particles will affect the state of the other' is wrong. One half of the question is correct - Y, being a 4 dimensional unit vector, can be the statevector of a 2 electron system. However, the statevector corresponds to that of a separable state (can be factored as the tensor product of two 2-dimensional unit vectors) and being a separable state, observing the state of one of the electrons will not affect the state of the other. 

The statement 'Z can be the spin state of qubit-qutrit system' is wrong. A qubit statevector will have dimension 2 and a qutrit statevector will have dimension 3. A qubit-qutrit system will have dimension 2*3 = 6 and not 2+3 = 5. Z is a 5-dimensional vector.
