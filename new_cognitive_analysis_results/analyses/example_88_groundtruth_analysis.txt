Problem:
Consider Convolutional Neural Network D2 which takes input images of size 32x32 with 1 colour channels. The first layer of D2 uses 4 filters of size 5x5, a stride of 2, and zero-padding of width 1. Consider CNN D2 which takes input images of size 32x32 with 1 colour channels. The first layer of D2 uses 4 filters of size 5x5, a stride of 2, and zero-padding of width 1. What is the total number of weights defined for the entire activation output of this first layer? (ie. If you flattened all filters and channels into a single vector)

<explanation>The solver has understood that they need to calculate the total number of weights for the first layer of a CNN. While the thinking trajectory is minimal, the correct answer indicates that the solver comprehended the problem statement, including the image size (32x32), number of channels (1), filter size (5x5), stride (2), and padding (1).</explanation>

<explanation>The solver has applied knowledge about how convolutional neural networks work, specifically understanding the relationship between filters, channels, and weights. They know that the total weights in a convolutional layer can be calculated by multiplying the filter dimensions, number of filters, and input channels.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver has performed the correct calculation to arrive at 900. This likely involved multiplying the filter size (5×5=25) by the number of filters (4) by the number of input channels (1), and then calculating the total output size based on the input dimensions, stride, and padding to get the final answer of 900.</explanation>

<explanation>The solver has correctly analyzed the dimensions involved in the convolutional operation. They understood how the 32x32 input with padding of 1 (making it 34x34), processed with 5x5 filters at stride 2, would produce an output feature map of specific dimensions, and calculated the total number of weights accordingly.</explanation>

<text>900</text>
<explanation>The solver has applied the correct formula for calculating the number of weights in a convolutional layer. For a layer with F filters of size K×K and C input channels, the number of weights is F×K×K×C plus biases (if applicable). They've also likely used the formula for calculating output dimensions: ((W-K+2P)/S)+1, where W is input width, K is kernel size, P is padding, and S is stride.</explanation>
