Problem:
Jenny and Kenny are walking in the same direction, Kenny at 3 feet per second and Jenny at 1 foot per second, on parallel paths that are 200 feet apart. A tall circular building 100 feet in diameter is centered midway between the paths. At the instant when the building first blocks the line of sight between Jenny and Kenny, they are 200 feet apart. Let $t\,$ be the amount of time, in seconds, before Jenny and Kenny can see each other again. If $t\,$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?

<end>163</end>
<text>163</text>
<explanation>The problem requires understanding the spatial configuration of two parallel paths, a circular building between them, and the line of sight between two moving people. The solver must have visualized how the circular building blocks the line of sight and when it would allow Jenny and Kenny to see each other again based on their relative positions and speeds.</explanation>

<end>163</end>
<text>163</text>
<explanation>The solver had to create a mathematical model representing the movement of Jenny and Kenny along parallel paths, the geometric properties of the circular building, and the line of sight conditions. This would involve setting up equations for their positions as functions of time and determining when these positions would allow them to see each other again.</explanation>

<start>0</start>
<end>163</end>
<text>163</text>
<explanation>To solve this problem, the solver needed to set up and solve equations involving the positions of Jenny and Kenny over time, the geometry of the circular building, and the conditions for line of sight. This would require algebraic manipulation to isolate the variable t (time) and express it as a fraction in lowest terms.</explanation>

<start>0</start>
<end>163</end>
<text>163</text>
<explanation>The problem asks for t to be expressed "as a fraction in lowest terms" and then requests "the sum of the numerator and denominator." The answer 163 suggests the solver successfully simplified a fraction and added its numerator and denominator. This likely involved finding the greatest common divisor and reducing the fraction to its lowest terms.</explanation>

<text>163</text>
<explanation>The solver needed to analyze the rates at which Jenny and Kenny were walking (1 and 3 feet per second respectively) and determine how these rates affected when they would be able to see each other again after being blocked by the building. This involves calculating positions as functions of time and determining when specific spatial conditions are met.</explanation>
