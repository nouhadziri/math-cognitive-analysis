Problem:
Take the following differential equation:
\[3(3+x^2)\frac{dx}{dt}=2(1+x^2)^2e^{-t^2}\]
If  $x(0)\leq 1$ , prove that there exists  $M>0$  such that  $|x(t)|<M$  for all  $t\geq 0$ .

Domain: Differential equations

Solution Trajectory (groundtruth):
1. **Separate the variables:**
   \[
   3(3 + x^2) \frac{dx}{dt} = 2(1 + x^2)^2 e^{-t^2}
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \((1 + x^2)^2\) and multiplying by \(dt\), we get:
   \[
   \frac{3 + x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} dx = \frac{2}{3} e^{-t^2} dt
   \]

2. **Integrate both sides:**
   \[
   \int \frac{3 + x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} dx = \int \frac{2}{3} e^{-t^2} dt
   \]
   To integrate the left-hand side, we use the substitution \(u = x\), and for the right-hand side, we use the fact that the integral of \(e^{-t^2}\) is the error function, but we can leave it in integral form for now.

3. **Evaluate the integrals:**
   \[
   \int \frac{3 + x^2}{(1 + x^2)^2} dx = \frac{x}{1 + x^2} + 2 \arctan(x)
   \]
   \[
   \int \frac{2}{3} e^{-t^2} dt = \frac{2}{3} \int e^{-t^2} dt
   \]
   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \frac{x}{1 + x^2} + 2 \arctan(x) = c + \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-s^2} ds
   \]
   where \(c\) is the constant of integration determined by the initial condition \(x(0)\).

4. **Determine the constant \(c\):**
   \[
   c = \frac{x(0)}{1 + x(0)^2} + 2 \arctan(x(0))
   \]
   Given \(x(0) \leq 1\), we can evaluate \(c\) accordingly.

5. **Analyze the function \(f(u) = \frac{u}{1 + u^2} + 2 \arctan(u)\):**
   - The derivative of \(f(u)\) is:
     \[
     f'(u) = \frac{3 + u^2}{(1 + u^2)^2} > 0
     \]
     This shows that \(f(u)\) is strictly increasing and hence invertible.
   - The limits of \(f(u)\) as \(u \to \pm \infty\) are:
     \[
     \lim_{u \to -\infty} f(u) = -\pi, \quad \lim_{u \to \infty} f(u) = \pi
     \]

6. **Bound the integral:**
   - Since \(e^{-s^2} > 0\), we have:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-s^2} ds \geq 0
     \]
   - The upper bound of the integral is:
     \[
     \int_0^t e^{-s^2} ds \leq \int_0^\infty e^{-s^2} ds = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
     \]
     Therefore:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-s^2} ds \leq \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}
     \]

7. **Establish the bounds for \(c + \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-s^2} ds\):**
   - Since \(x(0) \leq 1\), we have:
     \[
     c \leq \frac{1}{1 + 1^2} + 2 \arctan(1) = \frac{1}{2} + \pi/2 = \frac{1 + \pi}{2}
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     c + \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-s^2} ds \leq \frac{1 + \pi}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}
     \]
     Let \(C_2 = \frac{1 + \pi + \sqrt{\pi}}{2}\), which is less than \(\pi\).

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Since \(f(u)\) is strictly increasing and bounded between \(-\pi\) and \(\pi\), and \(c + \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-s^2} ds\) is bounded between \(c\) and \(C_2\), there exists \(M > 0\) such that \(|x(t)| < M\) for all \(t \geq 0\).

<text>6. **Bound the integral:**
   - Since \(e^{-s^2} > 0\), we have:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-s^2} ds \geq 0
     \]
   - The upper bound of the integral is:
     \[
     \int_0^t e^{-s^2} ds \leq \int_0^\infty e^{-s^2} ds = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
     \]
     Therefore:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-s^2} ds \leq \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}
     \]</text>
<explanation>The solver establishes bounds for the integral by noting that e^(-s²) is positive (giving a lower bound of 0) and extending the upper limit of integration to infinity to find an upper bound. This demonstrates the ability to use inequalities to constrain the behavior of mathematical expressions.</explanation>

<start>1842</start>
<end>2239</end>
<text>7. **Establish the bounds for \(c + \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-s^2} ds\):**

     \[
     c \leq \frac{1}{1 + 1^2} + 2 \arctan(1) = \frac{1}{2} + \pi/2 = \frac{1 + \pi}{2}
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     c + \frac{2}{3} \int_0^t e^{-s^2} ds \leq \frac{1 + \pi}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{3}
     \]
     Let \(C_2 = \frac{1 + \pi + \sqrt{\pi}}{2}\), which is less than \(\pi\).</text>
<explanation>The solver continues the bounding process by using the initial condition x(0) ≤ 1 to establish an upper bound for the constant c, and then combines this with the previously established bound on the integral to find an overall upper bound for the expression. This shows systematic application of inequality-based reasoning.</explanation>

\(\blacksquare\)</text>
<explanation>The entire solution demonstrates strategic problem decomposition.

   \]
   where \(c\) is the constant of integration determined by the initial condition \(x(0)\).</text>
<explanation>The solver demonstrates mathematical modeling by creating a mathematical representation of the system that incorporates the initial condition x(0). They translate the differential equation into an implicit equation for x(t) that can be analyzed to understand the long-term behavior of the solution.</explanation>
